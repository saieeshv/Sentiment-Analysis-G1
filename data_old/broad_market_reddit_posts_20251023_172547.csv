VOO,1oaxxe9,Bogleheads,If i make enough money investing in VOO through a brokerage account over time to retire early or realize some of the gains; as long as I dont make over 47K taxable income said year then hypothetically wouldn’t it be tax free to withdraw gains (aside from state tax)?,(Trying to decide between accounts just want to make sure I understand) And if so is it still beneficial to go with roth ira over a brokerage account if im still fairy young and able to invest a decent chunk of my weekly paychecks into VOO and should have a pretty sizable amount well before the age of 60 with the compound interest accrued? Id like to be able to use portions of it before the age of 59 to help family members out of debt etc. Is the only drawback the 5% state income tax id have to pay on dividends and gains?

SPY,1o8h585,stocks,"October 16 Market Moment of Clarity: SPY Declines, Golden Dragon Index Drops Nearly 1%What's Next?","Today's market action was somewhat subdued, with all three major indices closing lower. The Golden Dragon China Index, tracking China-related tech stocks, dipped nearly 1%. While nothing particularly dramatic occurred, the market momentum seems to have weakened. After several weeks of steady gains, today carried a sense of “time to take profits.” Having traded stocks for so long, I typically balance short-term volatility with long-term holdings, occasionally adjusting some options based on earnings or macro events. Lately, I've been monitoring SPY, energy stocks, and some volatile Chinese ADRs. Some trading strategies still look promising, but the overall atmosphere feels heavier than before. I'm not suggesting this signals the start of any major event, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see more volatility before the market stabilizes.

SPY,1o19zvz,Bogleheads,Rebalancing from 100% SPY,"Before I discovered the Boglehead philosophy, I just put everything (both taxable and tax deferred) in SPY. For the past several years I've been migrating toward a three-fund portfolio. I've gotten as close as possible to my target allocation by rebalancing within tax-advantaged accounts, but I'm still pretty far away and have more risk than I want at < 10 years from retirement. Further rebalancing would require selling in taxable, which would incur 15% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT. Should I: * Rebalance with future purchases, and not worry about never reaching my target allocation. * Slowly rebalance, selling the largest gain lots first * Slowly rebalance, selling the smallest gain lots first * Rebalance all at once, and take a giant tax hit. (likely the worst option) * Something else I'd appreciate any advice or ideas. EDIT: I should have mentioned, I turned off dividend reinvestment as soon as I noticed the issue a few years ago. All SPY dividends get moved into VXUS, but SP500 growth has been so dramatic that it hardly makes a difference in the overall allocation. UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions. I've gone with option 3 - rebalance slowly by selling lots with small capital gains, and staying under the 15% LTCG rate.",48,21,2025-10-08 13:07:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1o19zvz/rebalancing_from_100_spy/,2025-10-23 09:13:50.315852,1.0,$SPY,0.5,[],['dividend'],0.9057142857142856

VOO,1nzggcq,investing,VOO and chill in retirement,"For those who like this approach, what's your plan in retirement? Say you have $1 mm in VOO, in today's prices you would hold 1626 shares. Let's say you need $4000\mo from your investment account to fund your living expenses on top of your ss income. You would need to sell 6.5 shares monthly or 78 shares yearly to meet this requirement. If voo grows at 14%, your growth will outpace your sells (228 new vs 78 sold) which is sustainable. But if the market drops like in the 2008 gfc, let's say your shares drop to $400 each, you'll need to sell 120 shares to meet your income needs. In this scenario your 1626 shares drop to 1506 shares. And each year until recovery your share count will drop. A 5 year recovery could mean a loss of 600 shares dropping to 1000 total, a 40% decline in your nest egg. Alternatively, would you consider investing in something like spyi instead? In today's prices you would hold 19,230 shares with $1mm. That would generate around $10,000\month in income. If the market tanked as in the above scenario, and say your investment income dropped by half, you would still have $5000\month investment income, without having to sell anything while still invested in a sp500 fund... Just like VOO. And if spyi continues in recovery to pay 12% while the sp500 grows at 14%, there should be no nav erosion either. Thoughts? Edit: correction to sp500 growth should probably be closer to 11% since inception rather than 14% (over the last 15 years).",53,221,2025-10-06 11:29:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nzggcq/voo_and_chill_in_retirement/,2025-10-23 09:14:51.663198,1.0,$VOO,0.8,[],['loss'],0.9057142857142856

I liked having a mix, and VYM is known for its dividend yield, AND also how it weathered the 2022 bear market. I'm having trouble finding the tools on Fidelity to compare both, including their dividends. While VYM only did +76% over the last 5yrs, and VOO around +101%, VYM carries the dividend factor that offsets some of that gap and brings it closer. What's your take on it, and where should I be looking forward? I've also begun investing in VGT, which is the tech sector - which I think is a hot one right now. Over 5yrs, that one did +145%!

Both VOO and VWRL are run by Vanguard, but one is in an American exchange and one is European. Despite that, both have holdings in American companies. So shouldn't VWRL also deduct dividend tax according to American law? (I'm asking specifically about the US withholding tax. I'm not worried about UK tax right now as I probably won't receive enough to go over a threshold. ) If VWRL is exempted, somehow, from these taxes.

VOO,1o7k4f0,investing,I bought QQQ in November of 2023. It has doubles since then: sell or hold???,"Context: I'm 45. AI will probably make my job obsolete in the next 5-10 years. I didn't rise above poverty until 2017. I make a modest income but it's not poverty anymore. I've only been saving and investing since then. I have ROTH IRA. I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job. I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years. I've thought that maybe I could sell the gains and put it in a safer investment, just play with the house's money. Or sell ALL of it, maybe I'm overexposed to the S & P 500. If you're bored at work, tell me what you would do. I want to hear some opinions to get my analyzing process flowing. EDIT: I misspoke, I actually invested in November 2022! Not 2023 as the subject line of this post says. So as of today its a 117% gain. I loved reading all the responses. I think I'm going to hold it all and let it ride. I'm pretty conservative in most other investments, my Roth IRA is managed by Fidelity, a boring mix of bonds and diversified stocks, but it helps me sleep at night. It feels right to have an all-in big swing as well. Through a little risk and a lot of luck I successfully timed the market on the fastest growing industry.

What is advised in terms of your stop losses for a large VOO holding in the case of a 15% pullback in the market? It seems, if you crunch the numbers, it would be wise to have a stop loss at 10% for the whole account, in the event of a catastrophe, and then try to buy back at the dip. Of course, there would be a tax situation, but that would only be relevant for gains, and I only have two years of gains with my set it and forget it VOO portfolio, and so my tax hit wouldn't be huge (this would change after years of course).

VTI,1o48yf4,Bogleheads,"Short, medium, and long term after a crash","I looked into what happened after the 2008 crash. I am just using SPY (S&P 500) and VDC (consumer staples) as examples here: you could use VTI or VT for broad market indexes and there are other ""stable"" sectors, like utilities, that this analysis should still hold true for. While both SPY and VDC fell in the crash, VDC fell less. While both recovered after the crash, VDC recovered a year and a half earlier. And while the S&P 500 has by far the better long term performance it took SPY well over a decade to catch back up to VDC. Bonds of course fell by less, holding their value better in the three years after the crash. VDC caught back up to BND in fall 2012, SPY caught back up to BND a year later. So there's three time ranges: - short term BND preserved spending power during and immediately - VDC recovered faster and provided better growth over the next ten years - long term S&P 500 dominates Therefore I'm thinking of allocating something like this: 40% VTI (VT if you want int'l) 30% VDC and similar 30% BND and similar (TIPS, bills) I think this might be better than 60/40 because it uses VDC to better fund the decade after a crash, and although VDC is slower growing, overall 70% equities is still pretty aggressive.

I know this is a bit tech-heavy and concentrated, but I work in the tech field and am okay with the added volatility in this smaller portion of our portfolio and will let it ride out and are okay with 20% dips. We just turned 30 and still feel comfortable with a higher aggressive tilt here, especially since it’s in our ROTH. For my SEP IRA, I’m hoping to contribute somewhere between $20k - $60k per year depending on how the work income looks. I’m currently deciding between keeping it super simple with VT, or splitting between VTI and VXUS to have more control over the US/international allocation. Thinking 70:30%. After going through this community I’m starting to like the simplicity of VT, but I also understand the flexibility of holding VTI and VXUS separately, so I’m open to guidance on that. Lastly, our emergency fund is also at Fidelity and parked in SPAXX. We’re keeping six months of expenses there, and our thought is to just let the interest sit and eventually use any overflow toward BND or another conservative option if it grows beyond what we need and add more once we get older. My goal is to stick with this plan long term and not overcomplicate things. I’d love feedback on whether this strategy makes sense for a hands-off, long-term approach, and if VT is a reasonable choice in the SEP IRA or if I’d be better off keeping the split with VTI and VXUS. Also open to any tax-efficiency tips for how we’re allocating across accounts. TLDR: Taxable: VTI Mine and my Wife's Roth: VUG / VGT, maybe BTC for fun.

VTI,1npk9m5,investing,Looking For Feedback On Brokerage Allocation?,"35M I made a post recently about being a little late to the game with Roth IRA accounts and just opened one not long ago. Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never. I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of 50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account. Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding. It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years. So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it. So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth. 35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks. currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

If so, is starting 401k now good for a target date of 2050 or am I too late??","I am 30 years old today. I just got into Bogle's little book of common sense investing. I love it. I am just now opening a 401k. I was a bad lad in life, never had no opportunities for 401k or other retirement. Finally kinda got my life together as a 30 year old. I'm setting up a 401k with my job, I'm starting a IRA which will automatically be taken from my paycheck as well, and then I'm going to start a two-fund portfolio of VTI and VXUS. At first, I thought I was smart to start my Roth IRA with VTI (70%) and VXUS (30%)... And my 401k with the same thing. Come to find out of course, my Roth IRA and two-fund portfolio are underway, I lay my eyes on the options for my 401k. ADMIRIAL? Target Date?? I then understood I was out of my element. I backed off, began to dig. Now I kind of understand. So, I was planning on utilizing the Rule of 55 at my company which offers it. As I am 30 today, that gives me 25 years to work things out. Am I being too optimistic to assume that I could retire via Rule of 55 and the funds from 401k, Roth IRA and 2-fund portfolio at that age? I planned on contributing 588 per month to my IRA, and same to my portfolio, 14 percent total going to my 401k. At that point, should I be putting my contributions to my 401k into a target retirement date fund for the year 2050? At 2055, I would be 60, which would be when I would look to cash out my IRA. Perhaps pumping all my money into Vanguard's target date 2055 fund would then be more optimal? I'm not sure what to do here.

However unless I have cash on hand to buy the dip that can’t really be done and to have cash on hand I’d have to risk missing out on returns now which may lead to less returns overall if a major dip doesn’t come soon. Big believer in the whole more money is lost hedging for a downturn than in the actual downturn. As an alternative to holding cash Iv been exploring holding leveraged funds during a downturn. Looking at charts of TQQQ it has had some enormous gains overall. Ik Ik it’s been an incredible bull run and that might not continue but not considering buying at highs and holding forever. Instead I was thinking something like at 10% draw back of QQQ shifting contributions to TQQQ which would make up a really small portion of my portfolio then every couple weeks re evaluate. If it continues to drop keep contributing to it. At say a 30% drop start shifting holdings to TQQQ and so on buying all the way down. As an exit strategy I would sell and put it back to normal allocations of S&P500 international, etc. once market returns to a new ATH or maybe just hold 1 more year.

VTI,1o1tlzd,Bogleheads,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability. But that aside, why would someone choose broad based funds like VTI or VOO over more focused options like SP100 or SCHG? Edit: Thanks everyone!

VTI,1o0qkkw,Bogleheads,Diversified funds with factor tilts,"Not a finance professional -- just an academic in an unrelated field and a curious DIYer posting this for discussion purposes. I’ve long thought the ICAPM provides an intuitively appealing framework for asset pricing, capturing investor heterogeneity and hedging demands. I am also sold on the the Fama–French factor models as solid empirically grounded ways of operationalizing ICAPM-like ideas (regardless of whether the expected returns associated with these additional factors truly reflect risk premia or some behavioral quirks/tastes of typical investors). Given this, I’ve been interested in the “Core” funds from DFA. What seems attractive is their built-in application of factor tilts across the full cross-section of stocks (e.g., value tilts across all size ranges, and size tilts across the value-to-growth spectrum and across sectors), rather than manually combining a market fund and small-cap-value fund to get tilts (e.g., VTI + a bit of AVUV). Historically, DFA’s funds were not accessible to DIYers, but now with the ETFs conversion with low expense ratios (about 0.15–0.20%), seem viable. Ran some basic regressions against the Fama-French 5 factors + momentum data from Ken French's website. Plot is attached showing estimated factor exposures and historical performance for some of these ETFs (net of expense ratios). I extended the timeline back to before the funds became ETFs by using the corresponding mutual fund tickers for that period (when known). Based on regressions, DFAC and DFAX appear to be reasonable subs for VTI and VXUS respectively in terms of market coverage, but with light-to-moderate factor tilts (betas around 0.2 for size, value etc.) if one is interested in getting exposures to those like I am. Thoughts? Caveats? DFUS was another interesting one to to see. While the regression makes it clear that it's just an index-fund (market beta of 1, zero beta for other factors), it still seems to have realized slightly higher returns (\~1% more) than VTI (at least in this short period). Any idea if this is just coming from some clever implementation choices given that they are not constrained to track an index too tightly or passively?",38,39,2025-10-07 20:39:55,https://i.redd.it/p9np2ly12rtf1.png,2025-10-23 09:12:14.044064,0.8,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999

VOO,1ob3vv7,Bogleheads,Asset Location Question,"We all know that the sequence is: HSA ($4400/year, $366/month) Roth IRA ($7500/year, $625/month) Trad 401k ($24500/year, 2042/month) Taxable (no limits) HSA+Roth IRA+401k Total ($36400/year, $3033/month) Yes, I know 401k up to match comes ahead, but for this discussion, it won't matter because we can max them all, and then some. If I have all these accounts available to me, and my desired asset allocation is: 60% VOO (S&P500) 30% VXUS (ex-US) 10% AVUV (US Small Value) Let's pretend I can invest $10k/month (I wish, hypothetical) What is the most tax-efficient way to spread the $10k/month? Without doing much reseach, from the top of my head, I know: VOO is tax-efficient so put it in Taxable AVUV is expected to grow the most so put it in Roth IRA VXUS in Taxable for Foreign Tax Credit I feel like the most tax-efficient way will have a little bit of this here, a little bit of that there. Then it gets complex. So I think, doing simply this: 60% VOO (S&P500) or it's equivalent 30% VXUS (ex-US) or it's equivalent 10% AVUV (US Small Value) or it's equivalent In your HSA, In your Roth IRA, In your 401k (if available) Treat each bucket as its own instead of treat all your buckets as one is the simplest thing to do despite being not the most tax efficient. I mean. these ETFs are already tax-efficient to begin. Maximizing on taxes by ""perfecting asset location"" seems too much work. I don't even have bonds in this example.

QQQ,1o8rou6,investing,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"\[Cross-posted to r/ETFs\] I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun... I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors. Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23. **TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.** **Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more? I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots. source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp) **Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision: Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold Todd J. Barre: For Brian Hartigan: For Victoria J. Herget: For Marc M. Kole: Withhold Yung Bong Lim: For Joanne Pace: For Gary R. Wicker: For Donald H. Wilson: Against **Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs. *Invesco, do better by your shareholders if you're going to be mailing and calling me EVERY.

VOO,1nr37sf,Bogleheads,Move out of FZROX into VOO?,"Let me preface this with... I wish I had found this (and other) subreddits before starting to make some of these moves. My income situation has improved recently and I've maxed out all of my tax-sheltered options so I'm now putting money into taxable accounts. By default, I put my first couple of contributions into FZROX, because mutual funds were what I knew for diversified investment (or so I thought...) In the interim, I did more reading/found more reddits and discovered the potential tax surprise/drag implications of carrying mutual funds on a taxable account, and started contributing into VOO instead. My intention is to continue doing that, maybe with some into some broader exposure ETFs (though I don't particularly see the need right now, following the S&P seems to be the way to go). Now, I'm in a position where I'd like to protect myself long-term and get out of FZROX, but I've also made some fairly significant gains in FZROX due to market performance this year so moving out of it will cost me a pretty penny. I've already resigned myself to waiting until the year mark so I can take the long-term capital gains rate, but even then that's still going to cost me a good chunk of those gains. I'm really not a fan of trying to time the market, I would rather set it and forget it, so this is where I'm at right now... do I just leave what I have in FZROX in there and take the tax hits as they come? Do I move out immediately as soon as I hit the capital gains rate? Or do I bide my time and try and take advantage of a downturn to make that move?

SPY,1ocdk6m,wallstreetbets,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard. The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution. You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a >20% drop the next week. **The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:** A wise man once told me history is a flat circle. Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/). The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total). [Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a) Now, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls. If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26 GLD 500C option (the farthest OTM currently available) at the current price of 2.14 (market close 20OCT25): **Scenario 1 (1979-1980 Repeat) - GLD doubles to 800 by end of year: Option has $300 of intrinsic value; 14,300% return** **Scenario 2 (Partial Repeat) - GLD increases 50% to 600 by end of year: Option has $100 of intrinsic value; 4,760% return** **Scenario 3 (Continuing trend) - GLD increases 25% to 500 by end of the year: Option has estimated $10 of extrinsic value 2 weeks from expiration; 476% return** **Scenario 4: GLD doesn't increase that much: -100% return** Now, I spy the glint of gold in many of your eyes. But others are muttering among yourselves, “Yet another meme stock. Last time I played one of those, my wife's boyfriend grounded me for a week.“ But here is why gold is uniquely positioned for such a move: gold is a physical object that has served as a trusted store of value for literally all of recorded history. I'll bet almost everyone here has at least one grandparent who hoards precious metals like a geriatric dragon. As a result, many poor souls who've never even heard of meme stocks will plunge into this frothing storm without knowing the perils of speculative markets They don't need charts or a brokerage to buy gold; they just go to their nearest Coin and Jewellery store with their Wendy's paycheck. A second factor today is the sheer access to leverage that did not exist in the 1979's-1980s. Back then, no ETFs even existed. No GLD, no SLV, nothing. And you had to call your broker to place a trade. But today, any room-temperature IQ degenerate can YOLO their entire net worth into 0dte calls on margin at the touch of a button. We just live in an era of rapid and rampant speculation. So now, let me give you a little background on the state of gold in general. If your bored, you can just skip ahead to my positions and exit strategy. **Gold Distribution:** Across the world, there is only 216,000 tons of gold in circulation as of the end of 2024. Approximately half is held as jewelry which includes 34,600 tons and 31,000 tons held by Indian and Chinese households, respectively. Another 38,000 tons is held by central banks. 49,000 tons are held as bars and coins (including ETFs) and finally, 32,000 tons in other uses (industrial, etc).

While mining efforts are likely ramping up, this should not impact supply that much over the duration of our voyage. [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/research\/gold-demand-trends\/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024](https://preview.redd.it/rv3h9wq6zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4135b0c31f240f3bc13cfb6e5ffdec5b37e7e6) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-v0te84o9rgwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bed6835419fbf38ed1d44e180b263493cd0c18d) A greater risk for supply is for people to start selling their gold bullion or jewellery to take advantage of the high prices which is listed as Recycled Gold in the chart above. During 2024, this accounted for 1370 tons, but this will undoubtedly increase as the price of gold increases. In accounts of the 1979-1980 mania, there were suddenly many gold and silver buyers popping up near the end; the modern equivalent would be getting spam texts asking you to sell your silver and gold (like you get for houses currently). This will be a sign the end is near. I will also be monitoring headlines for news of mass retail selling of gold and silver, especially in places like India and China where the population owns a tremendous amount of gold.

The US has been unable to get spending under control and continues to spend like a drunken pirate on shore. While the US is highly unlikely to actually default, the government will print to meet debt requirements, devaluing the currency. If you knew that you would be taking an inflationary haircut on any of your treasury holdings, would you really keep as many? https://preview.redd.it/teqt2yrfzgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=605469cc135657a8d1d1e2fe6e2ee445b0180320 Another common talking point driving gold prices is that Central banks are buying lots of gold and several countries, notably Turkey, have laws which gives the central bank the right to buy any gold produced in the country at market prices. Overall, Central Banks bought over 1000 tons of gold in 2023 and 2024. Gold has increased to over 20% of all central bank holdings while US treasuries have fallen.

This currency would serve as replacement for the US Dollar for trade in a scenario where another hegemonic power did not arise. **Position and Sizing:** As an established pirate, my chest of booty has well over a million doubloons from plundering the land o’ Kohls. If GLD sinks down to Davy Jone’s locker, most of me plunder will remain safe. Don’t be blinded by your greed and wager your whole ship.

SPY,1ns8te3,wallstreetbets,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K. Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right? Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early. One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in) I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week) I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time. There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further. Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

VTI,1nwy5o4,Bogleheads,Gains in taxable pushing me off target - is it worth selling and paying LTCG taxes?,"My target allocation is 70% stocks and 30% bonds. I’m about 5-7 years away from retirement. Right now, I’m maxing out my 401(k) contributions and using those funds to buy a bond fund. In my taxable account, I hold only VTI, which has been growing faster. At this point, my taxable account is filled with VTI, and my 401(k) is filled with bonds. Because of the growth imbalance, my overall portfolio is already at 75/25, and it keeps drifting further away from my target. Is my best option to accept that maintaining a balanced portfolio is more important than minimizing taxes?

VTI,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :) I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people. I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion! **Portfolio Construction Rules** To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT. Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK. Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY. Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD. **So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD** Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure. **Reasoning** I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns. Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm. Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe). Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms... This leads to the value premium. However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed. Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns. However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices. We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love. Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time... Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts. The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion. For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation. I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own). It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500 It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade. The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed. So... What do you do about all of that? Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance. As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period. If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth."" Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%. To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns. Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index. Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do. However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above. **The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach. **Performance Analysis** Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like: MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio **Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR** **VT Return: 11.16% CAGR** Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems: We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult. This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT. Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy. For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it... **Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR** For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds. Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78% Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56% Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller. This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe. That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR** That's some significant outperformance! Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...) Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings. There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy... But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising **I know that was a long post... thanks for reading :)** **Thoughts?**",0,9,2025-09-28 03:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nse5u1/using_mgk_schd_and_schy_to_create_a_value_and/,2025-10-23 09:12:00.670802,0.6000000000000001,$VTI,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'revenue', 'profit', 'split']",0.7342857142857142

While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out.

Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**. 2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos. 3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect. I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps. Now, I’ll keep it real with you: * Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical. * Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things. * User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue. * CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times. **Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits. **Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks.",334,229,2025-10-02 00:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,2025-10-23 09:14:24.482328,0.55,$SPY,1.0,['SNAP'],"['bull', 'puts', 'moon', 'yolo', 'revenue']",0.9285714285714285

VTI,1nsteob,Bogleheads,Staying the course - A quick analysis of how Vanguard strategies perform in a crash.,"I've been a Boglehead for around a decade now. During these wild economic times I felt the need to re-evaluate my allocations and do a bit of research to be sure my strategy makes sense. **TL;DR** The best approach turned out to be the same as the guides and Vanguard books I've always followed. For your investment dollars, choose a Lifestrategy fund using the typical 4 broad market funds (VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX, VTABX) that matches your risk tolerance and is based on how close you are to retirement, or go with a Target Retirement date if you know when you want to be more bond cautious and not need as much growth. **ANALYSIS**: The AI stock concentration appearing to be an economic bubble, rising wealth concentration is at levels nearing the roaring 20s, labor market is deteriating, inflation increases, dollar decline, and other factors have me very wary of a big correction in the next 2-5 years. I ran some calculations how this would go with a few scenarios to see if it matches the wisdom of the subreddit: * 3 fund approach **US total market + Total international + US total bond market** * 4 fund approach (Lifestrategy/Target Retirement which **adds International Bonds**) * 5 fund approach (Added 10% into VTIPS) * Compared Lifestrategy income, moderate and growth strategies to compare risks and returns. Thankfully, the results corroborated the general Boglehead guides. In general, the 3, 4 or 5 fund approaches had very little effect on the affect of the crash or returns at all. The difference was 1-2% for each crash with only .4% variation in 5 year annualized returns. As expected, the main difference is the stock/bond mix in regards to some sort of ""AI stock crash"" hitting mega cap and other markets. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -4%with faster breakeven in 2 years. * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -15% with a recovery in 3-4 years * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of 21% with recovery in 4-5 years. However that just shows drawdown and breakeven without the focus on long term gains. So I compared the three fund mixes using the 2008 crash and focused on the 15 year return. This showed what matters. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -12%with 15 year return of 3.8% * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -25% with a 15 year return of 7.7% * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of -40% with a 15 year return of 9.5%. As for risk, because Vanguard uses broad market funds it's fairly insulated against a Mega-cap crash instead of just making risky AI bets. VTI for example holds \~4k us stocks with mega, mid and small cap companies, across all major sectors. So, despite me believing strongly we're going to correct soon, it's clear no one is smart enough to know when that will occur and by trying to time that I miss out on all the gains. Basically, it appears best to pick the fund based on your target retirement dates or pick the Life Strategy and adjust as you approach retirement while riding out the volatility. Don't let the initial drawdown prevent you from getting those sweet growth gains. We can't plan for every scenario, and we can't predict the market, which is why we're all here anyway to be more passive while still making gains.That way, if you are close to retirement you get hit with a lower drawdown while not caring about the eventual bigger returns as you focus on stability, and if you have 15 years to retirement you get to ride out the heavier drawdown with a much larger 15 year return. Hope that helps some of you rest easier with a simple 4 fund Lifestrategy/Target Retirement Vanguard approach. **SOURCES:**[https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html) [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9) [https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:\~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble).

VTI,1o270sd,Bogleheads,Best way to move out of individual stocks,"I'm a 45 year old about 35% of my portfolio in individual stocks. Much of it is in concentrated in tech / AI companies. My stretch goal is to partially retire by 55. This year I finally made an investment policy statement and rebalanced my portfolio. As you might imagine, I'm heavily overweighted into tech stocks. Once you add in my VTI holdings, around 50% of my portfolio is in tech. Psychologically I'm finding it a little tough to sell these for two reasons: the tax hit, and the performance gap. My brokerage volatility is quite high on a day to day basis, but this batch of stocks is up 75% in two years in aggregate (after I sold the losers, so performance is overweighted). I'd like to gradually start selling off my individual stock holdings and moving everything to an index fund strategy. I'm curious to hear from others that have done this about the best. My rough plan: 1. \[Complete\] sell off underperforming stocks to take their losses 2. Sell off *highest performing stocks* first, up to the cap gains limit for 15% tax treatment 3. Sell the remainder stepwise until I'm completely transitioned out, without exceeding the 15% CG limit As for #2, the logic is that the highest performing stocks take the lowest tax hit in terms of my net gains versus expected gains, and they're also more likely to have higher volatility and potentially fall from greater heights.

I've been lurking this sub for a while and I never really had the money to make significant investments, but my situation changed and I want to set myself up for the future. I'm 24M living at home with my parents, no expenses besides gas/insurance, leisure, and additional food outside of what's cooked for dinner. I got hired at the post office so I left my old job, and was recently able to over my old employee sponsored 401k plan into a Roth IRA (my reasoning being that I'm in a low tax bracket and I'd know exactly how much I could pull out once the time comes). I don't come from much financial knowledge or success, I grew up and still live in a HCOL area (Long Island, NY) and I've seen what my parents have had to do to keep food on the table and while I greatly appreciate it, I don't want to put myself through the same type of stress. My first question is: What should I invest my IRA holdings in for the most amount of growth over the long term? From what I've learned, I'm assuming I can just buy all VT just to set it and forget it for a while as i continue to contribute, then down the line diversify my contributions for more stability. My goal is to retire as early as possible, and the fastest way to do that seems to be getting your money to work for you as much as possible. Since starting my new job, I cleared all my credit card debt and have a plan to pay off my student loans by the end of 2026. After that I don't have any debt and don't plan to incur any until I can start considering buying a house hopefully in the next 10 years. I buy my cars off Marketplace in cash so no worries about payments, pay my insurance policy in full so that it's a one time expense, and I've been adjusting my lifestyle to significantly cut down on leisurely spending and focus on investing in my future. My Roth has about $9k after the rollover, but most of it has been sitting uninvested the last couple days due to me not wanting to make a costly wrong decision or accidentally set myself back. Outside of my IRAs I've bought $1k in both VOO and VTI so that I'd at least be making something while I mull over the decision, any and all advice is greatly appreciated so thank you guys in advance!",23,18,2025-10-19 13:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oapx46/vt_and_chillright/,2025-10-23 09:12:14.026081,0.5,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999

VOO,1ntzajp,investing,"In investing, what are the advantages and disadvantages of growth vs. dividend investing?","If you've ever been to r/Bogleheads or r/dividends, you've seen two ends of a spectrum where both are convinced the other side are idiots. Personally, I lean in the Boglehead direction, but I'd really like to expand my knowledge and get a better idea of the overall pros and cons of both sides. I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

QQQ,1npgter,stocks,Stagflation Sell-off Incoming,"Unemployment rate is ticking up and the Fed has described their dual mandate: lowering unemployment rate while making sure inflation doesn't run up on us. This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates. Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers. Short-term I'm buying puts on QQQ as risk sells off. Long-term, I'm betting on $PATH being a long-term winner as the narrative shifts toward companies automating more processes with less human labor.",0,42,2025-09-24 16:28:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npgter/stagflation_selloff_incoming/,2025-10-23 09:16:50.115111,0.5,$QQQ,0.9,['PATH'],['puts'],0.7057142857142856

VTI,1odk5en,Bogleheads,Helping Retired In-laws (70s; $400k Portfolio w/ Pension) - allocation and risk mitigation advice!,"Hi all - I’ve found myself in an unexpected situation and was hoping to get some feedback as I help my in-laws with their finances. About a month ago, my mother-in-law asked me to step in because she’s unfamiliar with investing, and my father-in-law (who used to handle this) now has early Alzheimer’s. They’re both retired, mid-70s, living a simple life in California. They’re wonderful people, and I’ve been honored to help them even if it’s been a bit heartbreaking uncovering some poor advice they received over the years. I’ve spent the last month getting my head around their financial situation and uncovering the various accounts and assets/liabilities. I feel like I’ve finally found >95% of the big ticket items (though I’m sure other surprises are in store). Here’s a breakdown of their situation. ASSETS: * Home: worth $875K, mortgage \~$275K @ 3% interest * Rental home (in different state): owned outright and worth \~$125K * Currently rents for \~$700/month * Credit Union Cash: \~$40K * Retirement accounts: \~$400K total * TSP: $230k * Federal retiree account - currently 100% in the G Fund - essentially a Money Market Fund * Currently drawing $1,667/month ($20k/yr) * Traditional IRA: $12k * Roth IRA: $100k * Joint Taxable Brokerage: $80K * Unfortunately stuck in older mutual funds (ACAAX, KAUFX, TFFYX with unknown cost basis so I’m hesitant to liquidate and buy VTI, etc) INCOME: * Combined Social Security: \~$3,200/month * Federal Govt Pension: $2,366/month * California pension: \~$1,050/month * TSP Withdrawal: \~$1,667/month ($20k/yr) * Rental income: \~$700/month * Total Income: around $9,000/month, * Avg Monthly Spend: $8–9k/month HEALTH & TIME HORIZON: * Father-in-law: early Alzheimer’s, mild but worsening * Mother-in-law: multiple cancer survivor, health fragile * Life Horizon: I really hope for 5–10+ years, but it could realistically be less * If she passes first, memory care would be required and cost $8–10K/month, which is my biggest worry right now GOALS: 1. First, simplify and consolidate (thankfully almost done) 2. Preserve capital with minimal risk while not losing a ton to inflation/debasement (sadly this was not the case the last several years) 3. Be strategic about asset allocation with goal of earning modest growth above inflation without taking unnecessary market risk 4. Keep things easy for our family as their health continues to decline 5. Preserve flexibility if memory care or medical costs rise sharply BACKGROUND TIDBITS: * My FIL is very conservative by nature (hence the vast majority of his retirement savings in cash/MMF) and it was a multi-week endeavor to convince him to consolidate from 8 different custodians to 3, so keeping things conservative (despite my nature) so he remains comfortable is my guiding principle. * MIL is 100% trusting of my advice for the retirement accounts in her name. * I’m sure the moment I invest any cash, the market will crash - such is life. I’m fine with that, but it’s one reason I’m cautious. QUESTIONS: 1. What allocation makes sense given their age and situation 1. Initial thought was 80% cash and 20% invested? 2. Given their background, what is the recommended approach to allocation and risk in each bucket/account type? 1. My initial thought was to be more aggressive with a VTI type allocation in the Roth/traditional IRA accounts and to stick with the Money Market Fund G in the TSP. Does this make sense? 2. The TSP is currently 100% in the G Fund. Is that too conservative, or appropriate given their age and situation? 3. If memory care is needed in the future (or any higher level of medical care), would it make more sense to draw from the Roth accounts first, or take the tax hit on the brokerage accounts with the old mutual funds? I’m trying to play out the sequencing of what to liquidate first, and then use that to backwards plan the investment choices. 4. If I were going to invest the $100K in Roth funds, what options would you recommend? VTI? Target Date Fund? Other? 5. For the Roth/traditional IRAs, there’s about $62k in cash (also $10.5k in FDVV and $25.5k in FZROX). Since they can’t add cash to these accounts any more (no longer working), should they keep dry powder in cash for a downturn, or just invest to the allocation percentages we decide? 6. Any advice on handling the older taxable mutual funds? 7. What are the most common mistakes you've seen made when managing money for aging parents? If anyone has traversed this type of trail, I’d be grateful for any advice on the questions I asked or the questions I should’ve asked, but didn’t.

VTI,1nwc7w5,Bogleheads,When is it time to change your mindset from building your wealth to sustaining your wealth.  when is it time to buy that very first share of BND?,"TL;DR - When do you stop playing offense and start playing defense? Hey Bogleheads, longtime investor here, and been listening to the bogleheads podcast for years. Need some help from the Bogleheads community. So some background, my entire portfolio is pretty much all VT. My 401k is both VTI and VXUS equivalents, and my brokerage, IRA, HSA is all in on VT. I do this because I have been investing my entire adult life, I follow jack bogles principles by living below my means, investing heavily, and keeping the funds really low cost. I have read a couple of his books. As a millennial, I have been refraining of owning any bonds because I was always in the mindset of building my wealth. I grew up poor, and was always inherently fine with stomaching big market losses in order to continue to buy VT at a sale. Of course if I ever randomly experienced an enormous windfall, like winning the lottery, getting a huge inheritance, or striking oil, then I would obviously not be needing to build my wealth anymore and can just be fine with sustaining the wealth. At that point I would by all means be opting to a 50% stocks 50% bonds portfolio as Jack Bogle suggests. From there on out be financially free to do as I please. So this raises the question I have to the community at what point do you flip that switch? At what point do you have a large enough portfolio to start getting out of the mindset of building your wealth and start entering the mindset of sustaining your wealth. I don't believe it is necessarily a matter of age, but a matter of portfolio size. If you are 20 and have $10M, you should be sustaining wealth. If you are 60 and have $50k, then you should be building your wealth. If a man had a median income and was investing heavily into VT with each and every paycheck, and he got a raise that matched inflation to keep himself at the median all his working career, at what point in the portfolio size would he optimally go from 100% VT and enter the phase of 99% VT and 1% BND and start tickering off percent by percent until he reached a 50/50 portfolio.

SPY,1nyuk3i,investing,Did the math on ETF vs individual stock investing and the result was surprising,"Please feel free to pick apart my math because I didn't find a great formula for calculating the amount w/DRIP after 10 years to take into account average dividend growth rates as well, but it scarcely seems to matter when the [ETF #s get compared to individual stocks](https://imgur.com/a/Nh52dCb) over the same time period. Bare in mind, I did these calculations several months ago and added a couple on the back end that I was interested in for the sake of comparison, as you can see, but it didn't matter how I structured it. If you take the [most common top 10 holdings of well known ETFs ](https://imgur.com/a/c8T0APf)and diversify with just those 10 you should have beaten SPY and QQQ. The caveat being, of course, that no one had something like NVDA in their top 10 in 2015 but many of the other companies have been mainstays for >5 years. So you would have to occasionally rearrange your portfolio to accommodate the top 10 for your preferred investing style, but likely not by much. The second thing I found interesting was [how ""dividend-focused"" ETFs performed ](https://imgur.com/a/DQwfR36)relative to those that are tracking specific indices or sectors. Despite having large holdings in ""growth"" companies that offer very low dividends, too. I think this reaffirmed my choice to use SCHD to hedge against market downturns but if I were 100% growth focused I wouldn't use that one either. I debate the strengths and weaknesses of dividend focused investing routinely, but I think the conclusion is that by the very nature of offering large dividends those companies are going to be growing more slowly. However, by common sense and the data, those companies tend to also be more stable during market corrections. So if you lean bearish then higher investment in those types of companies (not necessarily the ETFs) could still play to your favor. Anyway, all critiques are welcome and if you can provide experience or data that contradicts my assumptions or highlights important points that I missed then please do.

Bogle himself was a huge proponent of index funds, but many of the qualities I mentioned above can still be captured in funds that don’t follow an index. DFUS as opposed to VTI is one such example if we want to talk about US total market funds. There is evidence that shows that index rebalancing is rather arbitrary and incurs some cost inefficiencies through adverse selection effects, price impacts on index reconstitution, and mean reversion. DFUS essentially delays rebalancing and does it less frequently to avoid arbitrary rebalancing/trading.

VOO,1obz0sw,Bogleheads,Need advice on investments with my advisor,"Hello! Throw away account for anonymity. Sort of a long story but here it goes. I have been saving/investing for about 18 years mainly focusing on my employer's 401k program. About two years ago, I switched jobs and had to decide what to do with my 401k, if anything. I have had a financial advisor pretty much the whole time whom I have been paying a flat fee per year (completely worth it in my case imo). To give a bit of pertinent info, the advisor is also a close friend whom I trust and is a CFP. When asked what shall I do with my 401k, he took his time and was going back and forth whether I should just leave it or roll it into my new job's 401k program. We also discussed opening an IRA with his company (a large and relatively well known wealth management company). He wasn't pushing me either way, just laying out info and options. Although I had been saving and investing, I really didn't know much as far as finances go so I was hoping for guidance on this decision. We ended up opening an IRA with about 80% of the old 401k and put the rest into the 401k with my new job(target date fund). Again, he is a close friend whom I have trusted. He said it would be an actively managed account and he would charge me the lowest fee he could which is 0.5%. I have learned this is actually pretty good as far as AUM fees go (I realize this is highly debatable) but I was comfortable with this as I trust him. Fast forward 2 years later and here we are. I have been really digging deep (at least to me lol) to learn as much as I could about investing and finance. I also have since realized I would like to retire as soon as is feasible, which likely will not be for at least about 10 years, more likely 15. But what I have learned is that it is extremely hard to beat returns on an index fund such as VOO and others. And on top of that, the fees are much better (my 401k has a fee of 0.08%). I know that there are different risk levels and that will determine returns as well. I have always been a moderately aggressive to aggressive investor based on his firm's terminology. The IRA currently is 80% equity, 12.5% fixed income, 5% alternative and 2.5% cash. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples to my 401K to see if I made the right choice as I suspect I may not have. The **401K rate of return is: 17.27% ytd and 15.02% for just the year 2024**. I used these timeframes as the account has only been open about 2 years and when I tried asking for the return rate for 1/1/24-10/19/25 it said 35.2% which didn't seem right. The **IRA rate of return is: 13.38% ytd and 11.98% for 2024**. This is before fees I assume so take off another 0.5% plus fees for the various funds (the portfolio has no less than 25 positions). I would like to stick with him at least as far as the flat fee annual financial planning and guidance goes but I am having second thoughts on the investments. So my questions are: 1. Does this look like a fair comparison? 2. If so, is it a good idea to leave these investments in the IRA? I am not looking forward to the conversation of taking out my funds but I definitely will if I determine it is in the best interest for me and my family.

You can nail the setup, follow every rule, have solid risk management…and then boom. One line on social media wipes out hours of gains or flips your green day red.

VTI,1o24qzy,Bogleheads,All roads lead to VT?,"I internalize the Boglehead way as: Decide on a simple investment allocation in low-cost index funds and stick to/rebalance to that plan yearly regardless of performance because it could take 30+ years for US/Int’l cycles to play out. Stick to things you can control like a high savings rate and avoid the infinite FOMO of chasing market news. That said, VT automatically balances US/Int’l based on market cap. It’s easy to look at the past 10 years of poor performance and underweight International, and therefore go with a heavier US index and underweight international. People DIY’ing an allocation going 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 on VTI/VXUS for example. Isn’t that basically trying to predict the market in its own way, which is contra to the Boglehead philosophy? Again, easy to look at VT the past ten years and see it obviously underperformed VTI. But on a 30 year time horizon, who the heck knows? For transparency: I am on a ~ 30 year time horizon with retirement accounts. Thinking something like 75% VTI and 25% “tinker”, which could be VXUS, VUG, and maybe could contain some a small % of BTC. If I already had a large sum of money I would probably just coast with it in VT, but since I am in accumulation phase the desire is obviously to try to find a higher return. Is anything other than VT effectively gambling by saying “I know better” than the globally weighted index?

VTI,1o4mlb0,Bogleheads,Retiring in three years-which money to move and into what,"I‘m 63, my lovely wife is 56. I plan on retiring in early 2029 and her in 2032. Our plan is to then start taking SS. I currently have 90K in my Roth and 350k in a traditional IRA. I just changed jobs so the money in my 401k is trivial at this point, although I have a net contribution rate of 9% total. I was thinking every quarter until I retire I would transfer money into something less volatile than stocks so we have a cushion of a couple of years in case of a market downturn. I was thinking the some sort of Bond ETF in my traditional IRA. Or should I being doing something else? Here are some more details that I have stated in responses so far: We currently make a bit over 120K a year. We are expecting to collect about 4200/month, 50500 a year in SS when we start collecting in 2032. That amount is indeed assuming a 20% reduction in benefits. Right now we have about $1.2 million retirement funds and about 4 maybe five months of expenses in cash and non retirement funds. We have at about 250k in home equity, 45K left in principal and less than $240 a month in P&I at 3.25%. We don’t see the point of paying off our mortgage early at that rate. 1.5 million in assets should be doable by the time I retire but my lovely wife is still working. At 4% that is 60K a year. So when we both retire and start to collect our income will be pretty much replaced, under these assumptions. Aside from not saving for retirement anymore we will have lower auto expenses. I commute almost 60 a day. If we don’t go to one car there will still be a reduction in costs. When my lovely wife retires our vacation costs will drop because she is in education and we have to go on vacation at peak times. No kids. And we are 100% in stocks right now. A bit of VTI and the rest is S&P500 index funds except for a bit over 100 shares of CCL that we use for shipboard credit on cruises. My timetable is to retire in very early 2029. My lovely wife is aiming to retire in early 2032. We plan on collecting SS when she retires. I hope this helps.

VOO,1nx45ob,stocks,Newish investor - should I worry?,"Was skimming through the CNBC news app and read this fear mongering article (can’t post attachments so will copy paste some parts): - “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday. Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names. Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks: Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner. Many investors assume investing in the S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said. If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur. But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%. Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future. Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback. Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies. Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks. That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k.

The only expenses I have are the day-to-day things like groceries phone bill gas Etc. Also already have emergency fund of about $160,000. I know I'm probably going to catch hell for not having invested some of that already but I've always been risk-averse, but at the same time I know I can't just put that $400,000 in something like a high-yield savings account or bonds especially with rates going down and I don't want to potentially miss out on gains down the road. On the other hand I'm wondering if I should wait until a dip comes to put that money in.

VOO,1o2vqw3,Bogleheads,Semi-beginner investor looking for tips,"Hi all, just turned 33 and trying to get a handle on investing, even if its a bit late. I have a long standing money market and roth ira account with Edward Jones but the more control I have with vanguard and fidelity is appealing. Recently created a roth on fidelity and playing with which etfs to include. currently have about $100 in it, 20% SCHD and QQQI/SPMO/SPYI/VT at 10% each with 40% left in unallocated funds, based on investor youtube videos. My question is twofold. My EJ Roth has a return rate (since inception in 2021) of about 11%. It has averaged 20% per year except for 2022 which was -20%, i assume a covid related crash. Problem is that most portfolios I find in videos average about 7% per year. Much less than the 11% EJ seems to be giving me. Im tempted to switch but if the difference really is that drastic it makes more financial sense to stay with them. Is it normal to have such wide variance with returns, and a much higher average return at that? Second: I am interested in upping my liquid investments as well, but I want to do so in a way that minimizes my taxes. I currently have about 40k with FNILX but thinking about switching to VOO for the portability. Whatever I choose would be more of a net worth vehicle and less focused on income from dividends (though high dividend reinvesting is fine if that would make growth greater).

I put all of my money into SPY and VTI, both of which have nearly doubled in the past 5 years. However, from speaking to my parents, it sounds like their money has not doubled in that timeframe (or anything close to that really). When I mentioned that VTI had nearly 7x'd since 2000, they seemed very surprised. My father mentioned that he has indicated to their manager that he prefers aggressive investments, and that every team he meets with the 'money manager' this person says they're 'beating the baseline'. My first reaction was that this seems negligent on the part of the money manager, or, at the very least that we should consider ditching them and just investing in SPY/VTI. I'm very confused what the 'baseline' could be other than SPY/VTI that they're consistently beating (but still only up 20 or 30% in the past 5 years). Am I missing something?

But isn't that where the growth is, and therefore, decent appreciation for your investments? And if there is a downturn affecting big tech, won't that also impact the U.S. economy as a whole, impacting VTI significantly?

VTI,1o4tr7q,Bogleheads,Do any Bogleheads here actually try to time the market — even just a little — when you see real headwinds coming?,"I've been 100% VTI for awhile now at 39 years old. I know the standard Boglehead philosophy is: *“Stay the course, don’t try to time the market, nobody can do it successfully long-term.”* And I mostly agree. But I’m curious: **Does anyone here shift into bonds or cash when you feel a major downturn is brewing?** Or is that considered heresy? Some specific questions: * Have you ever shifted your asset allocation in advance of a market drop? * If so, what were the **signals** you relied on? Was it technicals, macro data, gut feeling, etc.? * And did it actually work out for you — or backfire? * If not… do you truly believe it’s *impossible* to time anything at all? I’m not talking about day trading or swinging wildly between stocks and bonds every month. I mean more like: >“Hey, valuations are stretched, inflation is rising, the Fed is tightening — maybe I’ll shift 10–20% into bonds or cash just in case.” So I’m opening this up as a **friendly, curious debate** — 👉 Is there *ever* a rational reason to move out of equities temporarily? Or is that a slippery slope to performance-chasing and emotional investing? Would love to hear real stories — wins *and* regrets — from people who’ve tried it. Let’s get nuanced here. Not trying to spark heresy — just thoughtful discussion.

Let's say a person has $25,000 usd in a Roth 401k and that money is in an ETF like VOO. There are no other assets such as real estate, gold or crypto. What is the best way to reduce the impact from a market crash or collapse. Could you change say the ETF like VOO if you think a crash will happen to another stock or asset group that would be less volatile and a crash would not impact it as much? Potentially change to foreign assets or something idk, something that would lessen the impact. I understand markets will go up and down, but is there a way to reduce the impact from a crash? From my understanding the roth 401k could not be changed to assets like gold easily. One could roll the 401k into a self-directed Gold IRA account that allows for gold investment. I don't really know much more than that and seems a bit complicated and you could lose larger gains after the crash potentially.

VTI,1odp96j,Bogleheads,Looking for Insight on Stock Picks and Financial Plan,"Hi. I've been lurking this sub for awhile now, (and read the wiki) and thought I'd check in before I did something that might be completely moronic and screw me over for the next 50 years. I watched a few videos by u/ben_felix (a life saver, by the way) and took [the investment risk tolerance assessment](https://cafnr.missouri.edu/divisions/division-of-applied-social-sciences/research/investment-risk-tolerance-assessment/). (Scored 32, in case that's relevant) Some facts about me: * I'm based in the US * I'm fairly young * I've been in the workforce for 2-3 years now * I have zero debt, a stable income, and a six-month emergency fund in SPAXX * I have a substantial amount of money I can invest *right now this second* * I expect to move up several tax brackets in my lifetime What my plans are: * Max out my Roth 401k contributions up to the $23,500/year limit * Open up and then max out a Roth IRA up to the $7,000/year limit * Create a [Fidelity Basket](https://www.fidelity.com/direct-indexing/customized-investing/overview) with the following mix, based loosely off of a 5-factor portfolio Ben Felix recommended. It will be auto adjusted after either a 5% deviation, or 1 year, whatever happens first, forever. My Roth 401k, Roth IRA, and Brokerage account will all have a duplicate of this portfolio. * `50% VTI (This may be a mix of VOO, FZROX, and/or FNILX depending on the account type)` * `25% VEA` * `10% DFSV` * `10% DFAE` * `5% DISV` So you're probably asking, why not something more simple or less risky? * Equity and small cap seem like good choices in the long run (20-30 years) * Dimensional and Vanguard have good track records and low fees. * I am perfectly fine watching all of this money drop 50-80% in a bear market (or bubble pop). * I don't intend to ever need nor want to touch this money for decades. * If at any point I find myself needing more money, I can just reduce the amount of my paycheck going into the basket to pay for expenses.

QQQ,1nuowqp,Bogleheads,Suggestions Welcomed,"Hello everyone, Long time lurker first time poster (not using my main account). I am a 45F who is trying to make some strategic moves in preparation for potential life changes due to life events, the economy and my desire to get out of the rat race. At this time my financial life looks like this; 65k - Maxing my current employers’ 401k with 10% monthly contributions + 10% match. Additional 6% contribution post tax 5% pretax employee stock purchase program of QQQ about 14k worth for a year. 200k Traditional IRA currently split 30% VT, 10% VXUS, 20% SGOV, 10% IBTI & 10% NVDIA 131k Brokerage with 80% SGOV 20%, 10% VT & 10% VXUS. I plan to DCA 100k into VT in October. 300k in a HYSA at 4.30 Which I am in the process of moving to my brokerage to DCA another 100k into VT and will leave 200k liquid as my emergency fund. I know I am too cash heavy, but I am a single mom with sole custody who won’t be an empty nester for another 3 years and who will have to pay for my daughter’s college (100k already allocated for that and not included above). Right now I am trying to build a plan where I can live off my emergency funds and compound interest should I end up unemployed in 2026. I have reduced my expenses considerably and expect them to be no more than 4k a month in total (mortgage, insurance, utilities, medical co-pays, house maintenance, gas, food, etc). I live and breathe by a budget and am extremely frugal which is the only reason why I have been able to build a safety net, but I want to ensure I can grow through investing so that my hard earned cash yields higher than it has seating on my HYSA while also getting more tax advantages. I say this to say, I don’t want to continue the corporate rat race and given how messed up our economy is, I am trying to have a contingency plan to not have to take on a shitier, less paying job if the tiff comes for me in the spring and actually take the much needed break my very burnt out brain needs. Having said the above I would like your opinions on my plan to maintain 230k cash on hand in SGOV (instead of the HYSA) to draw from if I get riffed. I calculated that if I need 4k a month starting the spring of 2026 and yields stay at current rate, that’s about 6 years and if they go down to let’s say 3% that’s about 6 years if I add unemployment and severance. In 5 years I would be an empty nester and will like to move out of the country where I could live on 1k a month and basically cruise until I can use the rule of 55 to start cashing in on my portfolio. I know you all don’t have a crystal ball and no one knows what will happen to the market in the future but I am basically trying to not lose 50% of my liquid as I am burned out from working my whole life to raise my kids on my own and want to protect myself against a potential 30-50% downturn in the event I lose my job (tech sector) in the next year. I am a high performer and am not currently at risk but my org is weird and they recently riffed my boss who was an amazing professional and leader so I am wary and don’t want to find myself unemployed and burning through my reserves without a plan. God willing and I am able to stay, my plan is to up my 6% post tax contribution to 10% and add it to my brokerage in form of DCA into VT/VXUS. Let me have your thoughts and please be gentle, I am not as well informed as most of you and was only able to start making meaningful contributions to my retirement and brokerage the past two years.",2,4,2025-09-30 20:52:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nuowqp/suggestions_welcomed/,2025-10-23 09:16:33.958332,0.4,$QQQ,0.5,[],['split'],0.6057142857142856

I do have the option of VTI and VXUS (which I have some in) but I am also diversified in several other ETFs. Is this ok? Any reason to change again? Is there a penalty? https://preview.redd.it/xyiagi08losf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73d6e2dfc249756eedbdd40d47c7b6899a97736,3,5,2025-10-02 11:08:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nw0sk0/hsa_portfolio_question/,2025-10-23 09:12:15.476381,0.4,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.6

VOO,1ocq8u8,investing,How do you feel about self-directed retirement plan through employer-sponsored 457/401?,"I currently have a retirement plan through my employer where about 40% of my funds are self-directed vs picking different options through my plan administrator. I chose to move those funds, to a self-directed broker; it is not automatic. My knowledge of investing is fairly limited and high level as I just haven't had the time to really learn about investing. I do not even know if the statement I made above makes any sense. Most of my self-directed funds are in ETFs. It was explained to me that going this route has lesser fees than if I were to go through a plan offered by my administrator. I do have investments in individual stocks as well (using my retirement plan) Part of me is getting nervous about the stock market in general but I can't explain why since my understanding is surface level. My self-directed portion has been pretty successful so far but so has the rest of my retirement that's manages through administrator. I'm turning 40 next year so I have plenty of time left in my career. Knowing me, I am not at the point where I am able to make really educated decisions on what ETFs or stocks to invest in. Should I reallocate all my funds into the self-directed brokerage account and invest into different ETFs? Should I move my funds that are in individual stocks into ETFs? Or should I just stay the course?
