VOO,1oaxxe9,Bogleheads,If i make enough money investing in VOO through a brokerage account over time to retire early or realize some of the gains; as long as I dont make over 47K taxable income said year then hypothetically wouldn’t it be tax free to withdraw gains (aside from state tax)?,(Trying to decide between accounts just want to make sure I understand) And if so is it still beneficial to go with roth ira over a brokerage account if im still fairy young and able to invest a decent chunk of my weekly paychecks into VOO and should have a pretty sizable amount well before the age of 60 with the compound interest accrued? Is the only drawback the 5% state income tax id have to pay on dividends and gains? And do you guys think that alone is reason enough to not be able to have access to life changing money until im 60 (35+ years)? Especially when u can borrow against a brokerage too.,64,31,2025-10-19 18:59:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oaxxe9/if_i_make_enough_money_investing_in_voo_through_a/,2025-11-07 16:46:17.393053,1.0,$VOO,0.5,[],['dividend'],1.0,Broad Market ETF

SPY,1ogonw5,investing,Help me understand why I shouldn't sell my long term rental and just sell covered calls on SPY,"\*\*reposting here since it was deleted from r/realestateinvesting Have had a rental home operating for a little under 10 years. It is a 2 bed/1bath at 1200 square feet in what I would call a B- neighborhood. The home had a 15 year mortgage taken out in 2012 and has about $15k in principle left. Rental income is currently at $1495/month. averaging the various online real estate sites and looking at recent sales I'd estimate the current sales value at around $225k. The roof, HVAC, and fence are all less than 5 years old, so if we do continue to rent, we should be clear of any large CAPEX items for several years. When we pay off the home in 2027, assuming we are still at $1495 per month, after taxes and insurance it comes out to $977 (again, assuming T&I doesnt keep rising at a ridiculous rate). Accounting for management, vacancy, repairs and future CAPEX I am calculating around $560 per month. Assuming 2% annual appreciation, that adds another $375/month (first year) for a total of $960/month. If I were to sell the home today at the $225k, after realtor fees, depreciation recapture, taxes, mortgage pay off, capital gains, minor repairs etc, I am coming up with around $175k in cash. Now for my theory: say I take this $175k and add some savings to get to $203k so I can buy 300 shares of SPY at its current trading price of $677. Tracking this for a bit, I can sell 0.25 delta covered calls that are one week out for around $1.75 each. This would put the gross income at $525/week, not accounting for any appreciation. I don't need to show the math to prove that this comes out to higher than the $960/month from my rental. two outcomes of this weekly position: 1. SPY increases past my strike. I roll the option into the following week, profit is locked up in the sell/buy but still a net increase. 2. SPY trades below my strike by whatever amount and I just keep the premium. There are of course pros and cons to both options. An obvious risk to point out with the CC option is that the market could plummet at any point and my $200k could fall to $100k or lower. If, in theory, I do not plan to cash out this position and spend it anytime within the next couple decades (similar to holding the cash in the rental equity) I'm not concerned over that other than the income from the premiums would shrink as well. There are also obvious cons to the rental that are not captured in the $960 above as well. A bad tenant, liability, extended vacancy, reduction in rent (probably tied to the market 'crash' scenario above) all could impact the profitability. I have also looked into selling this property or pulling a HELOC to buy other rentals. At the current values and interest rates I just can't get any properties I come across to make sense at all. I am open to other suggestions or pointing out of pitfalls or other details I am not considering.

VOO,1o7k4f0,investing,I bought QQQ in November of 2023. It has doubles since then: sell or hold???,"Context: I'm 45. AI will probably make my job obsolete in the next 5-10 years. I didn't rise above poverty until 2017. I make a modest income but it's not poverty anymore. I've only been saving and investing since then. I have ROTH IRA. I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job. I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years. I've thought that maybe I could sell the gains and put it in a safer investment, just play with the house's money. Or sell ALL of it, maybe I'm overexposed to the S & P 500. If you're bored at work, tell me what you would do. I want to hear some opinions to get my analyzing process flowing. EDIT: I misspoke, I actually invested in November 2022! Not 2023 as the subject line of this post says. So as of today its a 117% gain. I loved reading all the responses. I think I'm going to hold it all and let it ride. I'm pretty conservative in most other investments, my Roth IRA is managed by Fidelity, a boring mix of bonds and diversified stocks, but it helps me sleep at night. It feels right to have an all-in big swing as well. Through a little risk and a lot of luck I successfully timed the market on the fastest growing industry.

SPY,1o48yf4,Bogleheads,"Short, medium, and long term after a crash","I looked into what happened after the 2008 crash. I am just using SPY (S&P 500) and VDC (consumer staples) as examples here: you could use VTI or VT for broad market indexes and there are other ""stable"" sectors, like utilities, that this analysis should still hold true for. While both SPY and VDC fell in the crash, VDC fell less. While both recovered after the crash, VDC recovered a year and a half earlier. And while the S&P 500 has by far the better long term performance it took SPY well over a decade to catch back up to VDC. Bonds of course fell by less, holding their value better in the three years after the crash. VDC caught back up to BND in fall 2012, SPY caught back up to BND a year later. So there's three time ranges: - short term BND preserved spending power during and immediately - VDC recovered faster and provided better growth over the next ten years - long term S&P 500 dominates Therefore I'm thinking of allocating something like this: 40% VTI (VT if you want int'l) 30% VDC and similar 30% BND and similar (TIPS, bills) I think this might be better than 60/40 because it uses VDC to better fund the decade after a crash, and although VDC is slower growing, overall 70% equities is still pretty aggressive.

SPY,1ompeqi,Bogleheads,Are tech ETFs in a massive bubble?,"I recently had a thought that A.I stocks are pretty risky, which is pretty logical. There is nothing inherently wrong with taking risk, but it's important to understand what stocks carry exactly what type of risk. I also thought that in-general people consider ETFs safe. Yet an ETF like SPY is now majorly reliant on A.I companies. Yet people consider SPY safe. Is that not an oxymoron? Is there not some faulty logic involved in assuming ETFs are safe? Everyone and their mother is just dumping money into ETFs these days expecting them to be safe, because they are ""diversified"", are we not making a big fucking mistake? ETFs only became popular after GFC in 2008, SPY was only created in 1993. How do you even properly assess the risk of an ETF such as the SPY if it only gained major volume post-GFC? We haven't had a major bubble since the GFC to even test the resilience of ETFs in the first place! I understand how ETFs work, I understand that the SPY simply tracks the largest top 500 companies in the U.S. Again, I don't consider there to be anything inherently wrong with taking risk, A.I would be a massive play if it makes advancements that everyone is hoping there will be. NVIDIA's earning would definitely balloon like crazy if another A.I jump happens. But the elephant in the room that I am seeing right now is that tech ETFs are *APPARENTLY* considered safe investments, safe enough for people to dump their retirements into, people who are ignoring the wisdom of having at least some buffer of bonds for the bad times, and that's worrying me about the market risks. TL;DR: A.I isn't the bubble, A.I is just a risky tech play, if it succeeds the upside is enormous. The risk assessment of A.I is correct in my opinion. But ETFs that have exposure to A.I don't seem to have the proper risk assessment.

Do I just invest in more VOO or do invest in a different ETF, go Dividend heavy, or something else all together? I feel like VOO would be ok but that doesn't give us much diversity in our portfolio.

VOO,1oivsbo,Bogleheads,Is the Acorns aggressive portfolio boglehead-friendly?,"Brief context: I got into investing earlier this year through Acorns, set my portfolio to aggressive (no bonds), and gradually DCA'd over the year. I'm now looking for a long-term platform for larger investments and weighing Vanguard Digital Advisor vs Vanguard DIY vs Acorns vs Wealthfront. I'm specifically curious about the difference between Vanguard Digital Advisor and Acorns. Based on everything I've read, VDA's portfolio is essentially VTI + VXUS. My Acorns is VOO + IJH (mid cap) + IJR (small cap) + IXUS, which feels very similar, just with VTI broken down into large / mid / small cap. |Vanguard Digital Advisor|Acorns| |:-|:-| |VTI|VOO (big cap)| ||IJH (mid cap)| ||IJR (small cap)| |VXUS|IXUS| Among the options I'm considering, Wealthfront at least has some unique points of differentiation like the HYSA and tax loss harvesting. And Vanguard DIY probably has the most flexibility if I want to tinker in future. # But is picking VDA essentially the same as continuing with Acorns and avoiding the hassle of opening a new account? A lot of my research suggests that Acorns is for micro investing and beginners. And Vanguard or Wealthfront are for more serious, longer-term wealth building.

VOO,1ob3vv7,Bogleheads,Asset Location Question,"We all know that the sequence is: HSA ($4400/year, $366/month) Roth IRA ($7500/year, $625/month) Trad 401k ($24500/year, 2042/month) Taxable (no limits) HSA+Roth IRA+401k Total ($36400/year, $3033/month) Yes, I know 401k up to match comes ahead, but for this discussion, it won't matter because we can max them all, and then some. If I have all these accounts available to me, and my desired asset allocation is: 60% VOO (S&P500) 30% VXUS (ex-US) 10% AVUV (US Small Value) Let's pretend I can invest $10k/month (I wish, hypothetical) What is the most tax-efficient way to spread the $10k/month? Without doing much reseach, from the top of my head, I know: VOO is tax-efficient so put it in Taxable AVUV is expected to grow the most so put it in Roth IRA VXUS in Taxable for Foreign Tax Credit I feel like the most tax-efficient way will have a little bit of this here, a little bit of that there. Then it gets complex. So I think, doing simply this: 60% VOO (S&P500) or it's equivalent 30% VXUS (ex-US) or it's equivalent 10% AVUV (US Small Value) or it's equivalent In your HSA, In your Roth IRA, In your 401k (if available) Treat each bucket as its own instead of treat all your buckets as one is the simplest thing to do despite being not the most tax efficient.

QQQ,1o8rou6,investing,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"\[Cross-posted to r/ETFs\] I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun... I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors. Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23. **TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.** **Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more? I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots. source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp) **Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision: Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold Todd J. Barre: For Brian Hartigan: For Victoria J. Herget: For Marc M. Kole: Withhold Yung Bong Lim: For Joanne Pace: For Gary R. Wicker: For Donald H. Wilson: Against **Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs. *Invesco, do better by your shareholders if you're going to be mailing and calling me EVERY.

SPY,1ocdk6m,wallstreetbets,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard. The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution. You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a >20% drop the next week. **The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:** A wise man once told me history is a flat circle. Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/). The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total). [Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a) Now, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls. If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26 GLD 500C option (the farthest OTM currently available) at the current price of 2.14 (market close 20OCT25): **Scenario 1 (1979-1980 Repeat) - GLD doubles to 800 by end of year: Option has $300 of intrinsic value; 14,300% return** **Scenario 2 (Partial Repeat) - GLD increases 50% to 600 by end of year: Option has $100 of intrinsic value; 4,760% return** **Scenario 3 (Continuing trend) - GLD increases 25% to 500 by end of the year: Option has estimated $10 of extrinsic value 2 weeks from expiration; 476% return** **Scenario 4: GLD doesn't increase that much: -100% return** Now, I spy the glint of gold in many of your eyes. But others are muttering among yourselves, “Yet another meme stock. Last time I played one of those, my wife's boyfriend grounded me for a week.“ But here is why gold is uniquely positioned for such a move: gold is a physical object that has served as a trusted store of value for literally all of recorded history. I'll bet almost everyone here has at least one grandparent who hoards precious metals like a geriatric dragon. As a result, many poor souls who've never even heard of meme stocks will plunge into this frothing storm without knowing the perils of speculative markets They don't need charts or a brokerage to buy gold; they just go to their nearest Coin and Jewellery store with their Wendy's paycheck. A second factor today is the sheer access to leverage that did not exist in the 1979's-1980s. Back then, no ETFs even existed. No GLD, no SLV, nothing. And you had to call your broker to place a trade. But today, any room-temperature IQ degenerate can YOLO their entire net worth into 0dte calls on margin at the touch of a button. We just live in an era of rapid and rampant speculation. So now, let me give you a little background on the state of gold in general. If your bored, you can just skip ahead to my positions and exit strategy. **Gold Distribution:** Across the world, there is only 216,000 tons of gold in circulation as of the end of 2024. Approximately half is held as jewelry which includes 34,600 tons and 31,000 tons held by Indian and Chinese households, respectively. Another 38,000 tons is held by central banks. 49,000 tons are held as bars and coins (including ETFs) and finally, 32,000 tons in other uses (industrial, etc). [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/data\/how-much-gold](https://preview.redd.it/ycdnsoy4zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8bd50ba2171b41e63e368d5b37bccdfa127bee) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-kw2lzyo7rgwf1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bca613ec3fec7508590af3de870a76c6f4ba61d) Gold Supply: In 2024, 3660 tons of gold was mined which is roughly 1.7% of the total supply. While mining efforts are likely ramping up, this should not impact supply that much over the duration of our voyage. [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/research\/gold-demand-trends\/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024](https://preview.redd.it/rv3h9wq6zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4135b0c31f240f3bc13cfb6e5ffdec5b37e7e6) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-v0te84o9rgwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bed6835419fbf38ed1d44e180b263493cd0c18d) A greater risk for supply is for people to start selling their gold bullion or jewellery to take advantage of the high prices which is listed as Recycled Gold in the chart above. During 2024, this accounted for 1370 tons, but this will undoubtedly increase as the price of gold increases. In accounts of the 1979-1980 mania, there were suddenly many gold and silver buyers popping up near the end; the modern equivalent would be getting spam texts asking you to sell your silver and gold (like you get for houses currently). This will be a sign the end is near. I will also be monitoring headlines for news of mass retail selling of gold and silver, especially in places like India and China where the population owns a tremendous amount of gold.

The US has been unable to get spending under control and continues to spend like a drunken pirate on shore. While the US is highly unlikely to actually default, the government will print to meet debt requirements, devaluing the currency. If you knew that you would be taking an inflationary haircut on any of your treasury holdings, would you really keep as many? https://preview.redd.it/teqt2yrfzgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=605469cc135657a8d1d1e2fe6e2ee445b0180320 Another common talking point driving gold prices is that Central banks are buying lots of gold and several countries, notably Turkey, have laws which gives the central bank the right to buy any gold produced in the country at market prices. Overall, Central Banks bought over 1000 tons of gold in 2023 and 2024. Gold has increased to over 20% of all central bank holdings while US treasuries have fallen.

This currency would serve as replacement for the US Dollar for trade in a scenario where another hegemonic power did not arise. **Position and Sizing:** As an established pirate, my chest of booty has well over a million doubloons from plundering the land o’ Kohls.

VOO,1ojds0c,Bogleheads,Why do people recommend balanced ETFs/portfolios over equity ETFs?,"Recently a couple of people I consider to be very knowledgeable investors told me that it is important to have a balanced portfolio (recommending 60% equities and 40% bonds). I have also read articles saying this. (I have about a 75% equities (50% US, 25% non-US, vs. 25% bonds/cash portfolio and my networth recently began to exceed the target I set for retirement.) I'm hopefully about 2 years from early retirement and have a cash cushion and Treasury Direct inflation protected bonds that will mature in the next 2-8 years. From the cash cushion and the bonds, I could currently comfortably live for 3-4 years. If I followed the advice, rather than constantly rebalancing a portfolio, it seems to me that it would be easier and more reliable to buy a balanced fund, which should achieve the same end. The knowledgeable investors tell me that over time these balanced funds will do better than equity ETFs. I wanted to test this, so using a web based tool, [Stoculator](https://stoculator.com/), for seeing the historical price of stocks/ETFs, for different time periods for balanced funds (VWELX (US), VGWLX (Global), VTTHX (Balanced Target 2035, which I own)) and equity funds (VOO/SPY (S&P 500, which I own), VTI (US, which I own), VT (Global)). Here is what I found: https://preview.redd.it/oulqrpdaf3yf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=798a3108adddb0fd91a6d01c1c9b87dd7f882d18 (The start dates are generally based on around the time a fund started trading. N/A means that a fund didn't exist at that date or that I could not get data from Stoculator. **I used SPY for my earliest calculations because it existed before VOO and both track the S&P 500.** For the calculation, all dividends were reinvested.) This is by no means a rigorous comparison but what I'm finding is that over time pure equity funds do much better than balanced funds. While balanced funds don't drop as much during a correction/crash, in all the instances, I saw, they still drop significantly. Here is one more example, a $10K investment in SPY 11/13/2000 with dividends reinvested would today be worth $57,548, whereas an investment $10K in VBIAX on the same day would yield $36,548. (I chose the date based VBIAX's IPO date. VBIAX is a 40% US bond, 60% US equities balanced fund). Even if we assume that a crash reduced the investment in SPY by 50% and the investment in VBIAX by 20%, you're still doing better with SPY. For me a cash cushion of about 5 years of comfortable living would consist of 20% of my total assets. (A cash cushion would consist of a mix of funds in money markets, CDs and bond ladders.) Based on this, I think that the optimal strategy for would be to have about 80% in equities and 20% as a cash cushion. This assumes that a big crash would take about 5 years to recover. Although a balanced fund would possibly recover faster, recovery would be to a much lower level. Are my calculations and/or my thinking incorrect? Why do experienced investors say that an asset allocation between stocks and bonds should be the same regardless of how much you have vs. expenses? Why do experienced investors often say that bond funds or balanced funds are a hedge against market downturns when frequently both bond funds and equities go down in tandem? To me it seems that a hedge should go in the opposite direction of whatever is being hedged. Are my time ranges too short? (The longest I have is \~33 years.) Also, generally interest from bonds is taxed at a higher rate than income from capital gains in stocks. Doesn't that mean that you will often pay more taxes on balanced funds? (This could vary a lot.)

QQQ,1ok1ccd,stocks,Shorting Coverd Call ETFs and buying the underlying,"Hello Everyone, I have recently been thinking about a strategy i have never heard someone else talk about before and would like some serious feedback on this one. Most Coverd Call ETFs simply sell ATM Calls with 1 Month until expirarion. This caps there upside for premium and creates long term drag against the underlying. Thus a coverd call ETF will in the long run basically always underperfom the underlying. My idea: After a major market crash, implied volatility spikes and these ETFs sell very rich calls struck near the new, lower price level. If the market then stabilizes or recovers, they severely underperform because their upside is capped for months while vol collapses. The Trade: Wait until after a sharp drawdown (say, −25–30 % and VIX > 35). Short a covered-call ETF, for Example QYLD Then go long on the underlying, like QQQ Borrow cost would be around 1–2 % p.a., and I’d owe the monthly distributions. So as Volatility mean-reverts and the market rebounds, the covered-call ETF lags badly, thus generating excess return on my long position. What do you guys think about this? I know there is no free money and im screwed if the underlying just continues to fall further, but i really think this is a sound idea.

SPY,1onk7x3,wallstreetbets,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here: You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies. People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations. This brings us to Google, one of the most oversold stocks in the entire market (until very recently). After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89. Let me repeat that for you: One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than: -Walmart -Caterpillar -Costco -Nike -Hilton -Pepsi Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative. The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses. And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time). The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble. it’s arguably the other way around.

VOO,1oapx46,Bogleheads,VT and chill...right?,"Hi all, thanks for stopping by my post. I've been lurking this sub for a while and I never really had the money to make significant investments, but my situation changed and I want to set myself up for the future. I'm 24M living at home with my parents, no expenses besides gas/insurance, leisure, and additional food outside of what's cooked for dinner. I got hired at the post office so I left my old job, and was recently able to over my old employee sponsored 401k plan into a Roth IRA (my reasoning being that I'm in a low tax bracket and I'd know exactly how much I could pull out once the time comes). I don't come from much financial knowledge or success, I grew up and still live in a HCOL area (Long Island, NY) and I've seen what my parents have had to do to keep food on the table and while I greatly appreciate it, I don't want to put myself through the same type of stress. My first question is: What should I invest my IRA holdings in for the most amount of growth over the long term? From what I've learned, I'm assuming I can just buy all VT just to set it and forget it for a while as i continue to contribute, then down the line diversify my contributions for more stability. My goal is to retire as early as possible, and the fastest way to do that seems to be getting your money to work for you as much as possible. Since starting my new job, I cleared all my credit card debt and have a plan to pay off my student loans by the end of 2026. After that I don't have any debt and don't plan to incur any until I can start considering buying a house hopefully in the next 10 years. I buy my cars off Marketplace in cash so no worries about payments, pay my insurance policy in full so that it's a one time expense, and I've been adjusting my lifestyle to significantly cut down on leisurely spending and focus on investing in my future. My Roth has about $9k after the rollover, but most of it has been sitting uninvested the last couple days due to me not wanting to make a costly wrong decision or accidentally set myself back. Outside of my IRAs I've bought $1k in both VOO and VTI so that I'd at least be making something while I mull over the decision, any and all advice is greatly appreciated so thank you guys in advance!",24,18,2025-10-19 13:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oapx46/vt_and_chillright/,2025-11-07 16:46:17.393581,0.5,$VOO,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999,Broad Market ETF

VOO,1opzwwx,investing,A portal to the Boglehead Universe,"My dearest investing redditors, please join me on this thought experiment where we travel to the Boglehead Universe. I'm not inviting you all to sell your individual stocks and dump it all into ETFs, although that arguable is the best thing that most of us can do. No, I am going to use your brain and imagination to teleport us to another reality where every single dollar that gets invested goes only into Bogle-approved vehicles. Most money in the world ends up in the SP500, NASDAQ, and DOW. For more risk-averse (although what is risk in this world?), there are bond-indexed funds, gold and silver funds, and so on. Lets be a little more precise. Sector-specific ETFs are only marginally reasonable from a Bogle perspective. Probably people don't hold these, but I'm not sure. How do we get to this place? Who knows. Maybe there is an alien messiah that arrives on a well-funded spaceship to show us the errors of our non-Bogling ways. Possibly the next strongman leader of America passes an EO that forbids all other investments because he ran on the MABA (Make America Bogle Again) platform. Or it could have been last week's tic-tok from Jack Schmucko that really had an impact on retail investors and hedge fund managers alike. How do things like liquidity work? Not my problem. So starting tomorrow at market open, everyone has this mass realization and dumps all of their non-Bogle holdings and pumps them into the closest approved vehicle. Overnight, the value of the SP500 and all contained stocks blow up. Meanwhile, the value of smaller companies not included in that index vanishes. A lot of people lose money here, but they are being irrationally rational. From this day forward, every dollar that someone makes but doesn't need for food, goes straight into index funds. Equities that are heavily weighted in index funds continue to grow proportional to their weight (can I get a fact check please?). Company valuations all move in lockstep with the markets (i.e. however quickly people invest their paychecks). Investors have stopped looking at fundamentals, as Bogleheads by definition are cost-insensitive. It doesn't matter how much a share of VOO is. You just DCA every day. \----------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, clearly we don't quite live in Boglehead Universe, but it seems to me that there is a point at which Bogleheads en masse will distort the markets. 401K holders do much the same, pouring money in without any concern; over the past 20-ish years we have used behavioral economics to nudge individuals (that would otherwise not have invested) to contribute consistent % of income. Much to their personal benefit, of course. The potential risk that I see in this is that a Bogle mindset will tend to pump up the valuations of already high value assets (due to weighting in index funds). Also, over the past 10-15-20 years, we have been in a relatively continuous bull run, but how much of that is growth of the economy and the fundamentals, and how much is it simply pulling in assets from the proletariat as they have been trained to contribute to 401k and now can more easily invest directly on platforms like Robin Hood and Fidelity. The past decades have seen the markets pick up ""wealth"" market share, from all the people who used to put their money into cigarettes or mattresses. At some point, as with all growth, that acceleration will cut out and the market should again be tied directly to overall economic growth. Ultimately I see this as continuing to pump up the Mag 7. I'd hesitate to call it a bubble. As long as we all believe in the Bogle philosophy, we will all be making great returns. But I do question if the valuations have any relation to reality and fundamentals.",0,17,2025-11-06 14:09:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1opzwwx/a_portal_to_the_boglehead_universe/,2025-11-07 16:46:02.288441,0.5,$VOO,0.8,[],['bull'],0.7057142857142856,Broad Market ETF

I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey).

I'm sure like 5 people remember my last post from a year ago where I broke down my entire strategy. I won't be doing that again, but here's an update on how it performed. Overall up +32% which is slightly better than QQQ's +29%. I didn't even come close to TQQQ's +63% this time around and the cause is pretty clear... XLP flopped big time. I know it's a hedge so in a way it's supposed to underperform when everything is at all time highs but to underperform THIS much? It felt like I was hedging my calls with puts. I could speculate that there's some global macroeconomic shift away from consumer staples or something but I didn't get here by doing that kind of DD. I just backtested historical returns. https://preview.redd.it/8oih97uutgyf1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e35321eff36d599934739ea8de4f8d9c0227c1 On an unrelated note, I find it hilarious that some haters bookmarked my post and showed up to say ""told you so"" around liberation day. Yeah I was down -$167k at the time but I've seen worse and that ended up being a nothing burger. Turns out when your calls have 1-2 years until expiry those temporary setbacks don't matter much. Moving forward, I think I'm done with options. I'm sure we've all seen those posts where people hit it big and make life changing money but don't know when to quit. There's this dismissive attitude like ""if you can't quit your day job right this instant then it's not enough money"" but that's just not true. All time (since 2018) I'm up +$415k which is a massive head start and is plenty to snowball into retirement from here even in shares. Maybe if my goal were to hit a high score of millions of dollars I'd keep YOLOing 50% of my portfolio into LEAPS every year but I just want a comfy normal life. https://preview.redd.it/q6lgexe0vgyf1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b663478b678b636f52228f06b7ccf47cce7e70 If you backtest retirement strategies (which I've done a lot of) the ones that fail happen when you hit your target number due to some bubble, quit your job, then immediately stuff crashes back down like in 2000 or 2008.

SPY,1oqyx1w,stocks,The market was vulnerable indeed. At a crossroads now.,"A little over week ago [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuturesTrading/comments/1ok88pn/is_the_market_vulnerable_here/) on Reddit that the market looked fragile due to the potent combination of breadth deterioration, MAGS-led complacency, TA vulnerabilities, and a climbing VVIX/VIX ratio, among other things. In line with recent times when we’ve seen this combination, the S&P futures have now pulled back over 3%. Downside setups were strong. So where do we stand now and how may this help evaluate what comes next? * The percentage of stocks above the 50-day MA has dropped a further 11% as compared to \~25% deterioration in the four-day period noted last week. So while we’ve seen some slowdown in that regard, the overall trajectory is clearly down and at levels on par with what we saw in April. * MAGS led index prices to new all-time highs this past week, but without the rally broadening out, the indices were super vulnerable. This week though, there is some welcome relief as the rising S&P equal weight : SPY ratio indicates broadening participation and improving market structure. * Last week I noted that the rising VVIX/VIX was our early sign that risk was ahead, though masked by headline index prices. As the VIX pushed over 21 today, we’ve not seen VVIX rise as fast and so this ratio has fallen substantially. * That decline indicates volatility demand is normalizing, suggesting the market is absorbing the shock rather than escalating it. * In fact, this ratio is now back to where it was in mid-October, when the S&P 500 futures (and index/SPY) tested the trend channel which developed coming out of April weakness. Prices are there again now, again testing the 50-day moving average and hovering just above the cloud model. Unfilled gaps created on the way up, a sign of weak structure, have now been filled (while a new one was created today). * While on the topic of technicals, the RUT double top was prescient, leading to a 6% pullback. * Elsewhere in the credit markets, short-term treasuries are outperforming high yield corporate bonds. That’s consistent with risk-off rotation but not yet systemic stress, since spreads are widening in an orderly fashion. * This leaves markets at a critical juncture and not nearly as clear as last week’s reading. Three technical things to watch will be: 1) Ability to recover the 50-day, 2) Reaction at cloud model, 3) Ability to recover primary trend. A bonus is how we see stochastics, pictured below, react at oversold levels. Recovering these levels would suggest the pullback was corrective instead of the start of something major. * At the portfolio level, I kept my anchor stocks (NVDA, AAPL, AMZN etc) but sold all speculative stocks and increased portfolio cash to about 53%. I'll wait until the above resolves until I increase positioning to 90% or more. * Seasonally, the market performs well November to year-end, though it's too early to count on that. https://preview.redd.it/95tfrknr2vzf1.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e53803e0c44f2350579d8f7d0549cd7eb9f908f",5,2,2025-11-07 16:25:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oqyx1w/the_market_was_vulnerable_indeed_at_a_crossroads/,2025-11-07 16:47:36.384092,0.45,$SPY,0.9,[],['rally'],0.7057142857142856,Broad Market ETF

VOO,1obz0sw,Bogleheads,Need advice on investments with my advisor,"Hello! Throw away account for anonymity. Sort of a long story but here it goes. I have been saving/investing for about 18 years mainly focusing on my employer's 401k program. About two years ago, I switched jobs and had to decide what to do with my 401k, if anything. I have had a financial advisor pretty much the whole time whom I have been paying a flat fee per year (completely worth it in my case imo). To give a bit of pertinent info, the advisor is also a close friend whom I trust and is a CFP. When asked what shall I do with my 401k, he took his time and was going back and forth whether I should just leave it or roll it into my new job's 401k program. We also discussed opening an IRA with his company (a large and relatively well known wealth management company). He wasn't pushing me either way, just laying out info and options. Although I had been saving and investing, I really didn't know much as far as finances go so I was hoping for guidance on this decision. We ended up opening an IRA with about 80% of the old 401k and put the rest into the 401k with my new job(target date fund). Again, he is a close friend whom I have trusted. He said it would be an actively managed account and he would charge me the lowest fee he could which is 0.5%. I have learned this is actually pretty good as far as AUM fees go (I realize this is highly debatable) but I was comfortable with this as I trust him. Fast forward 2 years later and here we are. I have been really digging deep (at least to me lol) to learn as much as I could about investing and finance. I also have since realized I would like to retire as soon as is feasible, which likely will not be for at least about 10 years, more likely 15. But what I have learned is that it is extremely hard to beat returns on an index fund such as VOO and others. And on top of that, the fees are much better (my 401k has a fee of 0.08%). I know that there are different risk levels and that will determine returns as well. I have always been a moderately aggressive to aggressive investor based on his firm's terminology. The IRA currently is 80% equity, 12.5% fixed income, 5% alternative and 2.5% cash. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples to my 401K to see if I made the right choice as I suspect I may not have. The **401K rate of return is: 17.27% ytd and 15.02% for just the year 2024**. I used these timeframes as the account has only been open about 2 years and when I tried asking for the return rate for 1/1/24-10/19/25 it said 35.2% which didn't seem right. The **IRA rate of return is: 13.38% ytd and 11.98% for 2024**. This is before fees I assume so take off another 0.5% plus fees for the various funds (the portfolio has no less than 25 positions). I would like to stick with him at least as far as the flat fee annual financial planning and guidance goes but I am having second thoughts on the investments. So my questions are: 1. Does this look like a fair comparison? 2. If so, is it a good idea to leave these investments in the IRA? I am not looking forward to the conversation of taking out my funds but I definitely will if I determine it is in the best interest for me and my family.

I opened a HYSA with Sofi and depositing 1k into the savings account every paycheck, and I plan on maximizing my Roth IRA on the 2nd of every January. Currently, I'm trying to solve a problem of consolidating all my retirement plans from all my employers. I have two accounts (4 accounts in total) in both Vanguard and Fidelity. Fidelity: $9,286.88 in a Simple IRA with positions FBALX and FSANX $16,758.33 in a Fidelity Freedom 2050 K6 (FZTKX) Vanguard: $4,025.68 in a Roth IRA with VFFVX $12,419.84 in a 401(k) Target Retire 2055 Trust I still need to hunt down a few other employers, but I have another 401(k) with my current employer and about $6,000 in a 403(b) from my previous employer. At least for the Fidelity and Vanguard accounts, what would you rollover and which ones would you keep? I would like to keep things simple, and I don't mind paying rollover fees. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Update 10/27/2025 Thanks everyone. I ended up keeping both Vanguard and Fidelity. I have a rollover IRA and a Roth IRA in both brokerage firms. The rollover IRAs will stay there with pre-tax dollars for current and future 401(k) accounts even though the backdoor method was mentioned to put the funds into the Roth IRAs. I like having the flexibility of a Roth IRA in both brokerage firms to change funds for performance chasing and diversity. All the amounts in Vanguard investment were changed to VGT. I will keep an eye on the market and switch to VOO if the IT sector becomes too risky. I would like to say that Fidelity's customer service was definitely better. I do like that that switching between Fidelity funds is easy. Vanguard wanted to charge me $25 dollars to switch funds and didn't mention any benefit to staying with Vanguard funds within Vanguard. Anyways, the amounts in Fidelity were split 50/50 into two funds: FSPSX and FMDGX. I like the growth and diversification of my choices. I will decide how I will be contributing the $7,000 at the beginning of every year between all 3 funds, but I am keeping an eye on opportunities within the small caps market. My current employer's 401(k) portal is simple to use, and I can quickly increase contributions towards the end of the year. I didn't have a lot of investment options for my 401(k), but I did change it to FXAIX.

VOO,1o1tlzd,Bogleheads,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability. But that aside, why would someone choose broad based funds like VTI or VOO over more focused options like SP100 or SCHG? Edit: Thanks everyone!

I know I'm probably going to catch hell for not having invested some of that already but I've always been risk-averse, but at the same time I know I can't just put that $400,000 in something like a high-yield savings account or bonds especially with rates going down and I don't want to potentially miss out on gains down the road. On the other hand I'm wondering if I should wait until a dip comes to put that money in.

VOO,1o2vqw3,Bogleheads,Semi-beginner investor looking for tips,"Hi all, just turned 33 and trying to get a handle on investing, even if its a bit late. I have a long standing money market and roth ira account with Edward Jones but the more control I have with vanguard and fidelity is appealing. Recently created a roth on fidelity and playing with which etfs to include. currently have about $100 in it, 20% SCHD and QQQI/SPMO/SPYI/VT at 10% each with 40% left in unallocated funds, based on investor youtube videos. My question is twofold. My EJ Roth has a return rate (since inception in 2021) of about 11%. It has averaged 20% per year except for 2022 which was -20%, i assume a covid related crash. Problem is that most portfolios I find in videos average about 7% per year. Much less than the 11% EJ seems to be giving me. Im tempted to switch but if the difference really is that drastic it makes more financial sense to stay with them. Is it normal to have such wide variance with returns, and a much higher average return at that? Second: I am interested in upping my liquid investments as well, but I want to do so in a way that minimizes my taxes. I currently have about 40k with FNILX but thinking about switching to VOO for the portability. Whatever I choose would be more of a net worth vehicle and less focused on income from dividends (though high dividend reinvesting is fine if that would make growth greater).

VOO,1om2abu,investing,Should I invest some emergency funds?,"I save and invest regularly and have around $80K cash in my savings. Close to $1.5M in retirement. I should be getting a bonus this year which would prob may be $50K, or $30K net. My wife and I make great income as our HHI is just under $430K. For the last couple of years I’ve been keeping this balance in our regular savings (MMA) thinking I was going to redo the outside of my home (siding, roof, windows, driveway, porch etc) and it still hasn’t happened yet…just didn’t get around to it. I may want to do it in the Spring but I’m thinking, I’ll soon have over $100K in there. Maybe I should just drop it on VOO or one of those ARK ETFs and call it a day. I’d still keep up my regular investments, max 401k, and brokerage (about $80K/yr total). My point to all this is, maybe I should just put this money into the market and take a HELOC out to do my home construction? We have plenty left over each month where we could easily pay a couple thousand each month for a loan. But putting a nice $100K chunk into my brokerage in one shot could be worth potentially another $750K for retirement in the next 20yrs; I’m sure the investments would yield much more of a return compared to a HELOC rate. I just feel like it’s such a waste to have that money sitting in the bank earning 3%. Plus, brokerage account funds are fairly liquid should I need to suddenly pay something outright. I know I should’ve invest med this a couple of years ago, it would’ve blown up as to what’s been going on in the market, and this money sadly missed the boat.

I’m 22 with a 401k 100% rolled into a 500 index fund with an expense ratio of .05 (maybe a little higher than others but a good start to retirement investing I think). Wanted to set up another retirement account so I decided on a Roth IRA for the tax benefits. I have a hysa and an emergency fund account already. I want my Roth to be invested into solely into index/mutual funds and etfs. I can max out the account right now but I’m in a dilemma of where I break up the money into. I’m leaning towards QQQ but seen QQQM has a lower expense ratio. I think tech is going to be revolutionary in 10 years so that’s a no brainer to invest in that. I love VOO but I don’t want to over lap since I’m in the 500 index fund already. I’d like to have some money invested in the total world stock market and then also be invested into mid-low cap companies.

SPY,1o2ctn5,investing,Should my parents' investments have doubled over the past 5 years?,"Hello, My parents have someone who manages their money and I've just started learning about finance myself. I put all of my money into SPY and VTI, both of which have nearly doubled in the past 5 years. However, from speaking to my parents, it sounds like their money has not doubled in that timeframe (or anything close to that really). When I mentioned that VTI had nearly 7x'd since 2000, they seemed very surprised. My father mentioned that he has indicated to their manager that he prefers aggressive investments, and that every team he meets with the 'money manager' this person says they're 'beating the baseline'. My first reaction was that this seems negligent on the part of the money manager, or, at the very least that we should consider ditching them and just investing in SPY/VTI. I'm very confused what the 'baseline' could be other than SPY/VTI that they're consistently beating (but still only up 20 or 30% in the past 5 years). Am I missing something? Note that I haven't posted in FatFIRE, I don't think this is ""stop playing"" territory, and I'm very curious if they are being scammed.",0,43,2025-10-09 17:51:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o2ctn5/should_my_parents_investments_have_doubled_over/,2025-11-07 16:47:05.934403,0.4,$SPY,0.8,[],[],0.7,Broad Market ETF
