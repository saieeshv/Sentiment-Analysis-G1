T,1o7954w,wallstreetbets,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys, Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact! But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well! I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31. End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross. https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53 Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into. Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS **What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. **They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH** Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** **DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** **The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this: https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45 These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops… **New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week??? Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. ***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…*** **IV / TA** Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75 This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies! **Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… * Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025 * UBS raised price target to 40 from 32 * Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating) * LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” **Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings. 40 x Jan '26 $55c 30x December '25 $55c 55x November $50c https://preview.redd.it/jrbuvp1pc9vf1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41b4bb0a338a482e04bf764f2a5631775eaaad9 https://preview.redd.it/g7fd1kt1d9vf1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a14dbebe04ebc73b0a744f9d317c51bdabd874 TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

Just sharing some common knowledge that apparently is not so common to investors. Read News,SEC Filings and press releases to not mess up facts. As an Analyst I want all my knowledge to be detail oriented and precise. Used Pinegap Ai for that so that I dont have to run for resources everywhere You can access the filings too from this link. [https://www.pinegap.ai/UNH/documents/filings](https://www.pinegap.ai/UNH/documents/filings) . Also,here is a must read govt report by USDHHS [https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2024/medicare-advantage-questionable-use-of-health-risk-assessments-continues-to-drive-up-payments-to-plans-by-billions/](https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2024/medicare-advantage-questionable-use-of-health-risk-assessments-continues-to-drive-up-payments-to-plans-by-billions/) Let me know your views on this,Sorry if this goes too long. Tried to be precise. UNH's Medicare Advantage business is their cash cow...Pulled in $139B last year it is built on a foundation of straight up fraud: upcoding, where the company inflates patient diagnoses to trick the government into overpaying! We are talking about logging healthy seniors as having severe and life threatening conditions...they dont even have, pocketing extra reimbursements for sicker patients who never even needed the care. Investigative journalism found out billions of claims from 2019-2021 and uncovered $50B in industrywide fraud, with UNH as the main leader, billing for hundreds of thousands questionable diagnoses like deadly illnesses that patients couldn’t possibly have...Not to sound very woke here, But it's taxpayer money siphoned straight into executive bonuses and stock buybacks while grandma's premiums skyrocket. \-In May 2025: The DOJ healthcare fraud unit is interviewing ex employees,doctors and whistleblowers about whether UNH pressured providers to fudge claims...boosting payments by billions. And after all that we got to know that its not just bad accounting...its potential criminal fraud, with prosecutors grilling folks on how UNH revises diagnosis codes to increase claim values. Shares tanked 13-20% on the news alone, and UNH's response? ""We're cooperating"" while hiding behind ""independent audits"" that conveniently say they're accurate. A court-appointed special master in a prior case already smelled the rot, but the DOJ's pushing forward because the evidence is overwhelming.",68,87,2025-10-03 11:45:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwwuk9/a_dive_in_unhs_great_fall_and_frauds_committed/,2025-10-23 09:04:08.395982,1.0,$UNH,0.6,['UNH'],"['rocket', 'sec filing']",0.9114285714285714
T,1o6qrdt,ValueInvesting,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. But even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. Valuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market ""has"" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. So while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. Here's why I don't expect a crash. >***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** >\~ Peter Lynch I think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. In 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. In 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. Today, just look at the market. Look at the S&P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low. Interest coverage ratios are well within historical bounds ([Goldman Sachs: Exhibit 11](https://www.goldmansachs.com/ayco/materials/isg-content/ISG-impact-of-rising-rates-on-corporate-debt-us-equities.pdf) & [JPM: Page 13](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf)). And these should only improve as rates come down. And yes, the Mag 7 make up 30% of the index. But even if the market grew a conscience tomorrow and re-rated the Mag 7 down by 40%, that only represents a 12% decline in the market. ***The system isn't static.*** >I owned META in 2022 when it was trading at single digit PE levels. I sold it on the basis that the metaverse was a business endeavor that was a destruction in value. They were burning so much cash on it. >Later that year, Zuck announced that they were scaling back investment on that project, and the rest was history. I never bought back in. >This is an important lesson when looking at the current state of fiscal policy. We shouldn’t anchor to the 30% global tariffs and 130% tariffs on iPhones. As policy changes, we should update our valuation assumptions with it. I do think we should be cognizant of how unhinged and random the administration is with trade policy, and perhaps ‘some’ extra risk premium should be applied to the market to account for it, but we probably shouldn’t expect some massive repricing event right now. >Yes, tariffs are still on, but the 10% range is something that is much more palatable for US businesses and consumers. >Also, the walk-back in policy this past week does signal that the POTUS put is in play. Donald does care what markets are doing. >\~ [Me, April 12th, 2025](https://substack.com/@riskpremium/note/c-108294047?r=1r289e&utm_source=notes-share-action&utm_medium=web) This lesson extends to AI capex as well. There's nothing that says that if AI isn't working out that all these companies have to stick with those projects. And the outcome is net zero. Whatever cash comes off of Nvidia's CF statement only lifts the bottom line for the other constituents. So sure, Nvidia probably gets hammered. But it only helps the other companies' bottom lines. That's not to say Microsoft and Google, et. al won't get hurt. There's a lot of potential energy stored in these AI projects. But if the market deems AI as a money-loser, I can only imagine the market will cheer if they pare back on AI projects. ***There still is some bubble behavior.*** With all that being said, there are some pockets of the market that do worry me. Companies like Oklo, Quantumscape, Joby are all pricing in the prospects of a very different future. And that's usually a bad bet. I'm also seeing companies like Solid Power being resurrected from the dead despite having no product, no potential of a product, and on no news. That stock is up almost 7-fold off the lows. These are just a few of the stocks that I follow; you probably personally see it in your own areas of interest. But we're still no where near the levels of euphoria that we saw in late 2020 / early 2021 where ARK funds were a ""sure thing"" and NFTs were auctioning for millions. That's the level of behavior that I think I want to see before I got worried about euphoria. And yes, tariffs worry me, and the prospect of a trade war worries me. But again, the system is dynamic. There's really nothing that says tariffs = recession in the same way that Covid didn't equal a global financial meltdown. ***Summary*** I don't think I see a path to a stock market washout, just yet. 2021 & 2000 are the models for euphoria. 2008 is the model for financial irresponsibility. We currently have neither. AI probably is a bubble, but I also don't think we're pricing in some manic level of optimism there either. Maybe if we get to a point where AI tokens become a line item on balance sheets, then I'll start to worry. We're not there yet. That's not to say there isn't excess we could work off, though. And if you're scared of a 20% - 30% correction, that's perfectly okay. It's probably just a sign that you're not positioned correctly for your risk tolerance. I'm not full equities, and I'm certainly no where near 100% US stocks. ***In a world where investors are going increasingly risk-on, it makes sense to take your foot off the pedal.*** But we also shouldn't let the prospect of a 25% correction shake us out of the markets completely. To end with another Peter Lynch quote: >***Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.*** >\~ Peter Lynch",136,111,2025-10-14 20:27:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6qrdt/why_the_ai_bubble_may_not_pop_anytime_soon/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.040036,1.0,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'pe ratio']",0.9114285714285714
AMZN,1nvuluv,ValueInvesting,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why. Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income. This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything. Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations. So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks: * TSLA: 91.3x * NVDA: 59.0x * AAPL: 34.9x * MSFT: 28.3x * GOOGL: 22.1x * AMZN: 19.4x * META: 17.6x Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.",252,127,2025-10-02 04:49:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nvuluv/amzn_is_cheaper_than_you_think/,2025-10-23 09:05:31.720228,1.0,$AMZN,0.6,[],['rally'],0.9057142857142856

AMZN,1obqpxr,ValueInvesting,Value Trap - AMZN,"I have seen a few comments today about AMZN being a value trap, and they are mentioning because of the increasing competition. I see the massive and relentless reinvestments that Amazon makes, and they usually oay off. Competition: I do see walmart online as the main competition to Amazon (not Temu or otherwise). With Walmart having such a big physical imprint, their online presence is still way behind, in fact most of us don’t even consider it very often. I believe this is slowly going to change over the next 5-10 years. Walmart is roughly 6% of the online Ecommerce space and Amazon is 6x that, at roughly 35%. I believe the best way to Amazon to continue to compete against Walmart is to keep growing their physical footprint with Whole Food Market and Amazon Fresh. I believe Amazon will integrate their online platform with the physical a lot better than Walmart, which will lead to further growth. Amazon is utilizing technology that makes shopping easier, like the walk-in, walk-out approach, no register needed. We all know how they’re ranking in video streaming, cloud computing, and digital advertising (in the top 3 for all of those) and we know that the competition is fierce. I feel confident in Amazon’s moves. They’re going to be covering every corner of the US market online, and physical. I really believe their big move will be the physical and that will help assist in the growth for the rest.

T,1ochvdl,wallstreetbets,Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager,"My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following: 1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle. https://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e 2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections. 3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have gone up in greater magnitudes. It seems like whenever a big deal gets done involving AI, the company involved sees a big stock bump. Each of these AI companies are up well over 50% since June. Meanwhile, **Meta has been flat since June** and up 20% on the year. This indicates that Meta still has a lot of potential to run up as an AI play. For those that argue that Meta isn’t an AI play, Meta has just announced in October a $1.5b investment to build AI-focused datacenters in Texas, $14b agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave, and financing a $30b datacenter complex in Louisiana. **Given these recent Q3 investments, I believe a large focus of the Q3 earnings to be around how Meta will be a massive AI play (through providing AI-focused datacenters/infrastructure).** **Potential Issues** With any play, there will be concerns for the play moving in the opposite direction. These are what I see to be the biggest areas of concern for Wallstreet. 1. Large Capex spend – Wallstreet usually doesn’t like significant increases in spending. Note that this is actually also my second point for beating earnings. I believe it’ll be unlikely that Meta simply just says they are doubling capex without any support. In my mind, management will either show significant revenue increases or some other way to justify the increase in capex. 2. Ad Market Concerns – If Meta indicates weak ad demand for the upcoming quarter/year, then that can cause the stock to go down. However, I read recently that AI-powered recommendation models boosted conversions by upwards of 3-5%. Management could definitely use this justification as to why they are supporting AI. Given the magnitude of the capex increase from 2024-2026 though, I just don’t really see them communicating weak ad market demand. It just doesn’t really make sense to communicate a weakening market while simultaneously communicating massive spending increases. 3. User engagement risk – As a social media platform, investors look at Meta’s daily active users as an indication of Meta’s earning potential. Just last month, Zuckerberg announced a record high over 3b daily active users. There has been no real indication that user engagement is at risk. **The Play** **My play here is to hold a mix of Meta stocks and call options**. I have calls expiring 10/31 and 11/07 around the current price simply to capture my expected earnings boost, while my shares are there for long-term holding. One note: my personal opinion is that we are in an AI-bubble and at some point the bubble will likely burst. If that happens before Meta earnings comes out, our portfolios are probably already cooked anyways. Below are my positions: https://preview.redd.it/gyx11p4cthwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5914d0c907b930e0f1ee2031493e4172c891c17e Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

T,1o6zdti,ValueInvesting,$GRRR - most undervalued AI play on the market,"Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR) could be the ONLY undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April. The company sits around a $400 million market cap, yet holds over $100 million in cash, has minimal debt (~$16M) , and recently announced a $1.4 billion contract in Singapore. This isn’t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics. They build the foundation that smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers run on. ⸻ ⭐️What Makes GRRR Different While companies like BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across Southeast Asia, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases. Now they are expanding internationally, and that’s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called One Amazon. ⸻ ⭐️The One Amazon Project One Amazon isn’t connected to Amazon the company. It’s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the Amazon rainforest. It’s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). These names alone show that this project isn’t just another idea, it’s a coordinated global effort. What makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where each token represents one hectare of protected land. This gives it actual meaning, something that connects digital assets to real environmental impact. It’s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It’s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation. The global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at COP30 next month, one of the world’s most important climate events. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens** out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial. Here’s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the primary technology provider for One Amazon, delivering the AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the One Amazon token, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked. In simple terms, Gorilla isn’t just associated with One Amazon, they’re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected, Gorilla’s name could become a household name around the world. There’s a video on the official One Amazon website that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look. ⸻ ⭐️2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook Gorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead: Revenue: Expected between $100 million and $110 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA: Projected between $20 million and $25 million. Gross Margin: Expected to be 40–45%. Global Project Pipeline: Over $5 billion, with about $1 billion in contracts targeted for closure by mid-2026. These numbers show Gorilla isn’t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent $105 million registered direct offering at an offering price of $17.50 per share (current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a major institutional investor, gave them over 100 million in cash to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders. ⸻ ⭐️The Numbers Tell the Story At a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet. That $1.4B Singapore contract alone is worth more than three times the company’s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla’s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the S&P Global BMI Index, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention. ⸻ ⭐️Why I Think It’s Special What stands out about Gorilla is that it’s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They’re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow. If the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla’s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years. Yes, there’s still execution and volatility risk since it’s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn’t priced in yet. ⸻ ⭐️Why the Market Hasn’t Caught On Yet A big reason why GRRR is still so heavily discounted comes down to perception. It’s not a U.S. company, and most of its major customers are in Asia, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can’t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy “risk discount.” There have also been fraud allegations floating around earlier this year from short-seller reports. But when you actually dig into the details, most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated. The accusations didn’t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise, no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals. Shorts have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when Q3 earnings is released mid-Nov. Then there’s CEO Jay Chandan. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He’s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla’s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there’s substance behind the story. Jay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He’s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility. Dr. Raj Natarajan, Gorilla’s current CTO, previously spent years at Microsoft leading product and engineering teams, and Thomas Sennhauser, Intel’s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific, recently joined Gorilla’s Board of Directors. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at HPE in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company’s credibility, you can take a look at this post Their core team includes engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists who’ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for more than two decades. This isn’t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they’ve been quietly doing this work long before “AI infrastructure” became a buzzword. So yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO’s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn’t add up. It’s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there. ⸻ ⭐️TL;DR Gorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a $400M market cap with over $100M in cash, minimal debt (~$16M) and a $1.4B contract already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the One Amazon initiative, which includes partners like the White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB, and will officially launch at COP30 next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project’s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world’s first digital assets with true real-world meaning. While everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centres, and sustainable finance to power real‑world projects on a global scale. It will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.

T,1o65niu,stocks,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out. Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment. Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy. They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that? Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results. But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K. So the real question is this: Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak? Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot? To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",0,12,2025-10-14 04:09:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.880180,1.0,$T,0.9,"['TSLA', 'RERE']","['rally', 'revenue', 'profit', 'loss', 'eps']",0.7285714285714285

UNH,1o2vqzy,ValueInvesting,How I bought UNH before Buffett announced,"Steps I took: 1. Assess if their company's moat is now under pressure in the long run or if the situation is short-term. Conclusion: Healthcare industry will be intact unless a major change such as universal healthcare will be implemented by the government. Changes in regulation around healthcare may create short-term turbulence, but not enough to sway me from believing in the industry long-term. As for top management, Stephen Helmsley, I believe, is the correct person to manage the company during turbulent times. Lastly, did a relative analysis and found that UNH is operating way more efficient vs peers (8.1% operating margin vs nearest competitor 4.51%) 2. Do a conservative DCF and see if the company is below intrinsic value. (didn't use beta for cost of capital as I don't see it as a measure of risk for investments) Conclusion: At the time that I was analyzing the stock, it was before WSJ announced the fraud allegation and its price as at above $300. Saw this as undervalued already using my conservative DCF. 3. Bought UNH when I had cash and it is currently 40%\~ of my portfolio.

Their imminent pipeline includes: - Prince of Persis Remake - AC Black Flag Remake - Splinter Cell game - Gritty Assassins Creed set in 18th century Germany - Rayman game - Far Cry game I don’t see any of these games end up being flops. Ubisoft suffered from poor release cadence and several bombs in a row (Avarar, Star Wars Outlaws, Skull&Bones, XDefiant) Their financials should improve a lot next year.

T,1nvc9d4,financialindependence,Just laid off. How's my plan for retirement?,"52M, losing my job and wondering if I need to replace it. We have 1M in brokerage, 200k in BTC, 1.5M in my 401k and 600k in my wife's 401k. Expenses are 110k per year, basically. If we go to 140k per year, it's comfortable. Bare minimum is 93k per year, but we plan for 110k. She has and will always have her job teaching. She's tenured, no pension, only the 401k. It brings in 34k after taxes and with us sending the max to the 401k, including catch up. Her raises have never kept up with inflation. Putting 3M into ficalc and asking for 40 years of planning, it says we are all set. It gives like a 96% chance of us being good, even without her salary, or even ssa. If we include her income, it's 100% success. 1. Do you agree that I can retire now? 2. How best to handle the 3 accounts? The taxable one has 300k in 3 month t bills and 93k in swvxx. The rest of that money has big taxable gains, probably 400k of gains. Given that we have 4-5 years of expenses in cash and t bills, I'm thinking the following: All of her 401k in a TDF set for when she plans to retire, say 2040. All of mine in a TDF set for when I turn 59.5, roughly 2030. Then basically leave the taxable alone; its mainly LLY, AAPL, NVDA, BRK.B and RNMBY. Even though I expect a downturn of 30% in the next year and bad inflation to follow, I should be able to wait it out. Starting in 2027, our tax bracket will be lower so we could sell equities if needed, but I don't see us doing that until 2029 at the soonest.",0,36,2025-10-01 16:02:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1nvc9d4/just_laid_off_hows_my_plan_for_retirement/,2025-10-23 09:08:35.623830,1.0,$T,0.5,[],[],0.7

I understand some current government administrations are pushing compliance regulation to the future, but most commercial entities are tending towards requiring systems like ReposiTrak. They have a low debt ratio, slightly elevated P/S and P/B but they’re a cloud saas company so to me that’s expected? The predicted eps next year is 25%, they have good margins and insiders hold a decent share which shows belief to me. They have competition but it seems like they rank fairly competitive to others and since they technically operate “globally” (Canada, USA, Mexico, and a bit in India) this should have less of an effect.

Below you'll find my complete brain dump on everything you need to know about DCF valuations (in a somewhat organized manner): # Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Discounted cash flow (DCF) estimates the intrinsic value of a company based on its expected future cash flows, discounted to present value (PV) using a rate that reflects the time value of money (TVM) and the risks associated with generating those future cash flows. **DCF Formula:** `PV₀ = (CF₁ / (1 + r)¹) + (CF₂ / (1 + r)²) + … + (CFₙ / (1 + r)ⁿ) + (TV / (1 + r)ⁿ)` **where**: * `PV₀` = present value (at time 0) * `CF` = cash flow at time *t* * `r` = discount rate (required rate of return) * `TV` = terminal value at the end of period *n* * `n` = number of periods in the explicit forecast period # Step #1: Understand the Business Often overlooked but the most important step: * Study SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A) - especially MD&A section. * Review earnings calls, investor presentations, IR website. * Identify key performance drivers (**internal**: new products/stores, efficiency improvements; **external**: market trends, macro factors, regulatory changes). * Understand business model, competitive moat, management quality, and industry outlook. The key is to avoid ""garbage in, garbage out."" # Step #2: Forecast Cash Flows **Forecast period:** Forecast cash flows to a point in the future where company's financial performance reaches a steady/normalized level (e.g., mature companies = 3-5 years; High-growth = 10+ years). **Cash flow types:** 1. **FCFF** (standard; unlevered) 2. **FCFE**, **Simple FCF**, **Owners Earnings** (Buffett's approach; all levered) 3. **EPS** (per-share, levered; use diluted over basic) * **FCFF formula:** `EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - CapEx - ΔNon-Cash NWC` * **FCFE formula:** `Net Income + D&A - CapEx - ΔNon-Cash NWC + Net Borrowing` * **Simple FCF:** `Operating Cash Flow - CapEx` * **Owners Earnings:** `Net Income + D&A - Maintenance CapEx` OR `Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance CapEx` * **Diluted EPS:** `(Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding` **Forecasting approaches:** * **\[1\] Apply growth rate direct to cash flow figure**: Just apply % growth, based on your understanding of business. * **\[2\] Build integrated model:** * Revenue growth (best/base/worst) * → COGS/OpEx/Other as % of revenue * → Fixed assets schedule (D&A, CapEx) * → Non-cash NWC schedule (ΔNon-Cash NWC) * → Effective-to-marginal tax rate transition. * **\[3\] Estimate growth from fundamentals** * See Damodaran's Investment Valuation book on estimating operating income (EBIT) and/or earnings from fundamentals. This is the most difficult step to complete accurately (since you're predicting the future). Just be conservative and use reasonable assumptions. You should be able to defend any of your assumptions. **Scenario analysis:** Develop multiple cases to produce valuation range instead of single point estimate. Use scenario analysis to address inherent uncertainty in cash flow forecasting. Also forces justification of base-case assumptions. Just create scenarios for worst/base/best case for the primary forecast driver (e.g., revenue growth for FCFF model, cash flow growth if applying growth directly). # Step #3: Estimate Discount Rate Discount rate represents the minimum rate of return investors require to compensate for TVM and risks associated with generating future cash flows. Two primary approaches exist: **\[1\] WACC (Standard Approach):** `(E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate)) + (P/V × Cost of Preferred)` **Cost of Equity:** 1. Standard **CAPM** = `rf + β × (rm - rf)` (only need CAPM for levered cash flows) 2. **Modified CAPM** = `rf + β × (rm - rf) + CSRP + SRP + CORP` **Risk-free rate (rf):** * Use 10-year government bond yield for country where company operates (e.g., for U.S: use 10-year Treasury bond rate). * MUST have: (1) no default risk + (2) no reinvestment risk. * For countries w/o default-free bonds: Use risk-free rate of default-free country + country default spread, OR use local government bond rate - default spread based on credit rating. * Use nominal rates (not real) for nominal cash flow forecasts. **Equity risk premium (rm - rf):** * **Implied ERP (recommended):** Forward-looking and most realistic. Available on Damodaran's website, updated regularly. * **Historical ERP:** Simple average or geometric average of historical stock returns over T-bonds. Limitation: backward-looking, high standard error, survivorship bias. * **Modified Historical ERP (for non-U.S. markets):** `Mature Market ERP + Country-Specific Risk Premium (CSRP)` * CSRP = Country default spread × (σ\_equity / σ\_bonds); where: σ = standard deviation * Weight CSRP by company's revenue exposure to each country **Beta (β):** * **Regression beta (flawed):** High standard error (\~0.20 median), reflects historical capital structure and business mix. Even with beta drifting (Blume adjustment: `Adjusted β = 2/3 × Raw β + 1/3 × 1`), still less reliable than bottom-up approach. * **Bottom-up beta (recommended):** Lower standard error, forward-looking. 1. Find comparable companies in same industry. 2. Calculate unlevered beta for each: `βu = βL / [1 + (1 - tc) × (D/E)]` 3. Take average/median unlevered beta (or weighted average if multi-segment firm). 4. Relever using target company's capital structure: `βL = βu × [1 + (D/E) × (1 - tc)]` * Use marginal tax rate (tc), not effective tax rate. **Country-Specific Risk Premium (CSRP):** * Apply only for companies with exposure to countries with sovereign default risk. * Again, weight by where company generates revenues (not just where incorporated). **Size Risk Premium (SRP):** * Historically used for small-cap stocks, but recent research shows premium has largely disappeared since 1981. * Instead of SRP: Apply higher margin of safety, adjust cash flows for small-cap specific risks, use scenario analysis. **Company-Specific Risk Premium (CORP):** * Subjective premium for unique risks not captured by beta (e.g., customer concentration, key person dependence, operational inefficiencies). * Alternative: Adjust cash flows directly rather than inflating discount rate **Cost of Debt:** Five methods available: 1. **Yield to Maturity (YTM) - Most accurate for bond-heavy companies:** * Calculate YTM for each outstanding bond using `YIELD` function in Excel * Weighted average: `Σ(Bond Principal × YTM) / Total Debt` * Requires: settlement date, maturity date, coupon rate, market price, frequency (10-K and FINRA is good source). 2. **Current Yield - Quick approximation:** * `Current Yield = Annual Coupon Payment / Current Market Price` * Weighted average across all bonds. * Less accurate than YTM (ignores capital gains/losses at maturity). 3. **Debt Rating Method:** * `rd = rf + Default Spread` based on company's credit rating. * Add country spread if significant sovereign risk exposure. * Use market yields on corporate bonds matching company's rating and maturity. 4. **Synthetic Rating Method - When no official rating exists:** * Calculate Interest Coverage Ratio: `ICR = EBIT / Interest Expense` * Map ICR to synthetic rating using Damodaran's tables (separate tables for large vs. small firms) * `rd = rf + Synthetic Rating Spread` 5. **Interest Expense to Total Debt - Least accurate:** * `rd = Interest Expense / Total Debt` * Simple but use only when other methods unavailable. * Can be distorted by old debt at non-market rates. **After-tax cost of debt:** `rd × (1 - tc)`; where: tc = marginal tax rate **Cost of Preferred Stock:** `rp = (Preferred Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Preferred Share) + g` * g = perpetual dividend growth rate (if applicable; often zero for fixed-rate preferred). * If multiple series: Calculate weighted average based on market values. * If preferred stock < 5% of firm value: Include with debt or ignore entirely. Really only common in financial institutions (banks use for regulatory capital requirements). **WACC Weights:** Use **market values**, not book values: * **Debt (D):** Sum of (1) market value of bonds (face value × market price/100) + (2) book value of bank loans, leases, other debt. * Alternative if bond prices unavailable: Use synthetic bond approach to convert total book value debt to market value. * **Preferred (P):** Preferred shares outstanding × market price per preferred share (summed across all series). * **Equity (E):** Basic shares outstanding × current stock price (market cap). * **Total Value (V):** D + P + E. **Weights**: wd = D/V; wp = P/V; we = E/V Pro tip: You can spend a lot of time calculating the WACC, depending on a number of different factors. But what's worth more of your time is estimating future cash flows (step #2). **\[2\] Personal Required Rate of Return:** `Personal Required Rate = Risk-free Rate + Your Required Premium` * **When to use:** Quick valuations, when WACC is too complex/uncertain, or if you have personal return requirements. WACC is useful, but also flawed (largely due to CAPM assumptions). * **Risk-free rate:** Same 10-year government bond yield from WACC approach. * **Your required premium:** Based on your minimum acceptable return from the company's future cash flows (e.g., 15% for small-cap, 8% for blue-chip). Very subjective, depends on goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, opportunity cost, etc. * **Trade-off:** Simple and reflects personal thresholds, but less precise than WACC and doesn't capture company-specific capital structure or systematic risk. For the discount rate, you'd apply the same rate across all forecast years and terminal value. # Step #4: Estimate Terminal Value Terminal value (TV) captures all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period, typically representing 50-75% of total firm value. Three methods exist (but EMM and PGM are most realistic)**:** * **\[1\] Liquidation Value:** Estimates value based on selling company assets. Use when business will cease operations or for asset-heavy businesses being wound down. * **Book value approach:** `Terminal Year Book Value × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Average Asset Life` * **Earning power approach:** `TV = Σ(Expected Cash Flows from Asset Sales_t / (1 + r)^t)` for disposal period; where r = cost of capital (WACC). * **\[2\] Exit Multiple Method (EMM):** Applies market-based multiples to terminal year metrics. * **Formula:** `TV = Terminal Year Metric × Exit Multiple` * **Common multiples:** EV/EBITDA (standard), EV/EBIT, EV/Sales, EV/FCFF for enterprise value; P/E, P/B, P/S, P/FCFE for equity value. * Use median/average of comparable companies or sector multiples. * **Limitation:** Mixes intrinsic DCF with relative valuation; can perpetuate market mispricing. * **\[3\] Perpetual Growth Method (PGM):** Assumes stable growth forever (most theoretically sound). * **No-growth perpetuity:** `TV = Final Year CF / r` * **Gordon Growth Model:** `TV = (Final Year CF × (1 + g)) / (r - g)` * **Constraints:** Growth rate (g) cannot exceed economy growth rate (use risk-free rate as proxy); g must be below discount rate (r); negative g possible for declining businesses. * Terminal year cash flows must reflect stable company characteristics (normalized margins, sustainable CapEx, returns at industry averages). **Cross-check PGM and EMM:** Optional but can be useful for checking if TV assumptions are realistic: * **Implied growth rate:** `g = ((TV_EMM × r) - CF_Term) / (TV_EMM + CF_Term)`; where TV\_EMM = terminal value from exit multiple method, r = discount rate, CF\_Term = terminal year cash flow. * **Implied multiple:** Implied Multiple = TV\_PGM / Metric\_Term; where TV\_PGM = terminal value from perpetual growth method, Metric\_Term = terminal year financial metric. * For mid-year convention (discussed below), multiply terminal year CF by `(1 + r)^0.5` in implied growth formula (numerator and denominator); multiply TV by `(1 + r)^0.5` in implied multiple formula (just numerator). # Step #5: Calculate Present Value and Determine Valuation Discount factor converts future cash flows to present value. Different approaches vary based on timing assumptions--when cash flows are assumed to occur during the year: * **\[1\] Fiscal Year-End (FY-End):** `Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + r)^n` * Assumes all cash flows occur at fiscal year-end (standard DCF approach). * Terminal value uses same discount factor as final year. * **\[2\] Mid-Year Convention:** `Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + r)^(n - 0.5)` * More realistic - assumes cash flows occur at mid-year. * Results in higher valuations (less discounting). * For EMM terminal value: use full n periods; for PGM terminal value: use (n - 0.5). * Not suitable for companies with highly seasonal/lumpy cash flows. * **\[3\] Stub Periods:** Adjusts for valuation date falling within first forecast year: * **Stub period fraction:** `Days Between Valuation Date and Next FY-End / 365` * **Stub-adjusted Year 1 CF:** `Forecasted Year 1 CF × Stub Period Fraction` * **FY-End with stub:** Year 1 uses stub period; subsequent years add 1.0 * **Mid-year with stub:** Year 1 uses `Stub Period / 2`; Year 2 uses `Stub Period + 0.5`; subsequent years add 1.0... * **\[4\] Mid-Year Convention with Stub Periods:** Combines both adjustments for maximum precision. **Calculate present value:** 1. `PV of CF = CF × Discount Factor` for each period (including TV). 2. Sum all discounted cash flows + discounted terminal value. 3. **For FCFF:** Result = implied enterprise value → Bridge to implied equity value: `EV + Cash & Equivalents + Non-Operating Assets - Total Debt - Preferred Stock - Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Lease Liabilities` 4. **For FCFE/Simple FCF/EPS:** Result = implied equity value directly (since levered). 5. `Implied Share Price = Implied Equity Value / Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding` (don't need if forecasting EPS, since already per-share). **Determine valuation (before MoS):** * Compare implied share price to current market price to determine valuation (more specifics below). * `Premium/(Discount) = (Implied Share Price / Market Price) - 1`. Positive % = undervalued; \~0% = fairly valued; negative % = overvalued **Apply margin of safety (MoS) -- always do to account for uncertainty/errors:** * **Formula:** `Buy Price = Implied Share Price × (1 - MoS%)` * Higher MoS for less confidence (uncertain cash flows, small companies, complex models). * Lower MoS for high confidence (mature companies, predictable industries). **Determine valuation (after MoS):** * **Buy price > market price:** Stock is undervalued; potential buying opportunity. * **Buy price ≈ market price:** Stock is fairly valued; market price reflects your estimate of intrinsic value. * **Buy price < market price:** Stock is overvalued; current price exceeds your conservative estimate of value. # Step #6: Sensitivity Analysis Tests how changes in key assumptions affect valuation to understand which variables matter most and stress-test the model. Key variables to test, include discount rate (WACC), terminal value assumptions (for PGM), and margin of safety (directly impacts buy price). How to build sensitivity tables in Excel: 1. Ensure DCF model works correctly (no circular references and inputs are not hard-coded). 2. Create grid template (e.g., 5×5) with two variables (e.g., WACC vs. perpetual growth rate). 3. Top-left cell: reference implied share price or buy price. 4. Input base-case values for both variables. 5. Define delta (Δ) changes - incremental steps for testing (e.g., WACC ±0.50%, perpetual growth ±0.25%). 6. Select entire range including variable values and empty grid. 7. Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table → Set row input cell (first variable) and column input cell (second variable). Look for smooth, proportional changes across scenarios (sudden jumps or irregular patterns suggest model errors). Then, identify which variables have largest impact on valuation. # Reverse DCF Works backwards from current market price to determine what growth rate is implied by that price. Very useful before building full DCF model to assess if detailed analysis is worthwhile. How to perform: 1. Ensure DCF model works correctly (again, inputs shouldn't be hard-coded). 2. Use Excel Goal Seek: Data → What-If Analysis → Goal Seek 3. Set implied share price cell to current market price. 4. Change --> growth rate assumption cell. 5. Excel calculates implied growth rate. You should compare the implied growth rate to your understanding of the business (probably influenced by historical performance, industry, management guidance). Evaluate whether market expectations are reasonable, optimistic, or pessimistic. # DCF Pros & Cons DCF's strengths include its focus on cash flows, market independence, and flexibility in modeling scenarios. Its main weaknesses are sensitivity to assumptions, terminal value dominance, and the time required for proper analysis. Regardless, DCF analysis forces disciplined thinking about cash flow generation. In fact, DCF's greatest value lies in its process of explicitly modeling cash flows and testing assumptions, making investors better analysts regardless of the final valuation number. \--- Hope you found this useful!

T,1ntlfop,investing,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations. Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy. Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology. Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase. With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025. Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average. This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz. Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer. Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi, Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182. Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises. Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026. The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive. Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical. Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets. Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology. This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles. Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue. In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to $2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025. Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence. Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD. This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share. While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. Competition from Samsung and SK Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending. There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins. Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution. This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and supports Micron’s long-term strategy. Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow throughout the decade. Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge. From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend. Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities. Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE, and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities. As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon. Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock. Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent. Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case. Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand, attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks. As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026. Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction. Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady. With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space. The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful long-term edge. The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow. All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years ahead.",0,9,2025-09-29 15:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.316639,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.8,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'earnings', 'rally', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.7457142857142857
T,1nup0e9,ValueInvesting,Is Salesforce going to go anywhere?,"I bought CRM at $260. Estimated non-GAAP EPS of $12.7 for the next FY yielded a forward PE of 20.5x at my purchase price. I was happy with that price for a software company with a moat. Afterwards, the “AI is going to eat software” narrative hit the sector. Earnings were fine but the market punished it for hair’s breadth miss for next quarter’s EPS guidance. The Data Cloud and Agentforce combo segment grew by 120% y-o-y to an annualized revenue of $1.2 billion. Not bad for a $40 billion revenue company but obviously didn’t set pulses racing. The whole sector has been whacked hard over the last few months. And it doesn’t help that they’re showing high correlation — one stock’s poor earnings hurt all other stocks, but good earnings for one don’t lift others (naturally). I do believe Marc Benioff’s narrative that enterprise AI would end up along the lines of SaaS products (plays on the core skill set of software companies) rather than each company configuring their own AI solution (regular companies don’t have the software skills). Obviously, that implies the sad truth that AI would be built on top of legacy software — but isn’t that where the data repository of corporations is? So I’m hoping that the Dreamforce conference and subsequent earnings can turn the narrative around. But I don’t know. Does it look like a stock that can trade at 25x PE any time soon, let alone 30x?

T,1o8aogz,ValueInvesting,Universal Insurance Holdings ($UVE) - A quiet insurance stock that might be seriously undervalued right now,"I’ve been digging into Universal Insurance Holdings ($UVE) lately, and I think it’s one of those low-float, under-the-radar names that could be setting up for a sneaky run to end 2025. $UVE is a Florida-based property & casualty insurer, mostly homeowners' insurance. Small cap (\~$807M), trades around $28.50/share, pays a slight above a 2% dividend. It usually sits in the “boring but stable” category. **Here’s why I think it’s actually a pretty compelling value right now:** # 1. The market is missing how good this hurricane season has been We’re basically at the tail end of hurricane season, and the latest GFS models are showing *virtually zero* risk of a major storm hitting the U.S. through the end of October. That’s rare, and if it holds, it’ll be the first year with no U.S. landfalls in quite a while. For an insurer like UVE, that’s massive. Fewer hurricanes = fewer claims = better underwriting margins. Most of their reinsurance coverage never gets touched, so more premiums drop straight to earnings. Historically, a “clean” hurricane season translates to a 20-30% jump in book value and EPS the following year. The kicker is that markets are usually slow to react until the next earnings release confirms it. # 2. Cheap valuation with room to re-rate At \~$28.5, UVE’s: * P/E \~12x * P/B \~1.7x * ROE \~15% * Dividend yield \~2.25 If they post strong Q4 results (which seems likely), that P/E could compress to \~10x on forward earnings. Give it even a modest re-rating to 15x (which peers like HCI and RNR trade at in stable years), and you’re looking at a fair value closer to $35–$38/share, plus the dividend. Not bad for a company that’s essentially printing underwriting profits right now. # 3. Despite recent momentum, the price hasn’t really moved Even though there’s been a small upward trend lately, UVE is still trading right around the same price it was back in early June when hurricane season started. That means the market is valuing the company *exactly the same* now as it did when there was a real risk of a major landfall event. Fast forward to mid-October, and we’ve almost cleared the season with no significant U.S. hurricanes and the price hasn’t meaningfully rerated. That disconnect feels like a clear case of sentiment lagging fundamentals. # 4. Behavioral lag = opportunity Insurance stocks are always laggards after a quiet season because investors don’t trust it’ll stay quiet. Everyone assumes the next hurricane is just around the corner. That creates a classic underreaction setup where fundamentals improve faster than sentiment. Combine that with low analyst coverage, thin volume, and general “who cares” vibes toward insurers in a bull market, and you’ve got the recipe for mispricing. # 4. Florida risk isn’t what it used to be Florida’s insurance market used to be a mess (litigation, fraud, rate caps). But the reforms from 2023-24 actually made a difference. Fewer frivolous claims, faster approvals for rate hikes, and more stability overall. It’s not perfect, but it’s *way* better than two years ago, and UVE’s balance sheet reflects that. # 5. Simple risk/reward * **Upside:** 20–30% if earnings and valuation both improve * **Downside:** Limited near-term risk unless something truly freakish happens weather-wise * **Catalyst:** Q4 / FY earnings early 2025, confirming a strong combined ratio and better reinsurance pricing for next year So in my view, this is a smart asymmetric bet.

T,1ob6z1h,ValueInvesting,"95 years ago in one week’s time, Wall Street crashed. Here is a rather longish article on it. ( I don’t think we are there yet but there are subtle similarities, see if you can spot them)","Source: History’s Greatest Hits by Joseph Cummins Borrowed from Internet Library 1929 The Wall Street Crash: The Stockmarket Sell-off that Sparked a Worldwide Depression (Picture: An anxious crowd gathers on Wall Street on ""Black Thursday', 24 October 1929. The final crash came on 29 October, 'Black Tuesday'.) (Picture: In 1930, a year after the Crash, an unemployed man makes a heart-rending appeal fer a job, on a street corner in Detroit.) ONE MAN POISONED HIMSELF, his wife and his two young children. Another dropped dead in his stockbroker's office. Still another, who lived in a small town in North Carolina, went into his garage and shot himself, the echo careening around his quiet neighbourhood Rich and poor alike were affected. Winston Churchill, staying at a fancy New York hotel, awoke to a commotion. ""Under my very window, he later wrote, 'a gentleman cast himself fifteen stories and was dashed to pieces? Irving Berlin, the famous songwriter, remembered it this ways “I had all the money I wanted for the rest of my life. Then all of a sudden I didn't: It was 'Black Tuesday, 29 October 1929. Earlier that morning, in the first thirty minutes of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, over three million shares of stock had changed hands, something that normally took five hours. All of the major companies - General Electric, Chrysler, Standard Oil - were plummeting. Gradually, a crowd, later estimated at about ten thousand, filled thetiny winding streets around the exchange. Though the New York police commissioner placed extra security on the streets of the financial district, the people weren't violent. Instead, they seemed to be in shock. A reporter for The New York Times described the scene as 'a sort of paralysed hypnosis: Inside the exchange, a broker, looking out a window, had the horrible feeling that he was surrounded by 'haunted things. And this was only the start. American companies, their stock prices collapsing, either went bankrupt or laid off employees, instituting sharp drops in the production of goods. As people lost their jobs, they went through their savings and often lost their homes, as well. Their purchases - of new cars, furniture, clothing - dropped, and more companies began to close. Without money from industries and personal savings (and without federal banking insurance, something that is mandatory in the United States today), banks began to fail. The crash also had an international impact, too. With American businesses failing, the U.S. government instituted high tariffs on imported goods, hoping to stimulate the economy. The effect on foreign trade was disastrous. European countries, already experiencing their own financial difficulties due to overspeculation in their markets, found that the tariffs made it impossible for them to compete in the American marketplace. In response, they instituted their own tariffs, and international trade nearly ground to a standstill. ROARING TOWARDS DISASTER In America, along with the 1960s, the so-called Roaring Twenties is the twentieth-century decade most likely to be stereotyped.There, the name conjures up Prohibition,gangsters, flappers and bizarre fads. In fact,much of the stereotyping has a basis in fact.People were fad crazy in the United States. They held competitions to see how long theycould sit atop flagpoles. They took part indance marathons. They loved the new talking movies, the Marx Brothers, grand musical extravaganzas on Broadway and sneaking down to the corner 'speakeasy' for a little snort of bonded Canadian whisky - or so the proprietor claimed - on the sly. Driving all theses fads was the greatest fad of all: playing the stock market. Prior to this era, the buying and selling of stock had been a rich man's game. But by the twenties, one million Americans (out of a population of about 120 million) owned three hundred million shares of stocks in U.S. companies. This was in large part due to the advent of radio, telephone and, especially, the ticker-tape machine - a small electronic machine from which a paper tape issued showing stock price quotations, allowing one to check each 'tick' (upwards or downwards movement) of a stock, and communicate buy and sell orders almost instantly. The practice of buying stock 'on the margin' - paying only a portion of the stock's price yourself and borrowing the rest from a stockbroker - became so widespread that it seemed that you would have to be crazy not to play the market. As in the dot-com boom of the 1990s, stories abounded of ordinary people - the minister of the local church, a great aunt, that quiet girl working behind the perfume counter at Sears - amassing fortunes. If you just stuck your money in a bank, you were, in the parlance of the day, a sucker. THE BUSINESS OF AMERICA In the mid-1920s, most Americans were quite happy with this situation - and with their government. Following the trauma of the Great War and what had been shown to be a corrupt administration under President Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge became U.S. president in 1923. 'Silent Cal' came across as a country bumpkin - a man of few but trenchant words who did not suffer city slickers gladly. Gencrally, voters approved of his 'common man' approach, feeling that it mirrored their own feelings about themselves and their country. However, Coolidge was not quite what he appeared to be. In fact, he liked nothing better than to hobnob with the heads of major corporations in America at the time - John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Andrew Mellon. 'The business of America is business, Coolidge proclaimed. And: 'The man who builds a factory builds a temple.' Despite his working-man persona, Coolidge made basic changes that favoured the wealthy over the working class - for instance, he made Mellon his Secretary of the Treasury and then allowed him to reduce income tax rates for big businesses and the rich. Under Coolidge's presidency, business boomed. New technologies and procedures, which included Henry Ford's assembly line and improved techniques for refining oil, allowed companies to produce more iron, steel, gas and chemicals. But, unfortunately, this was a business and production boom, not an employment boom, since many of the new industrial methods had as their goal the elimination of manual labour. In a familiar story, the rich got richer as the poor got poorer - in the 1920s, according to historians, ninety per cent of the nation's wealth was concentrated in the hands of thirteen per cent of the population (today, roughly seventy per cent of wealth is held by ten per cent of the population). Indeed, this so-called 'New Era' of prosperity was to a large extent a chimera - as Mellon's tax cuts took effect, corporations which were making little in the way of profits had more money to spend, and they spent it on the stock market. And anyone in America who could afford to follow suit did so. There were four million unemployed people in America by the end of 1928, yet the Twenties roared on unabated. When Coolidge refused to run for president again in 1928, his wife told a friend, *Papa says there's going to be a depression, but those who heard this just laughed, clected another pro-business leader, Herbert Hoover, and kept on speculating. RIDING THE ROLLER COASTER During the summer of 1929, the stock market reached an all-time high, with record numbers of shares being purchased. But the situation was beginning to give pause to sober observers. For not only were more and more shares being bought on the margin, but also, as of early autumn 1929, only a third of stocks - about four hundred of twelve hundred listed on the New York Stock Exchange - had grown in value since the previous January. It was also noted that the huge 'stock trusts' - groups of wealthy investors who pooled their money to purchase stocks - could drive up almost any stock they wanted, simply by investing heavily in it. In September, an influential economist named Roger Babson made a speech in which he said that a crash was coming, and that there would likely be 'a stampede for selling which will exceed anything that the Stock Exchange has ever seen? Babson had been saying this for a year or so, but few had paid any attention to him previously. Now, however, his words echoed secret fears harboured by many, and a sell-off began. The market righted itself a few days later, but throughout September and into October it plunged up and down like a roller coaster. A FEEDING FRENZY When the stock market finally crashed on Tuesday 29 October, it was one of the bleakest days in American financial history, becoming forever known as Black Tuesday. But five days prior to this, on 24 October, a near-crash had already occurred. It became known as Black Thursday. Through early October, stocks had rebounded slightly as prominent bankers made calming statements to the effect that the market was simply adjusting itself. But late on the afternoon of Wednesday 23 October there was a sharp and terrifying plunge in the Dow Jones average (an index of select industrial stocks whose status is seen as an indicator of the health of the market in general) as brokers were flooded with sell orders by those who, like Babson, had finally decided the market was going to crash. In those days, unless they were wealthy enough to afford their own ticker tape machine, people congregated in brokers' offices all over the country to watch the progress of their stocks. Stock panics, even in today's era of personal computers, are highly contagious. Think how much more virulent they would have been when your fellow investors were sitting right next to you, sweating and yelling 'sell' orders. By the end of trading on Wednesday, six million shares had changed hands, with losses of US $4 billion dollars. That evening, stockbrokers began to make margin calls to those customers who had borrowed money to buy their stocks. In other words, the stockbrokers forced their clients to instantly repay the money they had borrowed to purchase the stock - the equivalent of a bank with whom you have a home mortgage suddenly contacting you to say that you need to pay off your entire mortgage at once or the bank will sell your house. Shortly after the market opened on Thursday, it sped downwards like a space rocket plummeting back to earth. Panicked crowds in Wall Street and around the country pushed their brokers to seil and speculators dumped stock quickly. When those who had been called for cash to meet their margins were unable to come up with it, the brokers sold the stocks quickly, to recover whatever part of their losses they could. It was a horrible feeding frenzy, made worse by the fact that the overwhelmed ticker tape system broke down and most stock quotations were forty-five minutes late. Since stocks were dropping twenty points in that interval, speculators and brokers were left in the dark about real values and began to sell blindly. By mid-afternoon, stocks had crashed to the tune of US$11.25 billion. The only thing that saved the market for another ""black' day was the fact that a consortium of bankers quickly pooled together about US$250 million and sent one of their members to walk the floor of the New York Stock Exchange making loud 'buy' orders, often at above the asking price. By the end of the day, the market had stabilised, but was still down to the tune of USS3 billion dollars, THE BLACKEST DAY Between this penultimate day of tragedy for Wall Street and Black Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board, prominent bankers and President Herbert Hoover worked feverishly to restore public confidence. The fundamental business of this country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis, Hoover said. (It was the kind of irrationally optimistic comment the nation would come to expect from this president. Later, when bankrupted doctors and businessmen were forced to sell apples on the street to make ends meet, he told a reporter: 'Many people have left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples.) But many people had been wiped out on Black Thursday, and those who hadn't began to wonder if they hadn't better sell in order to hang on to whatever savings they had left. Consequently, on Monday, 28 October, despite the reassurances, there was another plunge and near-crash. And on Tuesday, 29 October, the devastation really began. The day started with thousands of people congregating in Wall Street, as if they nceded to be present at what they sensed was going to be a historic moment. All of the major stocks - those linchpins upon which the market depended - began to crash before the horrified eyes of those on the floor of the stock exchange. ATXT lost 105 points in a few hours that morning. RCA plummeted from 110 to 26. Brokers received sell orders from their clients, and went into a frenzy trying to place them. In two hours, eight million shares of stock were sold. Onc broker, apparently driven to a nervous breakdown by the pace of the activity, began screaming and rushed from the exchange, knocking over anyone who got in his way. In the meantime, further margin calls ruined almost everyone who had borrowed to buy stocks. As the day wore on, people began to fall into shock. A reporter for The New York Times perceptively wrote that 'to most of those who have been in the market it is all the more awe inspiring because their financial history is limited to bull markets. In other words, these ordinary investors had never faced the full, clawing fury of a Wall Street bear market. At three o'clock, after five hours of trading, the market closed. Sixteen million shares had been traded. The nation had suffered an estimated USS15 billion dollars in losses. The Dow Jones had tumbled from 290 to 260 points, furthering its slide of 120 points since September. The stories of suicides began - as the humourist Will Rogers was to write sardonically, you had to stand in line to get a window to jump out of. While these tales are as exaggerated as some of the earlier boom tales of clerks gaining instant riches from stocks, there were some who took their own lives as a result of their financial ruin. Businesses began to die as well. The first to go were the investment firms, followed by companies that had overspeculated in stocks, and banks. Like a house of cards, the Roaring Twenties tumbled to an end. RISKS REMAIN Herbert Hoover had entered office in the greatest bull market of all time. By the time he left it, overwhelmingly beaten by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, he was surrounded by mobs chanting We want bread!' These days, historians do not place the blame for the Great Depression only on the 1929 Crash, but also on the Hoover Administration. Its economic policies, including high tariffs that stifled international trade and not issuing enough money, created a shortage of cash and did little to help stimulate the economy. There would be other stock market crashes, one in October 1987, another at the end of the dot-com boom after 2000. but these did not have nearly so catastrophic an effect on the world. Among the lessons learned after the 1929 Crash was that margin lending had to be controlled, that the government needed to provide insurance to banks - the glorious 'free market' needed in some sense to be regulated. Today, stocks, although they provide the highest return on the investment dollar, are still risky; and most ordinary investors cast concerned eyes upon their investment funds and pensions on a regular basis. The stories from 1929 of bodies thudding to the pavement - even if not all are true - remain a salutary warning. ——- A FAVOURITE WAY OUT Did as many people commit suicide after the 1929 crash as is often rumoured? Almost certainly not. John Kenneth Galbraith, in his book The Great Crash, studied U.S. death statistics and found that the number of suicides actually went down during the period from 1929 to 1932. And although some people did kill themselves, jumping out of windows was by no means the favourite way to go, dramatic as that was. According to William Klingaman, in his book 1929: The Year of the Great Crash, gas was the preferred means of shuffling off this mortal coil, followed by a gunshot wound straight to the heart. —- (Pictures are on my Reddit page)",38,13,2025-10-20 01:24:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ob6z1h/95_years_ago_in_one_weeks_time_wall_street/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.011897,0.85,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'calls', 'rocket', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss']",0.94
T,1nsa2sl,investing,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help. You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up. To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet. The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints. Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in. Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me. Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy) Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",163,133,2025-09-27 23:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.321598,0.85,$T,0.8,[],['earnings'],0.9057142857142856

T,1nulltc,wallstreetbets,Commercial Real Estate (Offic Focus) Analysis,"Analysis of Commercial Real Estate Markets (Working Draft) Originated: 02/01/25 10:27 am CST Last edit: 02/18/25 3:14 pm CST Authors note: I've been holding on to this for a couple months; after getting exactly 0 job interview (and being correct on the first hypothesis), I wanted to share with y'all in hopes that you may profit. Primary Hypothesis (moderate-strong confidence): The commercial real estate market is potentially entering a more turbulent period. Despite the strong economic recovery since 2020, the commercial real estate space has continued to struggle, particularly office space. As monetary conditions remain relatively tight, it is possible that mortgages written on properties in a low-interest rate environment may struggle to be refinanced; this may be exacerbated by workflow trends, increased vacancies, and stagnating fundamentals Secondary Hypothesis (moderate-weak confidence): The insurance industry largely prefers to reinvest premiums in fixed-income and interest bearing assets. As we have transitioned from a low-rate environment to a high one, I anticipate that any risks associated with low-yield instruments held on balance sheets have been properly hedged by now.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) However, with an increased cost of replacement materials due to elevated inflation/wages and increasing prevalence of natural disasters, I believe that underlying market fundamentals may have shifted; the underwriting process is becoming more challenging. In the pursuit of greater returns (and based on personal/quantitative analysis), I believe this industry may be seeking out returns in a manner that is sub-optimal. Tertiary Hypothesis (weak confidence): As banks have shied away from lending, private credit, private equity and non-banks have stepped in to fill the gap in lending. This tends to be less regulated, and may be implicated in the above referenced. \*I will probably ignore the last hypothesis for now. **Initial Data:** [Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/zya7ce5shcsf1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=520736582f5944d516723cdf9c4fe3fe1b2106b2) [Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/uc3ilg2vhcsf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=401b3c794e24b3727feb095a4d00f30d27022011) Fred Data: Figure 1 shows the total amount of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by all commercial banks through Q4 2024.[\[2\]](#_ftn2) Figure 2 shows the annual change of CRE loans through Q4 2024.[\[3\]](#_ftn3) Comparing the two, the percentage annual change became positive in Q4 of 2012, experienced (at least two) local peaks in Q1 2015 and Q3 2022, and has been below single digits in the last two quarters (2024 Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%). A critical component of loan origination is the Federal Funds Rate. Below, a table that includes the total value of these underlying loans, 3 months pre/post the calendar month in which the Federal Reserve changed the direction of interest rates: || || |Date|Amount ($B) or rate shift|Change ($B)|% Change| | 9/1/2015|1734.044| | | |12/17/2015|rate increase|97.746|5.636881| |3/1/2016|1831.790| | | |5/1/2019|2230.241| | | |8/1/2019|rate decrease|63.294|2.837989| |11/1/2019|2293.535| | | |12/1/2019|2320.046| | | |3/3/2020|rate decrease|64.232|2.768566| |6/1/2020|2384.278| | | |12/1/2021|2531.718| | | |3/17/2022|rate increase|129.685|5.122411| |6/1/2022|2661.403| | | |6/1/2024|2998.333| | | |9/18/2024|rate decrease|8.457|0.282057| |12/1/2024|3006.790| | | This would seem counter-intuitive: when interest rates rise, the magnitude of change over a +/- 3 month period is greater than the magnitude of change when interest rates fall.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) There are at least two (or more) likely explanations for this: 1. In an economic environment where rate increases are warranted, lending activity is elevated. When interest rate decreases are warranted, lending activity is depressed. 2. When interest rate increases are expected, origination's are increased in anticipation. When interest rate decreases are expected, originations are delayed in anticipation. I have also analyzed this 1 month pre/post (not included): a similar pattern exists and may be included in further versions. Market depth: According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[\[5\]](#_ftn5), the Commercial Real Estate Market was valued at $22.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Back then, banks and thrifts held the majority of the $5.9 trillion debt (50%), followed by Government-sponsored enterprises(17%), insurance companies and securitized debt (approximately 12% each). According to Statista, the total in 2025 is expected to be $25.79 trillion.[\[6\]](#_ftn6) According to Janus Henderson, the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market is worth approximately $1.7 trillion as of Q4 2024. https://preview.redd.it/56lykeo0icsf1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf1c5fe061270bacbd55522fb4e338c48984a **Background (CRE/Office emphasis):** The data suggests that the United States remains in a period of economic expansion. Through Dec. 2024, the benchmark indices have gained more than 50% in two years. However, recent GDP growth has slowed in the most recent quarter (2.3% Q4 2024 vs. 3.1% Q3 2024).[\[7\]](#_ftn7) The author of this document is restraining this document to a specific segment of the macroeconomic picture: commercial real estate. For example, a recent article from Commercial Real Estate news states that there was 5.8 million sqft of negative absorption in the most recent quarter, with 57 million sqft for FY 2024. National vacancy for office space sits at 20.9 percent, up from last years 19.4 percent.[\[8\]](#_ftn8) 49 out of 93 office markets recorded negative absorption in the latest quarter.[\[9](#_ftn9) The entire space has approx. 5.46 billion sqft of space. Average asking rent was $38.20/sf, up from $37.67/sf a year earlier, representing 1.4% increase in rent overall.

I found a company listed as the Texas Hedge Fund Association listed at 1700 Pacific Ave, Dallas, TX, 75201. I went in, talked to security and went to the listed suite #4100; completely vacant. I went back to the security desk at the front and asked for directions to the 14^(th) floor; that floor was vacant as well (see below). In total, out of the 49 floors in this skyscraper, 20+ were vacant.

I suspect the A class rating was obtained through renovations, so would anticipate that it gets relegated to “B” in 2026. **Texas Real Estate Investment Association Pitch:** I decided to attend an employment/investment pitch held in Dallas, TX. The final two hours being devoted to commercial real estate; the analysis of the speaker was that we were going from a “hot” residential market to a “lukewarm” one. Commercial real estate was were the “big money” was to be made. Return on investment was projected to be 100% over a five year period, with a standard LTV said to be 70% and a typical rent increase of 10% year. At the end, the presenter was asked by the author about office space: “We don’t invest in any office space, a lot of those properties are selling for $.40 to $.50 on the dollar”. The author was then talking to a broker seated nearby. Through the conversation, the broker shared that they work as a lender with various insurance companies; with customer premiums (and the lack of payouts through claims), investments were being made in commercial real estate properties. These were largely non-securitized, so they did not have to reference the SOFR benchmark. **Demographic Change and Building Forecasts:** For this portion of analysis, I am planning to compare demographic changes for metropolitan areas and CRE vacancy/construction (in progress).

Loan origination and loans held for sale are also starting points, but imperfect. If this were to be of material impact, I would expect this to appear (after the fact) in credit profiles. Pre-arranged revolving credit agreements may be a fruitful starting point as well if worst case scenarios are assumed. **Is this temporary? Are we at the end of a cycle?** My inclination is no, and that the real impacts well be felt in the coming quarters. **How can one potentially profit from this?** There are multiple ways. My starting point is trying to find regional banks most exposed, non-bank lenders that may be extending loans on properties where the fundamental and market values are different, and (hopefully) analyzing CMBS tranches in more detail to understand if the property loans that underly them are actually as sound as stated. .

T,1o9a45w,stocks,Is Robinhood Gearing Up for Another Big Move Ahead of Earnings?,"As someone trying to execute my first stock trade on a UEX, i decided to check through so many to see the one i think i can go for as trial. I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification. After i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2. I also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges. Overall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence. I’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

T,1o448dp,ValueInvesting,Paper money and stocks have no real value nowadays,"Trump can literally tweet and crash the entire market. But that is not even the worst part. People noticed that about 30 minutes before Trump’s tweet, someone shorted Bitcoin and made 88 million dollars. Are we entering times when money and stocks have literally no value? It has always seemed to me that when I invest in a stock, I am supposedly buying part of a company. But suddenly, if everything stops working and the world is burning, it has literally no value. I think Trump is manipulating the stock market and turning investing into a casino, something that does not make sense and is not based on real value, because his tweets can crash the market. I guess we are entering times when the value of the dollar and paper money will decrease. They can regulate the dollar’s value by printing more money or cutting interest rates. It is the same with stocks. Influential people, those around big companies and politics, are doing insider trading and you cannot stop them. When I buy any stock for 10 000 dollars, I do not feel like I am buying something valuable or safe. I feel like I am giving away my money with the fear that I might not get it back for nothing. Honestly, if I buy Nvidia stock for 10 000 dollars, am I really part of that company? Do they treat me with respect? No. I am just giving them money, hoping to grab a small piece of the cake and sell the stock for a gain, money I can later exchange for real assets like food or a home. These stocks are useless. They are basically a scam, but it works, so we all play the game. I think the stock market is evil. It is a way to multiply money easily, as if money is poured into a void. If the stock market did not exist, people would invest their money into creating businesses, building houses, manufacturing, and production that actually create tangible returns, real value, not something made from thin air. You may agree or not, but it is the truth. I hate that I also play this game, because it gives me money, yet there is so little real value in it. As I said, I buy top company stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. And what does that mean? Nothing. I do not own anything. I am just a small player that does not matter to those companies, a mouse trying to grab a crumb and run away. If the whole market tanked and I was left with those stocks, they would be useless, as useless as paper money that can be easily manipulated. Bitcoin was supposed to be the asset resistant to financial manipulation. But it is a meme asset, one tweet from Musk can move it. I think Trump hates the stock market and manipulates it with his tweets to push people into investing in real value, manufacturing, new businesses, infrastructure, food, and housing. I think that might be the future. Paper money will devalue, stocks will become worthless paper, and real value will lie in tangible assets homes, skills, art, people, food, and manufacturing. I think Trump is tanking the stock market because it is his way of bringing manufacturing back to America to be able to compete with China. Rich billionaires pour their money into stocks and create no real value. They just multiply money without effort or producing anything of real worth. The stock market has a huge influence on the small amount of manufacturing left in America. If I did not have money in the stock market, I would be happy to see that flawed system crash to the bottom. Buying stocks is not true investing. You do not produce any value. I'm poor, but I give away my money to financially support billion dollar companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and others. This is so ridiculous. I think if the dollar devalued or if the stock market tanked, it could actually be positive for society. People forget that stocks and money are just useless paper that don’t improve your life. Real value lies in tangible assets: homes, properties, medications, people, connections, metals, gold, copper, coal, wood, water, and so on. If no money existed, we would all hoard in other words, invest in water, toilet paper, wood, trees, coal, petrol, milk, fruits, food, homes, and other tangible resources. And that is how it should be. It would reduce poverty if everyone focused on producing tangible assets instead of paper stocks. There are enough resources for everyone to have a house and food. But evil people invented the stock market and paper money and made us believe it had real value, blocking access to the resources we need to survive. If everyone had houses and food, no one would work for companies nine to five their whole life until retirement. That's why they need the stock market. It's basically a black hole to throw your extra money into a void that doesn’t produce any value, keeping the poor poor and making them constantly work for rich. A stock market crash and dollar devaluation could actually be good for society because it would shift focus toward producing real value. That's why, if we want to fight billionaires and work toward being truly rich( having a home, food, and not working our whole lives as slaves )we have to ditch paper money. Billionaires control us with it. Working people should not touch money billionaires touch and have separate currency. Instead, we should pay with real value, skill for skill. I stand for a system where you do something for me, I do something for you, in exchange like it worked naturally in ancient times. Toilet paper has more real value than the stocks I hold. In a monetary system crisis, I would hoard toilet paper because it is more valuable than 100 virtual shares of some company, they may generate profit or not, but my ultimate goal is to sell those stocks, exchange them for money, and buy assets like toilet paper that improve my life.",0,62,2025-10-11 19:18:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o448dp/paper_money_and_stocks_have_no_real_value_nowadays/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.050035,0.85,$T,0.6,[],"['rally', 'support', 'profit', 'insider trading']",0.7228571428571429

T,1nshls6,ValueInvesting,Freeport McMoRan Accident and Valuation,"Last week Freeport stock dropped more than 20% due to an accident in their Grasberg mine in indonesia. While I do understand the implications (2026,2027 lower production) are negative for the company, I don’t see why the stock dropped by so much. 1) Usually mining (and oil) companies are valued with respect to their reserves and their cost to produce these reserves. So something like Reserves x (Commodity selling Price - Break Even Commodity Price). The accident at their mine will not change their reserves there. Of course there will be some extra costs which can be reflected in the Break Even Commodity Price of the Company (it will be increased), but I cannot believe it to be so high, that it justifies the drop we saw last week. 2) Copper Markets. No matter which source you take (BHP report, IEA Report), until 2050 there will be a massive undersupply of copper. The main reasons are declining ore head grades, almost no new discoveries and new permissions for mines takes ages (e.g. Resolution Copper for Rio and BHP is now more than 25 years in the permitting process). So if there is some supply demand imbalance here, prices are likely to rise (gold-copper-ratio also suggest that but it is not based on fundamentals). This is now somewhat of a paradoxon. When Freeport cannot pull out their copper out of the ground now, but only later when prices are (imo) much higher, and then Freeport has even higher ore Grades in 2-3 years, they make much more money than, than they lose know (OK, I do understand that there is uncertainty about that and you need to discount the future and such, but this is like a 20% risk discount which I think is irrational). 3)According to Goldman Analyst (I think it was them, but I could be wrong), due to this accident the copper supply decreased by 3% and now the world switched for a surplus to a deficit of copper. In the Barrons article it was written, that the same absolut amount of dollar which were lost in freeports market cap were gained in the market caps of BHP Rio and Glencore (because they are the largest copper producers) and will gain market share. Now, when in 2-3 years this mine comes online again with its 3% worldwide production rate (assuming everything else stays the same, I don’t think there will be more copper so the market share will be at least 3%, most likely more, see 1)). This market cap switch should be reversed, so Freeport will gain the market share it lost again. Possible returns: While mining is not the classical Buffett and Munger play, I do think this is a value opportunity with a great entry point now. Copper is finite and demand will outstrip supply in the coming decades. After a drop of 20%, you will need a gain of 25%, so just waiting for Freeport to make their mine run again in the next 3 years, will give you 25% return over a period of 3 years. Of course I looked much more deeply in their annual reports and such but I don’t think it is relevant for this investment case. I will just say, they have 23 million ounces of gold at 1600$, and 97 billion pounds of copper at 3.25$/lb. So just looking at market prices of copper and gold right now, and making the math I described in 1), gives you the long term outlook. Looking forward to a discussion.",7,16,2025-09-28 06:52:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nshls6/freeport_mcmoran_accident_and_valuation/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.291848,0.85,$T,0.6,[],['market cap'],0.7057142857142856

T,1oc122k,ValueInvesting,Apple Just Added $1.4 TRILLION Since April. iPhone 17 Mania Is Real,"Apple just had one of those market days that makes everyone stop and ask the same question, is it time to invest in Apple now? The stock surged to an all-time high, flirting with a $4 trillion valuation as investors piled in on signs of strong iPhone 17 demand. What looked like another headline rally actually revealed something deeper: a company still capable of compounding earnings and investor trust, even at historic scale. **Timeline of Today's Events:** * 10:36 AM - Cablefxmacro reports Apple shares up 3.1%, marking the first record since December. Early buyers jumped in after whispers of strong iPhone 17 preorders. * 10:38 AM - Investingcom confirms Apple hits a new all-time high at $260.20. Social media chatter picks up, and retail traders follow the momentum. * 11:11 AM - Kobeissi Letter points out Apple is up 55% since April, adding $1.4 trillion in market cap. It’s a staggering figure that reminds people why Apple remains Wall Street’s comfort stock when the world feels shaky. * 12:20 PM - Yahoo Finance reports iPhone 17 sales are outpacing the previous model in both the U.S. and China. The data hits right as skepticism around consumer demand was fading. * 12:59 PM - Reuters says Apple is nearing a $4 trillion valuation as institutional money starts to flow back in. * 1:54 PM - Investingcom highlights Apple’s 4.2% jump to a new record. Analysts note that the buying looks disciplined — based on earnings and product data, not just momentum. * 2:16 PM - The Wall Street Journal confirms another intraday record tied directly to stronger iPhone 17 launch numbers. * 3:10 PM - Seeking Alpha reports Apple approaching $4 trillion, calling it a renewed vote of confidence in the company’s product cycle. * 3:40 PM - A live YouTube finance stream calls it Apple’s “first breakout of 2025,” linking the rally to both iPhone sales and excitement around Apple’s quiet AI ambitions. * 4:10 PM - Forbes announces Apple has overtaken Microsoft as the world’s second-most-valuable company. * 4:11 PM - Fast Company says the stock’s new high is “driven by a landmark product,” reinforcing how Apple’s innovation engine still dictates market tone. * 5:02 PM - Investopedia notes Apple’s record close and strong start to the iPhone 17 cycle. * 5:50 PM - Investor’s Business Daily highlights how Apple’s surge helped lift the entire market toward record levels. * 6:25 PM - Reuters closes out the day confirming Apple is within striking distance of becoming only the third company in history to reach $4 trillion in market value. In my opinion, today’s rally isn’t just noise. Apple generates over $100 billion in free cash flow annually, carries more cash than debt, and keeps shrinking its share count through buybacks. iPhone 17’s success proves the brand’s pricing power and customer loyalty remain unmatched.",136,97,2025-10-21 02:22:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oc122k/apple_just_added_14_trillion_since_april_iphone/,2025-10-23 09:08:11.999744,0.7999999999999999,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'earnings', 'rally', 'breakout', 'market cap', 'eps']",0.9342857142857142
T,1o0nbbd,stocks,"Tesla prices Model Y standard below $40,000, debuting more affordable vehicle","Tesla has priced the Model Y below $40,000, the website shows. The company also announced a new version of its full self-driving supervised technology Tuesday morning. Over the weekend, Elon Musk’s company shared a teaser clip featuring a logo-emblazoned, spinning component that could be anything from a wheel cover to a fan or turbine. The clip ended with the numbers “10/7,” indicating Tuesday’s date for the reveal. Tesla posted a second clip to X on Sunday showing the outline of a vehicle’s headlights in the dark. Shares climbed 5% Monday as the buzz grew online over what the announcement would be. Investors expect a reveal of Tesla’s stripped-down, lower-cost Model Y, but are also hoping for updates on the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years. Or it could be something else. The company hasn’t released a new model vehicle for sale since it began shipping the Cybertruck, its angular unpainted steel pickup, in late 2023. Musk originally promoted the Cybertruck at an “unveiling” event in 2019, where his demo went awry and he shattered a window. The Cybertuck never achieved the level of popularity of Tesla’s Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUVs and has been the subject of at least eight voluntary recalls in the U.S. With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car busine*s*s. The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. But it’s also due to an aging lineup and increased competition from companies including Volkswagen and BYD. In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, “We, Robot” event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000. As of the company’s second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production. At an event in late 2017, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to “fly,” and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor. Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade. The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like Alphabet’s Waymo and Baidu’s Apollo Go. In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla’s Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they’ve yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots. Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. It’s now up 12% for the year. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September.

NEE,1nyxe6e,stocks,"Electricity and coal stocks: NEE, NRG, VST, BTU, CNR, and XLU","Regardless whether we are in the recession or pre-bubble era or not, the market seems to continue focusing on AI, drone, quantum computer and a few other topics. There are many news articles about the energy demand and soaring electricity costs. In the meantime, Trump wants to bring back manufacturing to the U.S. and recreate the steelmaking and shipbuilding industries, among others. All those need electricity, and Trump is not a fan of solar or wind. Nuclear power takes much longer time. It turns out the electricity companies can be separate between regulated entities and merchant-heavy firms. The latter one is free to expand and negotiation any power deals, while the former may require regulatory approval. The merchant-heavy or hybrid ones are mostly NEE, VST and NRG. I also looked at options for all, which turns out to be 40% implied volatility at least. I bought some NEE and NRG options anyway, especially because NRG reached a deal earlier this year to buy 13GW capacity. One other key candidate is XLU, which is an utility index with 15% implied volatility. I am heavily into the XLU call options through March 2026. As we can see from the recent PG&E news, even regulated entities may have a positive price movement. Coal is such as tiny industry. Thermal coal firms such as BTU and CNR are performing well. Metallurgical coal firms such as HCC is lagging. There are also some LPs such as ARLP and NRP. I wonder whether I should buy some leap calls on those super-low IV ones. Another weird animal is called XFIR, which seems to be a renewable energy LP diverted from NEE. I am still reading materials about this one.

T,1nxc0wc,financialindependence,AMA + (6 month update) Taking a gap year / sabbatical from Big Tech,"(x-post) Hi Folks, I wanted to give the community a 6 month update on my sabbatical/career break. Lot of context is in these three posts ([original](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1hoqn2a/taking_a_gap_year_sabbatical_from_big_tech/),[ first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1iwwm5y/update_taking_a_gap_year_sabbatical_from_big_tech/), [3 month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChubbyFIRE/comments/1lb2uhj/3_month_update_taking_a_gap_year_sabbatical_from/)), but here’s some TLDR; * Previously Engineering Manager in Big Tech, low 40s, Bay Area, sole earner in family of 4 with young kids, * 15+ years working in Tech, burnt out, didn’t see much hope for progress, so quit to take a break instead of jumping to new job right away * Not fully retiring as we still rent, and prefer to buy a home somewhere to “settle down” and that somewhere cannot be bay area at this NW if I retire **Finances:** With the recent stock market craziness, we officially hit 6 Million USD (I quit at 5.7M). It’s funny that even with 6 effing million, I don’t feel secure in the Bay Area. We are averaging 17k/month in expenses (including rent). Wife makes \~2k/month, so we are netting at 15k/month which seems like doable for a while. **How I spent the 6 months?** * First month was very productive. Attended lot of events/meetups, took a course on AI etc * Next 1.5 months were slow. Family got sick one by one * Next 2 months were summer break. Spent the whole time with kids. We did a lot more local trips this year than in any past summer + one short fly-out trip. I also cooked a lot and did some major home organization. * Last 1.5 months were not so great. I will talk about that next **The Bottom and the Swim Up** Once kids went back to school and their routine started (1.5 months back), I found myself with a ton of time and no plan on how to use that time. I drifted aimlessly through the days, from TikTok to YouTube to something else. I did some house cleaning, cooking etc along the way, but there was no purpose, no major responsibility to fill the time. On top of it, most of the friends circle is unusually busy. Most of them are in tech and the industry is going through a squeeze. Everyone is always stressed and running on fumes, so I wasn’t able to socialize much either. For a while I planned an international trip. Spent days researching locations, what to do etc and researching best ways to use my credit card points to snag a good deal. Scoured subreddits like [r/awardtravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/). But I finally realized that I cannot do long trips. I couldn’t leave the family alone at home and just take off. My wife has a new job and is very busy, which means I need to stay home to help out if I can. The realization that I have all this free time, but I cannot travel freely … kinda made life further depressing. My wife noticed and had a “talk” with me. That intervention was a huge blessing. I hated it, but it made me realize that I am wasting my precious free time. I accepted that I cannot take long vacations, but we agreed that I can do short weekend trips. So I did one, which I loved. I also organized my life a bit. Started jotting down how I ideally want to spend my free time and then started tracking how I am actually spending it. This was huge. For the last few weeks, I have finally: exercised daily, meditated daily, eaten healthy, gone for a walk every evening after dinner, started taking piano lessons (and made good progress) and made (not significant, but) decent progress on my other goals. **Learning so far** The aimless drift was something many had advised to look out for. The advice was solid, but it’s really hard to prepare for with a busy life. Also I think you have to experience it to truly understand it. When I heard that advice, I always said to myself, it won’t happen to me. I had a long list of things to do, a huge bookshelf of unread books to read, a strong desire to get healthy etc. But modern life is so full of distractions, it is really really easy to zone out. So learnings: * Have a rough schedule for everyday. Not strict, but still a rough idea of what you will do every day. * E.g., today I knew I would be staying at home the whole day as I needed to pick up kids early from school. So I knew that morning would be busy with daily stuff: exercise, meditation, getting ready, breakfast, lunch etc. And once I picked up kids, I knew that I will do some writing and then take them out. So even though I didn’t do anything “major” today, it feels fine, as I didn’t drift aimlessly. I am not saying that aimless days are bad, but every single day being aimless will get onto your nerves. Some days are OK. * Have some routine. I know what I do in the morning and evenings, so the only free time is in the afternoon, which is much more manageable than if all three were unscheduled. * Have a list of projects you will be working on. Humans need projects. Something to work towards, something to strive for. I had a home improvement project that I am immensely proud of and loved doing. Now I am working on a self improvement project, which gives me purpose. **What’s next?** I am hoping that the next few months are better spent. We have a family trip planned during Thanksgiving, and will plan another for December break. I will likely do 1-2 short solo trips as well. I hope to make progress on my personal projects. I don’t feel ready to jump back to a job right away, so will re-evaluate early next year. We will decide next summer if we are ready to move to MCOL. **AMA** I am curious what else people may want to know, so I am opening this up as an AMA. This community and the other FIRE communities have helped me immensely so far so this is my way of giving back.

T,1nzpc2g,financialindependence,Hit $500K Net Worth at 29 — From Lower-Class Roots headed to Financial Independence,"Hello everyone, I (29, M) wanted to share a personal milestone with the FIRE community that I don’t really get to talk about with family or friends. Last week, I officially crossed the half-a-million net worth mark at age 29! 🎉 I come from a lower-class family, and my parents were never in a position to contribute financially to my education or investments. I also did not have a good GPA in high school and didn’t receive any scholarships coming out of it. Everything I’ve built since then has come from informed choices, consistency, and a lot of sacrifice. My first job as a teenager was working in custodial services, followed by an administrative assistant role while studying mechanical engineering in college. I started at a community college to keep costs low, and during my first year, I made a plan: I researched transfer scholarships and found one that could cover most of my tuition at a nearby university. I even reached out directly to the program coordinator 1.5 years in advanced and told her, “I’m going to have a high GPA and plan to transfer on this date. What do I need to do to earn this scholarship?” That planning paid off. I graduated with my A.S. in Mechanical Engineering (3.9 GPA), transferred, earned the scholarship, and finished my B.S.M.E. with a 3.8 GPA. Between multiple other scholarships, paid internships, and tutoring jobs, I managed to graduate debt-free and even had a net worth of around $20K by the time I finished school. To save money, I lived with my parents through college and commuted daily on a motorcycle, rain or shine. It was cheap on gas, and in my state, I didn’t even need insurance for it. After graduation, I joined a Fortune 100 aerospace company and continued to live below my means. Since 2019, I’ve been maxing out my Roth IRA Vanguard account every year, contributing to my 401(k) up to the company match, and investing the rest personally. I rent hacked a 2 bed / 2.5 bath townhouse, I rented out the extra room to a couple, which covered most of my rent. That extra savings allowed me to invest aggressively during the COVID market dip, which gave my portfolio a huge boost. Last year, I bought my first investment property, a 4 bed / 4 bath duplex. I live in one side and rent out the other, and the rental income covers most of my mortgage. I’m even considering renting out a room on my side to eliminate the payment entirely and create some cash flow. Over the years, I’ve also had to overcome major setbacks like layoffs, and at one point I had to completely rebuild momentum. But each challenge taught me something new about resilience and adaptability. Fast forward to today, with Tesla’s recent stock rally, my net worth officially passed $500,000! It’s been a long, challenging, and incredibly rewarding journey. That said, I’ve never believed in total deprivation. I’ve always kept a “fun money” fund from each paycheck to enjoy time with friends and travel occasionally. FIRE, to me, isn’t about missing out. It’s about being intentional with your choices and aligning them with your goals. To anyone out there grinding it out, it’s 100% possible. You don’t need a trust fund or a perfect background, just curiosity, discipline, and consistency. Thanks for letting me share my story. This community has always been a huge source of motivation, and I hope this inspires someone who’s just getting started. My goal is to hit $1,000,000 by the time I turn 35! For those who asked, here’s a breakdown of my compensation over the years: • **2019 (First job out of college):** $73K • **2023 (Before leaving first job):** $87K • **2023 (Started new role):** $110K • **2025 (Before layoff):** $122K • **Current role (landed a few months after layoff):** $106K",114,27,2025-10-06 17:22:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1nzpc2g/hit_500k_net_worth_at_29_from_lowerclass_roots/,2025-10-23 09:08:35.615345,0.7,$T,0.5,[],"['dip', 'rally']",1.0

He’s a nice guy, he’s actually married to someone I used to work with back at my first job. Anyway, he got me to open up an investment account for their offered mutual funds (GAIOX, AGTHX) Little did I know at the time, the funds he got me in came with high front end fees. The upside is they seem like a dependable asset but the downside is the fees and I’m not a fan of fees when I can invest in something similar with little or no fees. I stopped my weekly investments months ago. I’m sure that’s gotta be somewhat of his bread and butter so I’m not sure how that works moving forward with him, but I’m toying with the idea of liquidating those stocks and either investing them myself or using them for a down payment on a house which I find very important. At the time when I first talked to the northwestern guy I didn’t know much about stocks or the market (still learning) and figured it would be best to blindly trust someone to invest my money because that wasn’t my world.

UNH,1ns8te3,wallstreetbets,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K. Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right? Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early. One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in) I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week) I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time. There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further. Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.* * **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush: * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.* * **ChatGPT reduction in citations**: * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.* * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*. OpenAI doesn't want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with* [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-google-search-trial-774f4774?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi2Aepz4YfkUzHlyW43XKFw5jYgLonf0RqC-XMCO1XblHovzKcMOxODMv7rkOY%3D&gaa_ts=68e8ec3f&gaa_sig=aoxKHEAywLIAKYAhJQLXOxevRchLEJ2gA5pO3e7p5VMHy7uJWtgMMSjRJ6U0IHEz5ppiUJPdvwSLlSbFSJdOUQ%3D%3D)*.* * *We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia, but we still use it because it's useful. Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.* This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense. This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of. Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline. # 🕓Timeline of Events * 9/4: [Nepal bans](https://cpj.org/2025/09/nepal-orders-ban-on-major-social-media-platforms/) 26 social media platforms * 9/7: Reddit announces it is [sunsetting public chats](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/41918962981908-Changelog-October-7-2025) * 9/8: Start of Nepalese Gen Z [protests organized over Discord](https://www.newsweek.com/morocco-nepal-gen-z-is-using-discord-rise-up-10821410) * 9/9 Nepalese Gen Z protesters [burned alive](https://www.newsweek.com/wife-ex-nepali-prime-minister-burnt-alive-parliament-set-fire-live-updates-2126979) the Prime Minister of Nepal's wife * 9/10: RIP Charlie Kirk. Promptwatch notices a big drop-off on ChatGPT reddit citations. * 9/17: Reddit, Discord, Twitch, Steam invited to [testify in Congress](https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/) on the radicalization of youth. Massive swings on this day. * 9/18: RDDT peaks at $283 * 9/19-9/21: RDDT starts a seemingly healthy correction * 9/22: Trump declares ""[Antifun](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/)"" a foreign terrorist organization * 9/23: RDDT drops another 7.8% and closes at $237.45 * 9/29-10/1: RDDT drops from $245 to $202.60 while the rest of the market was breaking to new ATH * 10/8: RDDT bottoms out at 195.01 at 10:30am, 30 minutes after the originally scheduled 10:00am hearing. ""Antifun"" round table discussion led by Trump and other Republicans discuss. * 10/9: RDDT breaks out of the bull flag and begins its road to recovery # 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls. The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**. This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more. The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone. In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate. What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af. # 🔬Testing My Theory If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies. AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started. And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing. # 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout. There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing. With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event. After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀 # 😶‍🌫️Conclusion - Make Money Doing What You Love There isn't a more wrinkle-brain move than to make millions from my 16 years of redditing.

T,1o0gw6w,wallstreetbets,DD for Games Workshop (Warhammer),"*No ChatGPTs were killed in the making of this, my first DD. This is chiefly for UK investors but I think it's a decent stock for internationals too.* **Ticker:** GAW/[GMWKF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GMWKF/)/GMWKY **Market Cap:** 4.72 billion GBP, or 6.35 billion USD **Revenue:** 617.5 million (reported June 1, up 17.46% yoy). 828.9m USD. **EPS:** 7.99 **Why I'm Bullish:** **- Growth Potential from TV** Warhammer and Amazon have agreed to move ahead with a TV show based on the Warhammer franchise. In Dec '22 the deal was made, in Dec '23 they announced they had settled creative differences and locked in the deal, in Dec '24 Henry Cavill (obviously) announced via socials and interviews that the project was moving forwards, and that he would be acting and producing. It's now apparently still moving forward, though firm news may still be some time away. [Source](https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-says-its-contract-with-amazon-prevents-it-from-revealing-any-details-on-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-shares-promising-sounding-update-on-scope-and-scale) If this happens (and lots of money has already gone into it) then it could significantly expand the earning power of the already popular franchise in a similar style to Game of Thrones or even, dare I say it, the LOTR movies. That's a long shot and it will be some time away if it ever happens, but the potential is there, and if we start getting news, then the vibes-based market will push the price up fast. Major expansion opportunity. **- GAW is also a good hedge; it's profitable; it pays dividends** Everyone ursine expects a market dump at some point, but GAW's not some shitty SPAC that will lose 80% of its value overnight. This is a very profitable company that offers a decent dividend (2.4%) paid quarterly. As a UK company it also offers some protection against fluctuations in the value of the USD that most of us have 90% of our money wrapped up in. Just in case the market comes to its senses at some point in the future, maybe. Eh, it probably won't. **- Growth Potential in General** Warhammer has expanded in popularity steadily. This is a google trends search for the term over the last ten years: https://preview.redd.it/n7kyryau8ptf1.png?width=2885&format=png&auto=webp&s=68eb0a436022c2ab552d2e3d758bb356a53c5d30 It's almost at peak popularity right now, and it's been expanding out into novels, comics, and the aforementioned tv show/film. The franchise had a crossover with MTG, too. **- Current Dip / Insider Buying** It's a good time to buy, relatively speaking. The stock recently hit ATH of 166.42 GBP, and has since dipped to 143.90. This dip is apparently based on profit-taking, not some fundamental problem (unless it's one which has yet to be announced). If there is some problem, then CEO Kevin Rountree is unaware of it, as this year he purchased 381k worth of stock at a price of 163 a share. The stock is currently at 143. \- **Downsides** Well, there's the distinct risk of the Amazon deal falling through, and the stock is slightly pricey without it in traditional terms. It also probably won't double overnight, it's a long-term hold which offers steady returns, if that's what you're into. If Russia nukes England then it'll be worthless, I guess. UK companies typically grow slower than US (although GAW has had very decent growth over a number of years). That's all I've got, but I'm sure someone will come up with some more in the comments. **TLDR** Little toy orcs are cool, and so is Henry Cavill. Insiders are buying, the stock is very profitable, and they're trying to expand their market through TV and film. There's also a dividend so you can get some useless crumpet money every three months. **Positions** I started buying at 114 and haven't stopped since, currently have a little over 10k USD of my wife's hard-earned money invested. Hopefully she will not become the next Nana of WSB. https://preview.redd.it/kzcv2wkicptf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdc692d9c6f97885b45ffdd1fcec9bf0cf7c6cd8",35,51,2025-10-07 14:49:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o0gw6w/dd_for_games_workshop_warhammer/,2025-10-23 09:06:38.696636,0.55,$T,1.0,[],"['bull', 'dividend', 'dip', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.84
JPM,1odpohp,stocks,Teladoc (TDOC) Earnings 10/29 -- Turnaround Incoming,"Greetings. I've been watching Teladoc for about 9 months, time to share my findings. I made some higher buys early in the year and have averaged down to 5000 shares @ 8.50. Teladoc is not just some leftover garbage from the pandemic. This is a growing international company (active in 130 countries) that offers solutions across a broad range of healthcare both for providers, patients, and enterprise customers. Telehealth and this company ARE the future. The same way streaming killed Blockbuster. The same way Amazon killed Sears. With healthcare, it will be more like how rideshare has affected taxis. Legacy healthcare is going not going away and plenty of instances where in person visits are required, but there are many instances that will gravitate to telehealth. There are already companies that can use your own smartphone camera to diagnose strep throat with around 92% accuracy. Technological advances such as this are going to continue to move us away from a healthcare service model that has not changed much in the last ~75 years. Telehealth can reduce unnecessary ER visits and do it at a lower cost to patients and insurers. Healthcare costs in the US are out of control and telehealth is continually looked at as an option to reduce costs of service. Medicare & Medicaid are expected to continue utilizing telehealth. COVID Era Telehealth provisions have already been extended twice. That portion of the bill to re-open the government has bipartisan support. Healthcare costs and specifically insurance premiums are going to be a huge focus of discussion in the next month. Telehealth will be a part of that discussion. Share Price $8.30 TDOC Annual Sales are around $2.6 Billion. Market cap $1.5B--Try to find another stock with over 2.5B in sales and a market cap less than 1.6B! I don't believe there is one. TDOC has 100 Million active users across 130 countries in 40 languages. One simple justification for a higher valuation is that you simply could not build what this company already has for 1.5B. Free Cash Flow around $185 Million. Cash on hand is around $600M Debt is also around $600M (due in 2026 and 2027--IIRC) They retired $500M in debt with cash in Q2. They secured a $300M revolving line of credit from JPM a couple of months ago. Golden Cross activated. 50 day MA: 8.03 200 day MA: 7.64 Short interest is ~14% of the float with ~3.5 days to cover. Not much of a factor here. Citron (🤮) has shared some positive releases on this stock over the last 6 months. Price targets have also been raised. Most recently was Citigroup up to $10.5. If you've made it this far maybe you've looked at a chart. It doesn't look good. This stock got way ahead of itself during the pandemic. And then they wasted a HUGE sum of money to buy Livongo and their earnings have been getting smoked by goodwill write-downs ever since. Competition and churn in their online therapy division ""Betterhelp"" led the company to slight revenue decline for several quarters. A recent acquisition, ""Uplift"" allows Betterhelp to accept insurance now. It had previously been cash pay only and patients were not sticking to the service. Uplift should patch the leaky bucket at Betterhelp and stop the revenue decline there. Integrated Care and Chronic care monitoring services are experiencing growth. Those segments of the business have led the charge of the turn around. They've made at least 3 all cash acquisitions in 2025. Uplift Catapult Telecare (Australia) Additional new services coming online: --A new Employee Assistance Program, Wellbound, is launching in January 2026--(announced in July 2025). About Wellbound: ""The new program, purpose-built for the company’s employer and health plan clients in the U.S., leverages Teladoc Health’s unmatched scale, clinical product portfolio and consumer engagement expertise to help organizations create a powerful “on-ramp” for long-term employee wellness."" -- Virtual Sitter and Clarity -- AI solutions for in patient monitoring and healthcare worker safety. Clarity is new, focused on protecting healthcare workers from Violence. This definitely means they are going to say ""AI"" on the 10/29 earnings call, so it HAS to go up, right? Something to keep an eye on: There have been rumors that the UK's NHS is planning to re-vamp/launch a country-wide online health/hospital service. They will be partnering with existing telehealth companies to provide this service. It is not yet announced which companies they will use for this though. Positions: 5000 shares at $8.50 50 contracts X dates from November 21 2025 to Jan 2027 from at various strikes from $7.5-10. Earnings call on 10/29 should show continued turnaround.

T,1ocdk6m,wallstreetbets,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard. The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution. You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a >20% drop the next week. **The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:** A wise man once told me history is a flat circle. Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/). The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total). [Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a) Now, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls. If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26 GLD 500C option (the farthest OTM currently available) at the current price of 2.14 (market close 20OCT25): **Scenario 1 (1979-1980 Repeat) - GLD doubles to 800 by end of year: Option has $300 of intrinsic value; 14,300% return** **Scenario 2 (Partial Repeat) - GLD increases 50% to 600 by end of year: Option has $100 of intrinsic value; 4,760% return** **Scenario 3 (Continuing trend) - GLD increases 25% to 500 by end of the year: Option has estimated $10 of extrinsic value 2 weeks from expiration; 476% return** **Scenario 4: GLD doesn't increase that much: -100% return** Now, I spy the glint of gold in many of your eyes. But others are muttering among yourselves, “Yet another meme stock. Last time I played one of those, my wife's boyfriend grounded me for a week.“ But here is why gold is uniquely positioned for such a move: gold is a physical object that has served as a trusted store of value for literally all of recorded history. I'll bet almost everyone here has at least one grandparent who hoards precious metals like a geriatric dragon. As a result, many poor souls who've never even heard of meme stocks will plunge into this frothing storm without knowing the perils of speculative markets They don't need charts or a brokerage to buy gold; they just go to their nearest Coin and Jewellery store with their Wendy's paycheck. A second factor today is the sheer access to leverage that did not exist in the 1979's-1980s. Back then, no ETFs even existed. No GLD, no SLV, nothing. And you had to call your broker to place a trade. But today, any room-temperature IQ degenerate can YOLO their entire net worth into 0dte calls on margin at the touch of a button. We just live in an era of rapid and rampant speculation. So now, let me give you a little background on the state of gold in general. If your bored, you can just skip ahead to my positions and exit strategy. **Gold Distribution:** Across the world, there is only 216,000 tons of gold in circulation as of the end of 2024. Approximately half is held as jewelry which includes 34,600 tons and 31,000 tons held by Indian and Chinese households, respectively. Another 38,000 tons is held by central banks. 49,000 tons are held as bars and coins (including ETFs) and finally, 32,000 tons in other uses (industrial, etc).

While mining efforts are likely ramping up, this should not impact supply that much over the duration of our voyage. [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/research\/gold-demand-trends\/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024](https://preview.redd.it/rv3h9wq6zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4135b0c31f240f3bc13cfb6e5ffdec5b37e7e6) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-v0te84o9rgwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bed6835419fbf38ed1d44e180b263493cd0c18d) A greater risk for supply is for people to start selling their gold bullion or jewellery to take advantage of the high prices which is listed as Recycled Gold in the chart above. During 2024, this accounted for 1370 tons, but this will undoubtedly increase as the price of gold increases. In accounts of the 1979-1980 mania, there were suddenly many gold and silver buyers popping up near the end; the modern equivalent would be getting spam texts asking you to sell your silver and gold (like you get for houses currently). This will be a sign the end is near. I will also be monitoring headlines for news of mass retail selling of gold and silver, especially in places like India and China where the population owns a tremendous amount of gold.

The US has been unable to get spending under control and continues to spend like a drunken pirate on shore. While the US is highly unlikely to actually default, the government will print to meet debt requirements, devaluing the currency. If you knew that you would be taking an inflationary haircut on any of your treasury holdings, would you really keep as many? https://preview.redd.it/teqt2yrfzgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=605469cc135657a8d1d1e2fe6e2ee445b0180320 Another common talking point driving gold prices is that Central banks are buying lots of gold and several countries, notably Turkey, have laws which gives the central bank the right to buy any gold produced in the country at market prices. Overall, Central Banks bought over 1000 tons of gold in 2023 and 2024. Gold has increased to over 20% of all central bank holdings while US treasuries have fallen.

This currency would serve as replacement for the US Dollar for trade in a scenario where another hegemonic power did not arise. **Position and Sizing:** As an established pirate, my chest of booty has well over a million doubloons from plundering the land o’ Kohls. If GLD sinks down to Davy Jone’s locker, most of me plunder will remain safe. Don’t be blinded by your greed and wager your whole ship. You should be willing to lose any money that you put on this; but the asymmetry of this play makes it attractive to me.

No one every blew up their account from taking profits. My plan is to take out my cost basis when the position reaches between 4x and 5x value. From there, I plan on selling another tranche every time it doubles: 10x, 20x, 40x, 80x, and 160x. Here are some other exit conditions: \-Gold prices break down from the current trendline. For example, in premarket today, gold dropped 3%. I would say if we close below Friday's low (\~386), that would invalidate the bubble thesis. \-If there are news articles or social media posts about people selling gold en masse THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",383,179,2025-10-21 13:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ocdk6m/setting_sail_for_plunder_gld_dd_and_yolo/,2025-10-23 09:06:38.679788,0.5,$T,1.0,['GLD'],"['bull', 'calls', 'yolo', 'baghold', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss']",1.0
T,1nwinqk,ValueInvesting,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway may have scored a ‘genius’ win-win in $10 billion acquisition that may be the last big deal of his career - Fortune Magazine,"[https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-genius-win-acquisition-last-deal-career/](https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-genius-win-acquisition-last-deal-career/) By Jordan Blum Editor, Energy October 2, 2025 at 3:30 PM EDT The big move by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy the chemicals business of oil giant Occidental Petroleum for nearly $10 billion is a double win for Berkshire, analysts say, in Buffett’s potential swan song deal before retiring at the end of December. The Oct. 2 deal is the first-ever Berkshire announcement that quotes incoming CEO Greg Abel and doesn’t mention the current chief executive by name. The OxyChem business will operate as a strong stand-alone for Berkshire, while the deal should boost Berkshire’s nearly 30% ownership of parent Oxy because the Houston company will use the bulk of the proceeds to pay off the high debt load that’s dragged down its stock in recent years, said Doug Leggate, Wolfe Research energy analyst. “It’s genius. It’s certainly a win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own 30% of,” Leggate said. “It’s completely self-serving, it’s logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful.” The $9.7 billion, all-cash OxyChem deal is Berkshire’s largest since scooping up insurance player Alleghany in 2022. In recent years, Berkshire has focused on selling off stakes of its investments and is sitting on a whopping mound of almost $350 billion in cash. Leggate called OxyChem a steady potential cash cow that focuses on its growing chlor-alkali business manufacturing PVC (polyvinyl chloride) resin for piping, construction materials, medical equipment, and more. Its business largely moves with the housing market, which could soon benefit more from falling interest rates. “It’s a low-volatile, uncontroversial, niche business that has pricing power given the market structure,” he said. The 95-year-old Buffett announced his retirement plans in May, although Abel has long been tapped as his eventual successor. Abel, the longtime Berkshire vice chairman of noninsurance operations, praised the OxyChem deal and Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub in the announcement. “Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,” Abel said in the announcement. “We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire. We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental’s long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company’s balance sheet.” Berkshire did not immediately respond to interview requests. Specifically, Oxy said, it will use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and bring its principal debt below the $15 billion target it set following the late 2023 acquisition of Permian Basin oil producer CrownRock for $12 billion. Hollub said the deal helps Oxy focus on its core oil and gas business, especially in the booming Permian, while strengthening its financial position through debt reduction. OxyChem represents almost 20% of Oxy’s total pretax income, bringing in more than $1 billion annually. **The Berkshire-Oxy courtship** The intimate Berkshire-Oxy relationship dates back to 2019 when Oxy entered a dramatic bidding war with the much larger Chevron to acquire oil producer Anadarko Petroleum. Anadarko had chosen to sell to Chevron when Oxy came back with a larger $38 billion offer that included much more cash—too good for Anadarko to turn down. That offer only came to fruition when Hollub took a whirlwind trek to Omaha to see Warren Buffett and his Berkshire team. After a 90-minute meeting, Buffett committed $10 billion to finance the merger in exchange for preferred shares and a stake in the expanded Oxy. The agreements allowed Oxy to boost its cash offer to about 80% of the purchase price in its successful David-versus-Goliath bidding war against Chevron. Since then, Buffett has increased Berkshire’s stake in Oxy to more than 28%. But in the meantime, the big acquisitions left Oxy with a much greater debt load, especially going into the pandemic in 2020. Oxy barely survived the downturn, slashing its dividend from 79 cents per share each quarter down to just one penny. Since then, the dividend has risen back up to 24 cents—still much lower than in 2019. The OxyChem deal largely solves the debt problem, although Oxy won’t begin redeeming Berkshire’s preferred shares—and their 8% annual interest—until 2029. “In a world where crude \[pricing\] is softening, Oxy has too much debt. It’s unequivocal that it’s a good thing for Oxy to raise cash and pay down debt,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm. While Abel may already be in the dealmaking driver’s seat for Berkshire, Pickering said, “\[Buffett\] was the driver of the original Oxy investment, so I’m sure he was involved.” Pickering compared Berkshire’s likely double win for both OxyChem and Oxy to a “circular loop” like the booming AI sector’s recent investments in one another’s companies: “AI is in a circular loop where Nvidia gives money to somebody, who gives money to somebody, who gives it back to Nvidia.” The only problem for Oxy on Oct. 2, though, was its stock surprisingly fell by 7%. Oxy had outperformed the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF by about 2.5% this week through Oct. 1, largely baking in the deal before the Oct. 2 announcement. Oxy is selling its chemicals business at a bit of a discount when the broader petrochemical sector is near a cyclical trough. Pickering said there was some “sell the news dynamic” at play. But the sale also diminishes some hopes that Berkshire would buy Oxy in its entirety, potentially hurting the stock. “By buying these pieces, the odds that he’s going to buy it all have gone down,” Pickering said. A year ago, this reporter asked Hollub at what point Berkshire might control too much Oxy stock. Her response: “We would never consider it to be too much.”",218,24,2025-10-02 22:51:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwinqk/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_may_have/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.277694,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'support', 'merger', 'acquisition']",1.0
T,1np2c6p,ValueInvesting,"Men’s underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch — yahoo finance","Men’s underwear, cardboard boxes, and giant skeletons: Offbeat recession indicators to watch Unemployment and consumer spending can signal the direction of the economy. Some believe more nebulous data points hold clues too. Emma Ockerman Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:02 PM GMT+2 7 min read From Labubus **(1)** and men’s underwear to lipstick and skirt hems, signs pointing to or away from a recession are everywhere. Whether they’re accurate indicators of the economy's health is another matter. Here’s how recessions are actually defined: A committee with the National Bureau of Economic Research **(2)** that maintains a chronology of US business cycles pores over official monthly releases from government agencies, like employment and income data, to date periods that represent a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” That process can take a while. In June 2020, for example, the NBER declared the country had entered a recession **(3)** in February of that year — an unusually fast determination. In July 2021, the NBER said **(4)** the country had exited the recession in April 2020. **(5)** Otherwise, experts turn to other reliable, albeit unofficial, recession signs, including two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or the “Sahm rule,” **(6)** which finds the start of a recession occurs when the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more, relative to its 12-month low. Now, with consumer sentiment tanking, inflation ticking higher, the job market stagnating — and social media users speculating that short, bare nails **(7)** herald economic malaise — here are other less-than-traditional measures to watch. Cardboard boxes Cardboard box demand is sometimes seen as an indicator of economic health, since the majority of what consumers purchase touches corrugated cardboard. Here’s the not-so-great news: Right now, US box makers are cutting back on production, ** (8)** said Jadrian Wooten, an economist at Virginia Tech. Box shipments are also down. “I love this recession indicator, or I guess potential indicator, because it is such a common item that I think a lot of people take it for granted,” Wooten said. Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly used to track cardboard prices. **(9)** “The cardboard box industry is incredibly large — we’re talking close to $100 billion in revenue,” Wooten said. “What I always tell my students at Virginia Tech is that it’s four times as big as the NFL, and they hear about the NFL every day, on TV, on social media, there are video games about it. We don’t have that about the cardboard box industry. It’s so much more important.” Many US boxes are shipped abroad, and exports are expected to weaken amid trade tensions, **(10)** which could help explain lower packaging demand. US consumer spending, which has so far remained resilient, may also grind lower as prices rise, dimming the need for tons of shipments. Right now, the cardboard story is also one about capacity, Wooten said, with multiple plants being taken offline in the most dramatic cuts since the Great Recession. All of this taking place before the holiday shopping season is doubly concerning. “This is actually the peak time for the holiday season that we would expect to see ramp-ups in cardboard box production happening,” Wooten said. “That’s probably the biggest concern in terms of a pending recession: Companies are not ordering cardboard boxes to put their products in to then send to Target or Walmart for the holiday season.” If looks could indicate Americans have long sought to tease economic signals from fashion and style choices. It’s been said, for example, that skirt hemlines lengthen, natural roots start to show, men’s underwear goes unreplaced, and clothes grow more muted during an economic downturn. It’s also been said, however, that many of those “indicators” are far from reliable. The hemline index in particular has been debunked **(11)** — midi skirts trended in 2019, for example, when economic conditions were otherwise solid, and micro-mini skirts trended around the time the dot-com bubble burst. And it was Greenspan, again, who told NPR **(12)** that a dip in men’s underwear sales could be indicative of a troubled economy. But is it? “I cover Hanesbrands and Gildan, which both make underwear, and I can tell you that nobody at either company has ever told me that,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar. “Greenspan was totally blindsided by the economic crisis in 2008, so clearly his underwear indicator did not help him, did it?” Swartz added. During times of economic hardship, retailers may say consumers are becoming more “choiceful"" **(13)** or discerning in their purchases. “It doesn’t mean that they don’t spend, it just means that they aren’t necessarily spending on things as they would if the economy was in better shape,” Swartz said. The 'little treat' economy A few months after the 9/11 attacks — at which point the US was already in a recession — Leonard Lauder, then the chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, said ""when things get tough, women buy lipstick,” according to a Guardian report from the time. **(14)** ""In stressful times, many consumers are reaching out for those small indulgences that provide momentary pleasure,” Lauder said. This sentiment started being referred to as the “Lipstick Index,” and it somewhat tracks with the idea of today’s “little treat economy,” or the rise of people indulging in more affordable pick-me-ups (an iced coffee, maybe, or a cute keychain) as a form of self-care. “I don’t know that there’s any clear evidence that women decide to buy more lipstick because they feel bad about the economy or something like that,” Swartz said. “My opinion would be that when there’s a recession, people cut back on everything, and that probably includes lipstick.” More indicative of economic conditions, perhaps, is whether or not people are going out to eat, which is generally more expensive than cooking at home. And restaurant traffic is indeed on the decline, **(15)** with the cost of food away from home up 3.9% in the past year. **(16)** “You can also look at things like sales in discount versus sales in department stores,” Swartz said. “We’ve seen much stronger results from retailers like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and Ross compared to department stores. We’ve also seen weakness in the luxury space.” Giant skeletons Sean Bagniewski, a Democratic state representative in Iowa serving the Des Moines area, posited in a newsletter he sent in August that the apparent lackluster demand for giant, 12-foot skeleton sales at Home Depot could suggest economic rain clouds ahead. He has his own “Skelly” and noted that “there are lively Facebook groups that focus on this and other Home Depot Halloween items each season.” Despite retailing for $299, they often sell out fast when they hit stores. And, since Home Depot (HD) did not do a spring sale of Halloween decorations this year, Bagniewski told Yahoo Finance, it seemed likely that August’s decoration drop would generate a lot of interest. “Though I have one, I was curious to watch how the Skellies got snapped up when they were released at about 5:15 one morning earlier this month,” he wrote. **(17)** “In 2023, all of them were purchased within the hour. In 2024, all of them were gone by noon. This year, there were more than 3,000 that were still available on the Home Depot site 13 hours after they were released.” “That’s not as fancy as Greenspan economics, but I’d say it’s interesting anecdotal evidence that folks are feeling a pinch in their pocketbooks,” he added. A spokesperson for Home Depot said they couldn’t “share any sales specifics around any products,” though “we continue to see fans embracing Skelly into their Halloween collections.” As of the morning of Sept. 23, Skellies remain in stock. **(18)** Indeed, some commenters noted in a Facebook group devoted to Home Depot’s Halloween products that they had tighter budgets this year or were waiting for discounts, though others spent thousands of dollars on decorations. Still, Bagniewski sees red flags when families scale back on luxury items that make their kids happy. “If people aren’t buying those — and it’s been a hot-ticket item in past years — then that should be somewhat of a warning sign,” Bagniewski said.

Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40, ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic ) I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there.

The deal, which would be Berkshire’s largest since 2022, could come together within days, the people said. Houston-based Occidental is largely known for its oil-and-gas operations. The company has a market value of around $46 billion and already counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder. Occidental’s petrochemical division, OxyChem, manufactures and sells chemicals for use in applications including chlorinating water, recycling batteries and producing paper. The unit generated nearly $5 billion in sales in the 12 months ended in June. Assuming talks don’t fall apart, the OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals. In 2011, Berkshire acquired specialty-chemicals producer, Lubrizol, for close to $10 billion, including debt. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Occidental was in talks for a $10 billion deal to sell OxyChem, without identifying the buyer. The last major deal Berkshire did was in 2022, when it agreed to pay $11.6 billion to buy insurer Alleghany. Buffett, 95, got involved with Occidental in 2019, as Chief Executive Vicki Hollub was trying to outbid Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum. In a trip facilitated by Bank of America Chief Brian Moynihan, Hollub traveled to Nebraska to visit Buffett, whose company agreed to buy $10 billion of preferred shares in Occidental to bolster her $38 billion offer. Occidental’s fortunes have waxed and waned since then. The deal saddled the company with debt and attracted criticism from activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett doubled down as Icahn exited, eventually buying up roughly 28% of its shares. The company’s shares more recently have come under pressure with oil prices lower. Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash to pay down debt. As of August, it said it had repaid $7.5 billion of debt. Berkshire, on the other hand, has been sitting on a massive cash pile. The company’s cash and Treasury bills sat at a record $344 billion at the end of June, raising investors’ eyebrows. Buffett has said the company still prefers owning businesses, though has suggested that finding the right ones to buy can be hard. “Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Buffett wrote earlier this year.

The stock’s been trading sideways, sentiment flat, and a lot of investors have just moved on. But the last few weeks have been different.

In mid-September, several funds started adjusting their positions. Douglas Lane & Associates and Voya Investment Management trimmed exposure, but more funds were adding. Swedbank AB bought over 200,000 shares, Strs Ohio added more than 300,000, and Pacific Capital Partners disclosed a new $4.1 million position.

Reuters, FinancialJuice, and multiple trading outlets broke the news that PayPal and Google were partnering on a multiyear deal to power payments across Google Cloud, Ads, and Play. They’re also teaming up on AI-driven “agentic commerce.” PayPal shares jumped more than 2 percent that day on heavy volume. Rothschild & Co Redburn raised their price forecast the same day. * Sep 18, 2025 – Coverage snowballed. TechCrunch, Zacks, Investopedia, and Seeking Alpha all described the Google partnership as a breakout catalyst. Sundar Pichai even said he was “excited about teaming up with PayPal on AI shopping and payments.” The stock spiked after hours, breaking out of a long trading range. * Sep 22, 2025 – Kingstone Capital Partners disclosed a $3.5 million PayPal position. Options feeds picked up unusual activity in October puts, but sentiment stayed bullish overall. * Sep 23, 2025 – Seeking Alpha upgraded the stock again, publishing “PayPal: Agentic Commerce Inflection.” That upgrade capped off the strongest two-week run of positive coverage PayPal has had all year. * Oct 3, 2025 – PayPal announced a partnership with payments platform Gr4vy to expand merchant checkout options. It’s part of a broader effort to make PayPal easier to embed for merchants instead of relying on legacy checkout buttons. * Oct 5, 2025 – Two major headlines hit on the same day. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, crossed $1 billion in market cap after expanding its partnership with Spark, and the company signed a memorandum with DP World to streamline cross-border digital trade payments. That’s a big deal because DP World runs logistics networks that span 70 countries. It puts PayPal’s infrastructure into global trade settlement for the first time. * Oct 6, 2025 – PayPal launched a holiday promotion offering 5 percent cash back on Buy Now, Pay Later purchases, expanding BNPL to in-store retail. On the same day, filings showed HS Management Partners sold 220,000 shares, trimming its position by about 17 percent. The selling didn’t dent the price much, which suggests stronger underlying demand for shares. Between these headlines, the story started to shift from “PayPal is shrinking” to “PayPal is finally moving again.” The Google partnership gave it new relevance in AI and commerce. The stablecoin milestone proved real traction in digital payments. And the DP World collaboration put PayPal in a completely different lane trade and settlement, not just consumer checkout. The fundamentals still look too cheap for what the business produces. The stock trades around 11 to 12 times forward earnings, roughly half the fintech peer group. Free cash flow yield is near 10 percent, and the company still has a $5 billion buyback program running. Debt remains low, and earnings are expected to grow about 8 to 10 percent next year. What this all adds up to is a company that’s still printing money, expanding strategically, and regaining credibility while its stock price assumes nothing goes right. That’s the kind of setup value investors tend to look for where sentiment and fundamentals have disconnected. Most people stopped paying attention months ago, but September and October tell a different story. Institutions quietly accumulated, partnerships materialized, and the business delivered actual progress instead of talk. With markets at current high's, this stock looks like it has a lot of value at these price levels and look like a good risk reward play.",36,17,2025-10-07 00:52:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o00rzf/paypal_pypl_quiet_rotation_real_value/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.264633,0.5,$T,0.6,['PYPL'],"['bull', 'puts', 'earnings', 'breakout', 'volume', 'market cap']",0.9342857142857142

Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff. So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet. Here’s the kicker: * EBITDA = \~$418M * Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA * Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**. * Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh. Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday. So we’ve got: * Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around). * Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot. * A PE bidding war. * A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay. My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets** So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected. Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**. Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.** TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

T,1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better. However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it. When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value. After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years. From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500. Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations. Anyways here are the results: FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price? Probably not. Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs. That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding. Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels. For me this is a clear hold.",280,142,2025-09-27 10:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.323540,0.5,$T,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'rally', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.9285714285714285
T,1ocm7oj,ValueInvesting,$FNMA $FMCC IPO DD - Retirement Guide,"WSB banned me for trying to post this. $FNMA $FMCC “F2” “GSEs” “GAMC” FANNIE MAE - FREDDIE MAC DD. TLDR: the ultimate PDJT trade where you can make 10x your money in the next 2 months. If you want in, now is the time, if not, you’ll likely be reading about it later. Full disclosure: I am long both stocks and split the position between the two at 50/50. I and many others have owned these stocks for years knowing the right situation would come along where they unlock massive value for shareholders and the treasury. I will be skipping past a bunch of history that’s important as to how we got here but might not be entirely necessary to understand the investment thesis. Just some key points. FNMA / FMCC securitize and sell MBS, collect a fee, and they guarantee that payments will be made to investors of the MBS. They dominate the market and have virtually no competition. Back in 2008 FNMA FMCC were forced into conservatorship by Hank Paulson and the US Treasury under the threat that their failure would bring down the entire financial system. For those that studied the 2008 GFC more than just watching the big short, the twins aka the GSEs didn’t even need a bail out and Hank Paulson forced it on them. The combined entities received $187bn. Over the next 17 years, they have repaid over $300bn to the treasury but it has not been accounted for. The repayment equates to a ROI of 11% for the treasury. The over arching issue was that President 44 decided to enact the NWS (Net Worth Sweep) against the GSEs forcing them to pass every dollar of profit to the Treasury in the form of a dividend. These dividends/repayments were never deducted /accounted for from the amount loaned to them in 2008. 44 used the NWS and other parts of the GSEs to fund Obamacare. In the last year of 45s first term, he and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin stopped the net worth sweep allowing the twins to retain capital and work towards their capital requirements which once fulfilled allows them to exit conservatorship. The problem, the capital requirements were made to be arbitrarily high, and while the companies started earning and retaining capital, any net profit was now just being added to the value of the treasuries SPS Senior Preferred Stock. In other words, the companies have an approximately 180bn cushion underneath them now but the treasury has an outstanding authority stating that they can take all of it. Plus they own 80% of the common shares by way of penny warrants that they gave themselves for “saving” the GSEs. So today we have two companies that have massive cushions of capital, 65% Market Share, and profits that even the worst financial calamity couldn’t stop (see recent stress tests) The stocks trade at a fraction of their true value due to the overhand of the SPS or the claim that the government could take everything. Which sounds like something they would do, but isn’t what they will do. The stocks have rallied since 47 spoke about campaigning for the 2024 election and have been on a tear ever since he won. Going from Pennies to around 11-12 dollars today. But they aren’t even close to being done. 47 and admin have been dropping bread crumbs all year about their intentions to release the GSEs citing a $1T evaluation for a November stock offering. But the capital structure needs cleaned up, and the capital requirements need to be reset to reflect the most recent stress tests. They can obliterate shareholders of the common stock with the SPS and warrants and own >95%of the companies. Or they can write off the SPS as everybody knows that these two paid back all the money plus much more. The result of writing off the SPS would mean they just roll with their 80% stake via penny warrants and extract value that way by letting the market set the value of their stake. As an 80% stake holder, it makes all the sense in the world to cancel the SPS, and reset the capital requirements to 2.5%. Treasury Secretary Bessent recently in an interview said that he wants long term institutional holders and retail investors, and that all things would be in place for the GSEs success. At a $1T valuation their 80% stake would be worth 800bn. And As reported, They plan to sell 3-6% of their converted warrants to raise $30bn (biggest offering ever) The result would be a remaining stake worth $770bn mark to market, 30bn to the treasury general account (only 47 and Bessent can control) and they would receive 80% of the companies dividend flow (tens of billions per year) They could also loan against their stake to fund additional policy objectives which will help lock down winning the mid terms and other strategic objectives. I and many others see zero reason to obliterate shareholders here as it would result in less economic gain, lawsuits, and a political narrative that is heavily against the admin. They have done a good job of changing the narrative from fear to value as the government takes stakes in companies. This one is the strongest precedent setter yet and is very important to execute properly if they want to have a successful sovereign wealth fund that continue investments in strategic companies. The main characters here are 47, Bessent, Pulte and Lutnick who all bring a lot to the table. These companies have 7T in assets and gush cash. The admin has been talking about calling for a national housing crisis. A private F2 can materially bring down mortgage rates by backstopping the bid on the spread between the 10 yr and the 30 yr MBS, this spread is historically very high and could come down considerably a release from conservatorship. 47 also has been posting about merging them which would only add to their value and efficiencies, and ultimately cheaper mortgages for Americans. Although it’s yet to seen how he is going to accomplish this without congress. More on that later. It’s important to add that none of this requires congress and all the money that could be generated will be in the control of Scott Bessent and 47 by way of the treasury general account. This likely will be the seed capital for the SWF sovereign wealth fund as it was raised in a budget neutral way. The GSEs privatization and stock offering is 47’s ace in his pocket to lower mortgage rates, win mid terms, and finance all the his admin’s objectives (AI race, rare earth investments, digital asset accumulation in Budget neutral way, etc) It’s important to note that equity in mortgages is at a historic all time high and bringing down mortgage rates will cause a refinancing boom that will bring trillions into the economy. As far as home prices are concerned, normally with a lower 10 yr paired with a tighter 10 yr- 30yr MBS spread, you should expect demand to outweigh supply and home prices to rise. This admin obviously doesn’t want that as a result of rate cuts. However we are in an interesting time where manufacture housing is cheaper than the average home for sale. 47 has explicitly stated that GSEs need to get the home builders going and wants a lot supply. If he can jam a bunch of supply into the market at the same time, he can stabilize home prices if not drop them. If home prices drop and energy stays low, I foresee the inflation concerns falling apart as these two segments make up large parts of the inflation calculation and are real difference makers for everyday Americans. So we have memes from 47, interviews with all the main characters supporting this thesis, major investment funds with large stakes waiting for release. This is a deal where everyone can receive a windfall and the treasury can catapult itself forward on a list of admin objectives. A rare opportunity where what’s good for the government, is good for common share investors. I probably missed a bunch as I typed this out but hopefully anyone who read this far can understand the massive value unlock that’s coming. As of today, the capital requirements haven’t been changed and the SPS still remains looming overhead. Howard Lutnick was on recently stating that “listnen a deal will be made” My opinion is that 47 kept the SPS when he cancelled the NWS as a way to keep speculators from front running release knowing that they could get potentially obliterated with dilution. But now we are at the point where the admin is signaling that it will be written off hence why you see the share moving up. Understand that there are 1.2bn share of Fannie Mae alone and I think 600k of Freddie Mac. So all this year leading up to this point has been ups and down coming from news and then no confirmation from the admin. The result is the that 1.2bn shares have been moving from the hands of speculators/traders up 100s of percent to institutional/retail longs. The result will be a very tight float on IPO/uplist day. Bill Ackman is on record stating he owns 200m shares (only 100m reported) and other funds like Morgan Stanley, and capital group have accumulated large amounts as well. These trade and are for now manipulated on the OTC. I believe that under the Wild West veil of the OTC instituons have been able to suppress the price and quietly accumulate But that will soon come to an end when they uplist to NYSE or rumor has it TXSE. 47 has branded them as $GAMC and even teased acquiring the ticker $MAGA. He just put out a new commercial yesterday morning on Fox Business during his interview with Maria Bartiromo. We could do a whole separate post on the growth catalysts that these companies have staged but just know the government has been running them for 17 years and they have been making tons of money as is (approx 35bn a year). They both own 50% of CSS with is the securitization platform that handles all the GSE MBS flow. Pulte has been on record stating that they are changing the CSS to “US FINTECH” which hints that they will license the technology to the rest of the world. $ Imagine what they can do after release from conservatorship with 47, Bessent, Lutnick, and Pulte in charge. Release from conservatorship done right likely will revolutionize housing finance. Let me know what you guys thinks. Just trying to actually throw out a good idea for those who are looking for an opportunity that meets meme stock potential short term and all the value of a long term hold. If you want to learn more go to the FNMA FMCC exit subreddit or even better contact Bill Ackman’s presentation that he release in Jan. (Which he already came back out and said his estimates are too conservative.) Holding forever, but My price target is $50 by Christmas and $100 by end of January.

T,1nrvnxd,wallstreetbets,Upcoming OKLO Catalysts That Could Push It to $200+,"**TL;DR**: The biggest near-term catalysts for Oklo ($OKLO) are (1) Regulatory licensing filings with reduced fees now in effect, and (2) LOIs converting into binding PPAs with data centers/hyperscalers. DOE programs, insider alignment with Sam Altman/OpenAI, analyst coverage, and operational milestones round out the key drivers. Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. It reflects analysis and opinions based on publicly available information, and any price targets or scenarios discussed are speculative. Investors should do their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions. ⸻ **1. COL submission + reduced fees**: The most important inflection would be Oklo submitting its Combined License (COL) or amendment under Part 52. A formal filing or acceptance letter moves the company onto a clear regulatory track toward construction/operation, reducing uncertainty and drawing institutional interest. Timing is favorable: as of Oct 1, the regulatory body lowered hourly rates for advanced reactor reviews, cutting licensing costs and making a filing even more attractive. **2. LOIs → binding PPAs**: Revenue visibility is the other big catalyst. Oklo already has public agreements and LOIs with data center operators (including a 12 GW framework with Switch). The next step is converting these into binding PPAs or project-level offtake contracts. If a hyperscaler or large operator signs a binding deal, it would instantly validate Oklo’s commercial model and likely re-rate the stock. **3. DOE programs and pilot selection**: Oklo has been selected under DOE pilot initiatives, and further DOE funding awards, pilot milestones, or fast-track inclusions would be visible de-risking events. Federal recognition both improves credibility and makes financing easier. **4. Insider support (Sam Altman & OpenAI)**: Filings show Sam Altman’s Hydrazine Capital still holds ~3.15M shares. Beyond that, Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, which has been clear about the massive energy requirements to scale AI compute. In a recent blog post, he said OpenAI will soon announce energy partnerships and new financing ideas. With his dual role and financial stake, Oklo is a logical partner candidate. Any announcement connecting the two would be a blockbuster catalyst. **5. Analyst coverage shifts**: Goldman Sachs recently initiated at $117 PT while others like Wedbush sit higher at $150+. Coverage from major desks matters because it shapes fund flows, especially if sentiment consolidates more bullish. **6. Operational milestones**: Incremental updates- site permits, readiness assessments, procurement contracts, or construction financing- are less flashy but reduce execution risk. Analysts track these closely, and they matter for building institutional confidence. **7. Short-interest dynamics (secondary)**: Borrow availability for OKLO has been tight at times, which means positive headlines can spark outsized moves. Serious investors usually don’t trade on this, but it helps explain volatility and is relevant for tactical positioning. ⸻ If Oklo successfully executes on its near-term milestones; including regulatory licensing, binding PPAs, and partnerships with entities like OpenAI- some analysts and investors suggest that a price target of **$200+** could be achievable, reflecting the company’s long-term growth potential in the nuclear energy sector.

T,1nopc6h,ValueInvesting,Beyond NVO and LLY: Expanding Your GLP-1 Portfolio,"I think everyone here knows about Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO), and if you believe the bull case for GLP-1’s I’m just going to assume you see a lot of value in both. Their GLP1 drugs treat one of the most common ailments on earth, and yet they are beaten down while the market is at all time highs. However, I’m not going to be making much of a bull case for GLP1’s here, others have done that. This post is about identifying lesser known companies that stand to benefit from the bull case for GLP1’s coming to fruition, as well as international markets. Here is what you need to know: The biggest news I really hope you know as a GLP1 investor is that semaglutide’s patents expire (all of them) next year in Canada, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Mexico. This has been well known for a while so it's not a huge drag on NVO or LLY, but we should all consider what generic GLP1’s hitting the market at the same time as orals next year will do. These two coinciding events could rapidly diminish the spooky novelty and price of these drugs, driving demand and adoption throughout the world. Next year will be pivotal, but this also raises the question, which companies are making the first truly affordable versions of these drugs? First, this won’t be a market for just any generics maker, only those experienced in manufacturing biosimilar peptides and injectables will have a chance here, so it's not as zero-sum as some simple pressed pill generics market. The first mover will be the Swiss generics maker Sandoz (SDZNY) which plans to have generics on shelves in Canada by January at around $75 dollars a month (\~70% discount to current prices). That is the price of a nice gym membership. The other confirmed entrants in Canada will be Apotex (private), BIOCON.NS, and Dr. Reddy’s (RDY). Expect TEVA pharma and Viatris (VTRS) to enter later. I like SDZ quite a bit, price-to-sales of 2.4, forward P/E of 25. It’s up 45% this year but that's not ridiculous in this market. Here is some quick back of the napkin math: Current estimate is 2026 total revenue grows from 11B to 11.875B, 3%(300M) increase y/y from 2025 growth. Currently 1M Canadian GLP1 users, 4M total type 2 diabetics. Let’s say SDZ gets 500k of sales at $75 for 10 months of 2026, that is 375M of new revenue from just Canada GLP1’s next year. This is an extremely rough estimate, but I buy the general case of SDZ’s revenue from just GLP1’s next year being underestimated. RDY like SDZ is an experienced biosimilars manufacturer and has plans to aggressively enter all markets open to generics, especially its home market India. With a p/e of 18, p/s of 3, basically no debt and \~800M in cash RDY looks like a value play in an expensive market. If these drugs take off in these foreign markets this could be criminally undervalued. Now a bit more on these markets specifically: Brazil is an underrated market, there are \~70-80M Brazilians who have private health insurance and make up a wealthier cohort who live very much like the average American. A study found this cohort’s life expectancy (83yrs) is actually higher. Of this privately insured cohort, \~14M are obese, and \~6M have type 2 diabetes. This is much larger than the Canadian market, and should be made up of fairly analogous market participants. There are, of course, the other 150M Brazilians as well. Consider [HYPE3.SA](http://HYPE3.SA) as a pure Brazil play, but SDZ, RDY, BIOCON, and TEVA will all be here as well. Expect BIOCON, RDY, and SUN Pharmaceuticals to dominate an Indian market that while very large (70M-85M type 2 diabetics), will be extremely crowded, and frankly hard to gauge in terms of adoption. I want to buy BIOCON as they are an experienced exporter with a large Canadian presence, but I’ve had no luck doing so because there are no ADRs. A final note on generics, TEVA may win in the end at least revenue-wise. They are the generics giant, have the most know-how, and have quietly already got their foot in the door. Just a couple months ago they started making generic liraglutide in the US, an early GLP1 (not very good, so not a huge deal). This won’t impact their bottom line but it builds their GLP1 production capability for free, expect them to enter these markets aggressively, if you like the value here like I do, make it your top generics play. Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is a speculative play that I’m sure many of you have probably heard of. They make an oral that just completed phase 2 trials successfully, but the market hated the results due to high expectations. Personally, having read the study, I think it was blown out of proportion and it's valued nicely as a speculative play. I certainly like their drug better than Amgen’s or Metsera/Pfizer’s because it is an oral with genuinely good weight loss results already in phase 3 trials. Telemedicine is the last obvious place to look here, the pick is LifeMD (LFMD). NVO and LLY are never going to do business with HIMS again after the compounding issue, and HIMS cannot directly sell semaglutide or tirzepitide at all. LFMD has direct partnerships with both LLY and NVO and directly sells on their platform. Buy this as a fairly pure GLP1 play in telemedicine, and don’t worry too much about them getting sued, that's just a right of passage for telemedicine companies (seriously though). The valuation here is also just flat out good, 1.3 p/s (compared to HIMS’ 6.5) and analysts are rating it with serious upside right now. I may have buried the lede here as LFMD is arguably the purest GLP1 bull case play other than NVO and LLY and it is nice and beaten down, the red flags are the lawsuits and potential regulatory issues with telemedicine. A final note: NVO’s EVOKE Phase 3 Alzheimer’s/Dementia study will report results by the end of 2025, maybe any day now. Results will likely be middle of the road, if they are bad, well, we’ll take a hit with losing potential dementia treatment upside. But if results are good the sky might be the limit here, if GLP1’s can significantly treat obesity and Alzheimer’s with an oral pill… well you do the math. Get in or get out before these results drop. My GLP1 portfolio is about 35% LLY, 20% NVO, 15% LFMD, 10% TEVA, 10% SDZ, 5% RDY, and 5% VKTX.

T,1nsvn9z,ValueInvesting,OXY in Talks to Sell OXYCHEM for $10bn,"A few hours ago a FT article dropped which said OXY is in talks to sell its chemical unit for $10bn. According to Vicki Hollub (CEO) Oxy will start buying back shares and increasing its dividend once its debt load is below $15bn. Now its debt is around $24bn, so if they sell for $10bn and use all of it to pay down debt, I think shareholder return are going to increase substantially even at current oil prices. As a shareholder of OXY I would like to see the sale coming through, especially at $10bn. The only thing I don’t quite understand is that Vicki Hollub repeatedly said that its CCS/U project uses large amounts of Chemicals (mainly KOH) for which oxychem is the largest or second largest producer in the US and this way they have many synergies. I bought oxy for their reserves and their relatively low break even in the Permian and I don’t really think that their carbon capture business will take off, but I don’t like that the CEO is inconsistent there.

T,1odpaqs,ValueInvesting,Netflix ($NFLX) Crashes 10% After Earnings Miss. Time to Buy the Dip?,"Netflix ($NFLX) shares plunged more than 10% today, marking the company’s worst session since April 2022. The sell-off followed a Q3 earnings miss, weaker-than-expected guidance, and renewed concerns over global trade tensions. Yet while traders fled, several analysts and institutional investors expressing a possible entry point in one of the market’s most resilient companies. **Timeline of Today’s Events:** * **10:31 AM** – Investingcom reports Wall Street opens lower as investors digest mixed earnings; Netflix leads declines after missing expectations. * **10:35 AM** – Reuters notes the S&P 500 ticks lower as Netflix drops sharply, dragging the tech sector. * **10:40 AM** – Barron’s lists Netflix among the top market movers alongside Tesla and Texas Instruments, following its earnings disappointment. * **10:45 AM** – Marketbeat confirms Netflix shares gap down after Q3 EPS of **$5.87 vs. $6.96 expected**, citing a Brazil tax dispute that hit margins. * **10:47 AM** – CNBC reports Netflix won’t pursue a Warner Bros.

Netflix remains a free cash flow machine, generating over $6 billion annually with expanding advertising revenue and steady global subscriber growth near 290 million. Even after the correction, Netflix commands strong pricing power, an unmatched content library, and a growing AI-enabled production edge that could drive margin expansion. Trading near 27× forward earnings, the valuation now looks reasonable for a company with this scale, moat, and cash profile.

T,1o2pvyd,ValueInvesting,"Cellebrite ($CLBT): Deep Moat, Durable Compounder, Discounted Multiple","I think Cellebrite (NASDAQ: CLBT) is an interesting opportunity Key Stats * 4.6B Market Cap * 52W High: $26.3, 52W Low: $13.10 * 20%+ YoY Revenue Growth * 7.9x EV/Revenue, 37x P/E * \~0% Debt **Elevator Pitch** This is a high quality, mission-critical software company with an impenetrable public-sector moat and dominant share in digital investigations. Rising case backlogs are forcing agencies to expand their use of its tools, and no credible alternative exists, leaving Cellebrite poised to win. With short-term fears driving a temporary discount and imminent near-term catalysts, there’s clear asymmetric upside. **Business & Industry Overview** Known for its phone-hacking tools, Cellebrite first gained attention after the 2016 San Bernardino case, when its tech helped the FBI bypass iPhone encryption. When Trump was nearly assassinated in July 2024, Cellebrite’s software cracked the shooter’s phone within 40 minutes. They lead a duopoly in digital forensics with a first-mover advantage, high switching costs, latent pricing power, and strong cash generation. Shares are down \~30% (2–3x multiple compression) from 52-week highs amid temporary fears—federal budget noise, management changes, and exaggerated competition worries. These are transient, not structural. Cellebrite remains the backbone of global digital investigations—nobody ever got fired for buying Cellebrite. Cellebrite provides mission-critical digital forensics software to law enforcement, evolving from device extraction to a full-stack forensics workflow—unlocking, extracting, analyzing, and sharing device data as court-admissible evidence. Top-Line Breakdown 1. Digital Forensics Suite (80%) – Legacy UFED + Physical Analyzer bundle for extraction and analysis. Cellebrite is now upgrading users to Inseyets, a premium cloud-based suite integrating UFED/PA with features like Automation, Triage, and Quick View. 2. New Products (10%) – Guardian (cloud evidence management) and Pathfinder (multi-device analytics), both nearly doubling YoY. 3. Professional Services (10%) – Training and integration support. Cellebrite serves 7K+ customers—90% public sector—across local, state, federal, and international agencies. The U.S. drives 52% of revenue; Europe/APAC make up the rest. Financially elite: 20–25% ARR growth, 85% gross margins, 26% FCF margins, 20+ quarters of 120%+ NRR, $500M cash, and no debt—making it a “Rule of 45” software company. Digital forensics is a $15B market growing 15% CAGR. Roughly 90% of cases involve digital evidence, and rising case complexity and backlogs are structurally increasing demand for Cellebrite’s software. **Thesis #1 — Growth Algorithm** *TL;DR*: Bears argue Cellebrite’s growth is capped due to full penetration; bulls see a large untapped opportunity to expand usage within existing agencies that urgently need more tools. \-- The central question is whether Cellebrite’s growth can persist. Bears note near-full logo penetration—50/50 U.S. states, 20/20 top police departments, 27/27 EU members, and 9/10 top tech firms—arguing growth from upselling existing clients will fade as ARR growth normalizes below 20%. 2025 headwinds reinforced that narrative: DOGE budget confusion caused contract delays and soft guidance, the founder/CEO exited after 20 years, and churn temporarily rose to \~9% (mostly from terminating misuse-prone customers). Many mistook these transitory issues for structural decline. Bulls counter that while Cellebrite has reached peak breadth, it remains far from peak depth. Penetration within agencies is only 5–8%. Nearly every case involves digital evidence, yet only a small fraction of agents have access to Cellebrite tools—creating significant latent demand. In my conversations with customers, I found that agents routinely **shared devices**, sometimes driving hours between departments and delaying investigations from one month to a year. This backlog highlights a major supply-demand imbalance. The company is actively expanding by doing two things. First, they are selling *more licenses* to Digital Forensics Units (DFU) and upgrading customers to increase their allotted consumption of Cellebrite cloud products. Second, they are expanding to Investigative Units (IU). In law enforcement, the DFUs specialize in digital forensics analysis and investigation. Now, IUs work on prosecution and investigative cases writ large: they do the heavy work for the rest of the case-building and analysis. But, when a component of the investigation requires a digital analysis, they ship it off to the DFU. Now, each DFU serves \~13 independent IU’s: the agents at normal branches will ship off whatever DFU serves their branch. This dynamic is now changing: Cellebrite is now directly selling technology to IUs so they can triage devices and help speed up the process, eliminating the need to wait on DFUs to get back to them on current cases. This way, IUs can quickly assess the surface level of a digital case, and if need be, they can send it to the digital DFU lab for further investigation—Cellebrite sells more devices, backlogs will go down, and agencies can process more cases faster. It’s a win-win for everyone involved, and it’s only a matter of time before those sales are made. The thesis here is simple: backlogs are exploding, agencies are stretched, and Cellebrite is the only trusted vendor. The technology is mission-critical, and expanding licenses is inevitable. Even small increases in adoption per agency materially compound ARR. Growth can triple within a few years as agencies expand usage to meet investigative demand. **Thesis #2 — FedRAMP** TL;DR: The market is missing the forest for the trees on imminent FedRAMP authorization. It will expand Cellebrite’s ability to sell cloud products across the public sector. While consensus focuses on federal upside (\~20% of revenue), the larger opportunity lies in downstream state and local adoption (\~80%). \-- Cellebrite is expanding beyond phone unlocking into full-chain forensics—helping law enforcement access, analyze, and store data securely. Its Inseyets, Guardian, and Pathfinder products are cloud-based and command premium pricing with strong ROI by automating manual and paper-heavy workflows. Today, most digital investigations remain off-cloud due to strict Chain of Custody requirements. Agencies still rely on USBs and physical files, unable to migrate workflows due to regulatory barriers. Cellebrite’s local tools (UFED/PA) have long satisfied these rules but lack cloud efficiency. FedRAMP approval changes this. FedRAMP—the federal government’s cloud security certification—allows vendors to sell cloud software to agencies with stringent clearance needs. Federal customers (\~20% of Cellebrite’s base) await authorization, which began in March 2024 and is expected within two quarters. The direct federal revenue uplift could be $50–150M, with sell-side estimates ranging $20–80M. But the larger opportunity is sub-federal diffusion. Historically, once the federal government certifies a technology, state and local agencies follow rapidly. “If it’s safe for the feds, it’s safe for us.” After Zoom’s 2019 FedRAMP approval, for instance, adoption surged across local agencies, who can fast-track funding for federally cleared tools. **This is much larger opportunity for seat expansion** because of how much wider the customer base is. State and local agencies—80% of Cellebrite’s base—face tight budgets but stand to benefit most from cloud migration. FedRAMP removes the security barrier, and growing digital backlogs ensure eventual adoption. Timing is uncertain, but directionally inevitable. I estimate +$110M in ARR from sub-federal cloud adoption alone, excluding federal uplift. **Potential PE Sale** While speculative, Cellebrite is a prime private equity acquisition candidate given its sticky recurring revenue, high margins, and cash generation. With peers increasingly privatized, Cellebrite could be next. SunCorp owns 50% of the company, and potential buyers include Axon, Motorola, and Vista. Axon already holds a 5% stake, and its ecosystem synergies with Cellebrite are strong despite non-overlapping offerings. The SPAC sponsor True Wind holds 20% of SunCorp and has an earnout at $30/share expiring August 2026, implying a target acquisition benchmark. The newly appointed CFO has a history of preparing companies for sale—further aligning incentives toward a transaction. There has been increasing activist pressure within SunCorp to sell the business **Risks & Mitigants** 1. iOS Vulnerability Concerns – A 2024 leak claimed Cellebrite couldn’t access iOS 17, raising fears of share loss to Magnet. I got on the phone with a security research expert, and found that these fears were misplaced. Even if the company fails to crack the software, vulnerabilities still exist at the hardware and firmware level. Enforcement agencies can still bypass those levels depending on the OS—for example, baseband exploits, boot ROM exploits, chip-off attacks, firmware downgrades and emulation, or JTAG. Of course, these methods are slow, expensive, and require physical possession of the phone, but they do serve as a viable back-up while the software is yet to be cracked. Also, the consequence is negligible. Magnet and Cellebrite remain the two required industry standards, and even if Magnet cracks iOS first, Cellebrite remains essential. They also provide value beyond cracking the phones in evidence management and triage, ensuring that agencies still fundamentally need the products at the end of the day. Lastly, the firm’s superior R&D spend, privileged law enforcement relationships, and elite ex-Apple/Android talent pipeline ensure ongoing technical leadership. 2. Management Turnover – The founder/CEO left after 20 years, initially spooking investors. The new CEO, a Cellebrite veteran and longtime board member, has stabilized operations and proven execution under DOGE uncertainty through successful upsell initiatives. His enterprise software experience supports continuity. **Valuation** Under conservative assumptions—3% price increases (vs. 5% historical), 40% Guardian penetration (vs. 50% target), \~2.5 average seat growth per customer from FedRAMP expansion, minimal near-term federal uplift, steady margins, and an 8.5x exit multiple—the model implies \~98% upside over 3 years. **Catalysts** * World Cup 2026: $1B+ in public safety funding and heightened demand for digital law enforcement tools. * Q3 2025 FedRAMP authorization: triggers cloud sales ramp in FY26. * Long-term: Guardian and Pathfinder penetration targets (50%+) achieved by FY28.",8,2,2025-10-10 03:09:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2pvyd/cellebrite_clbt_deep_moat_durable_compounder/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.057688,0.5,$T,0.6,['CLBT'],"['bull', 'bear', 'rally', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'loss', 'acquisition']",0.7457142857142857

T,1nznwl1,wallstreetbets,Why $GRAB is the Undeniable Play for the end of 2025:,"If you’re not stacking $GRAB right now, you’re basically leaving free money on the table. Grab Holdings isn’t just another ride-hailing play – it’s the everything-app dominating Southeast Asia with deliveries, fintech, and payments. Think Uber + DoorDash + Venmo, but in a region with 700M+ people and exploding digital adoption You just gotta love it…. Q3 2025 earnings are due November 18, 2025 • Earnings Beat & Institutional Love: Just crushed consensus estimates, closing at $6.16 with a $24.81B market cap. Big players like J. Safra Sarasin are piling in, growing their stakes – when whales swim, you follow. 2025 Outlook is Chef’s Kiss: Revenue pegged at $3.41B with EPS at $0.05 – that’s profitability knocking, folks. And it’s ranked in “Top Stocks to Buy Now” lists for October. If that’s not a green light, what is? Analysts project revenue acceleration from financial services (e.g., payments and lending) and on-demand GMV, which grew 20% YoY in Q4 2024. Southeast Asia’s GDP growth (~5% annually) and Grab’s 70%+ market share in key markets like Indonesia underpin this. However, risks include competition from GoTo and economic volatility. • Profitability Trajectory: Grab achieved its first profitable quarter in Q4 2024 ($11M net income) and full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of ~$200M+. For 2026, forecasts imply sustained positive free cash flow (~$300M+), building on 2025’s expected breakeven. • Valuation Implications: At a forward P/E of ~50x on 2026 EPS, the stock (trading ~$6) trades at a premium to peers like Uber (30x), but analysts justify it via 40%+ earnings growth. Consensus price target: $6.03 (Hold rating overall, with 23 Buys). TL;DR: $GRAB’s got the news tailwinds, rock-solid TA, and a market that’s begging for disruption. At this valuation (forward P/E ~50x on growth trajectory), it’s undervalued vs. peers like Uber. I’m loading up for the ride to $8+ by EOY.

T,1o1rdha,stocks,$ARCHR…Let’s do a deeper dive into the financials…feedback wanted.,"When will the world see the $ACHR Midnight actually take off vertically, transition to horizontal flight and back to a vertical landing with four human passengers and one pilot? Next…Archer must get all FAA certifications completed…so when does this happen? Next $ACHR burned through $198 Million in the last quarter. For all of 2025 it will be approximately $688.6 - $700 million. $ACHR must produce and sell over 1,100 aircraft per year to make a 10% net income margin currently. Their stated target for only 650 aircraft annually by 2030 is hugely problematic for they must produce and sell almost twice that to have a 10% net profit margin. Their stated target the company officially has made will not see this company turning anywhere close to a net profit even by 2030. So I must ask this question…..how in the hell is $ACHR worth even $10 per share currently. To substantiate a $10 per share price $ACHR must build and sell at least 370 Midnight aircraft per year and would be substantially under the 1,100 units that substantiate a 10% net profit. At only 370 units per year $ACHR would be losing around $130 Million a year or more. On top of this…how do the people buying these units at $5 Million per unit turn a profit? With the life expectancy at 10,000 flights at 20 minutes per flight and maximum passenger capacity at 4 each seat must cost at least $500 or $2,000 for four people to fly for 20 minutes at a 10,000 flight expected life span. This cost of a $500 ticket per person would cover the $5 Million cost of the unit, an ongoing maintenance contract, the eventual complete replacement cost of the $5 million unit plus inflation, pilot expenses, taxes on ticket sells, and all other associated administrative overhead, marketing etc not to mention the cost of electrical utility charges, heliport charges, etc…and how much profit left over maybe 10-20% net profit in the end…..all of this after charging $500 per seat per each 20 minute flight. Now if you have a better formula for profits after all associated costs concerning these eVTOLs I am all ears. Don’t give me the fluff bullshit studies made to attract investors and buyer operators….I am looking at these eVTOLs at a real world cost basis and what actual profits or ROI both the Archer Aviation Company is going to make as well as the buyer operator end users are going to make….and what the actual real world cost is per seat per customer per the average 20 minute flight. At maximum usage of 2,920 hours per year each $5 Million unit will only last 3.42 years. Thats at a 40 minute duty cycle 20 minute flight+10 minute turn around+10 minute charging top-up and a 16 hour operational day. If the true lifespan of these units is only 10,000 operating flight hours as discussed in the eVTOL industry in general even if you double that number an operator will need to buy another replacement unit at about 6-7 years tops…but most likely between 3.42-7 years…on average. Will the masses really pay for the cost that will need to be charged for both the manufacturer and operator to remain profitable or….will all involved including the institutional investors as well as the private investors see a huge fomo MOMO overpriced valuation that will eventually see reality hit in massive losses as consumers are turned off by the high cost of 20 minute eVTOL taxi service? Battery power range will need to double. The cost per unit will need to be half. And the lifespan of each unit must be 10 years for the consumers to get cheaper per trip costs, and the operators themselves to stay profitable. I don’t see the initial financial model of the eVTOL industry working as a profitable enterprise with all the current data. What I do see is plenty of professional institutional investors as well as gullible private investors who are throwing money at the eVTOL industries birth because of the excitement and MOMO FOMO surrounding it all without dissecting the details.",5,48,2025-10-08 23:59:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1rdha/archrlets_do_a_deeper_dive_into_the/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.894065,0.5,$T,0.9,"['ACHR', 'ARCHR']","['bull', 'profit', 'loss', 'ipo']",0.7228571428571429

Its strategic alignment with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, tech-driven transformation, and unmatched global footprint position it for long-term dominance. What are your thoughts? COSCO Shipping: The Geopolitical Compounder Hiding in Plain Sight ⚠️ Disclaimer This content is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Always conduct your own research or consult a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions. COSCO Shipping isn’t just another logistics company — it’s a strategic behemoth at the heart of China’s global ambitions. Yet today, it trades at fire-sale valuations, with its Hong Kong-listed shares priced at a fraction of their intrinsic value — and a full 26% discount compared to its mainland A-shares. Investors are overlooking a titan that’s not only profitable and dividend-paying, but also poised to dominate the next era of global trade. From automated smart ports to the Arctic shipping corridor that could reshape Eurasian logistics, COSCO is underpinned by deep strategic investments in infrastructure as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Its unmatched efficiency and scale could drive explosive growth in demand, not just market share — making COSCO a rare blend of income, innovation, and geopolitical leverage in a mispriced industry. 📦 Why Shipping Is the Smart Money’s Play — and Retail Is Missing Out The backbone of global trade is entering a tech-driven growth phase — and it’s still mispriced. 🛳️ Industry Primer: How Shipping Works Shipping is a B2B business at the core of global trade. Companies like COSCO move goods for manufacturers and retailers through: 📃 Long-term contracts for predictable cash flows ⚡ Spot deals to capture high rates during demand spikes The core unit is the container, and carriers charge per container shipped. Vessels offer global flexibility — agile operators can redeploy ships anywhere to meet demand or respond to disruptions. 🌐 The Broader Supply Chain 🏗️ Shipbuilding: China now produces over 50% of global shipbuilding output (since 2023), reinforcing its dominance in maritime infrastructure. ⚓ Port Infrastructure: Smart ports and automated terminals reduce turnaround times and costs, becoming a competitive edge. 🚚 Intermodal Logistics: Containers move seamlessly from ships to trucks and rail, requiring integrated networks and alliances. 🔋 Fuel & Decarbonization: LNG and alternative fuels are reshaping cost structures and compliance with IMO regulations. Shipping is deeply capital- and labour-intensive, spanning shipbuilding, port logistics, heavy machinery operations, and ongoing vessel servicing. From constructing billion-dollar vessels to coordinating global container flows, the industry relies on vast infrastructure and skilled labour to keep trade moving. Beneath the surface, shipping is becoming a data-driven industry. AI is quietly transforming operations — from predictive maintenance and route optimization to automated port logistics and fuel efficiency modelling. As vessels, ports, and containers become smarter, the hidden AI play lies in orchestrating this complexity at scale, unlocking cost savings and agility across the supply chain. 📉 Shipping: Unloved and Unappreciated Over the past decade, investor capital has overwhelmingly rotated into high-growth sectors like technology, leaving traditional industries such as shipping in the shadows. The chart below — 10-Year Inflation-Adjusted Performance: DJGSH vs QQQ — illustrates this divergence vividly. While QQQ (tech-heavy Nasdaq) has surged over 300% in real terms, the Dow Jones Global Shipping Index (DJGSH) has barely moved, hovering near its starting point. This stark underperformance signals that shipping has been systematically ignored by growth-focused investors. [Source: Dow Jones, Invesco, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] 📌 Why This Matters Shipping is priced like a dying industry — but the fundamentals tell a different story. Here’s why investors should pay attention: ⚖️ 1. Structural Pessimism vs Reality The market treats shipping as if it’s in secular decline. In reality, the industry boasts: Strong balance sheets Persistent cash flows High return on capital employed (ROCE) High barriers to entry Rapid technological innovation 📈 2. Mean Reversion Potential Historically, extreme valuation compression in shipping has preceded sharp rebounds — especially when: Global trade normalizes Supply-demand dynamics tighten 💸 3. Income + Optionality Investors today can lock in double-digit yields while retaining upside from: Cyclical recovery Long-term structural shifts (e.g., Technological innovation, Belt and Road corridors, Arctic routes) Regardless of economic cycles, goods must move. Shipping companies generate consistent cash flows from essential trade routes — and supercharge earnings during market shocks. For contrarian investors, this disconnect between perception and reality creates a rare opportunity: buy a cash-rich, strategically vital industry at crisis-level valuations while the crowd chases momentum elsewhere. 📊 Cosco’s unique valuation: Industry Comparison COSCO trades at a P/E of just 3.4, far below its Western peers. Its 14.3% dividend yield is backed by strong cash flows and a disciplined payout policy, targeting 30–50% of net profits annually. Moreover, its Market Capitalisation is trading below Book Value, with an enormous $24bn in cash on the balance sheet. COSCO has delivered a 30% ROCE over the past five years — well above its 7% WACC, signalling robust value creation. The valuation gap reflects geopolitical bias and cyclical stigma, not fundamentals. 🧠 COSCO’s Strategic Positioning ⚙️ 1. Cost Structure 👷 Labor: Lower costs in China, amplified by automation and AI-driven smart ports, cut operational costs by up to 60% per container move using Level 4 autonomous trucks. [Source: Cosco Shipping] 💰 Capital: Preferential financing as a state-owned enterprise and favourable bond yields reduces borrowing costs. As stated in my previous sub-stack, the Chinese bond market yields favourable conditions for Chinese enterprise. 🏗️ Materials & Production: China’s shipbuilding dominance (>50% global output) and COSCO’s vertical integration in container manufacturing deliver lower vessel costs, shorter lead times, and superior unit economics. [Source: hkexnews] 🌍 2. Strategic Growth Levers Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) COSCO has invested RMB 79 billion (USD 11 billion) in BRI-related projects, including 21 overseas terminals (e.g., Piraeus, Abu Dhabi, Chancay). These assets secure control over critical trade nodes and enable COSCO to offer end-to-end logistics solutions across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. [Source: Seatrade Maritime News] Arctic Route (Polar Silk Road) Trials on the Northern Sea Route cut Asia-Europe transit times by up to 40% (~10 days), reducing fuel costs and emissions while bypassing congested and politically sensitive routes. COSCO is partnering with Russia to develop ice-class vessels for year-round Arctic operations. [Source: The Arctic Review] AI-Powered Smart Ports COSCO’s deployment of Level 4 autonomous trucks, IoT-enabled reefer containers, and blockchain-based green shipping certificates is transforming port efficiency and ESG credentials. [Sources: Cosco Shipping, Porttechnology.org] Why This Matters COSCO combines cost leadership with strategic optionality: When we look at the trend, we can see an exponential increase in Operating Cash Flow per share on the horizon, a key indicator of cash generation operating in a capital-intensive environment. [Source: COSCO Shipping Holdings] 🌐 Global Trade and Tariffs: The Risk the Market Overstates Much of COSCO’s undervaluation stems from Trump-era tariffs on Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships. For example: But trade wars are cyclical, not permanent. COSCO can mitigate tariff exposure by: Leveraging its 30% foreign built fleet Rerouting capacity toward ASEAN, EU, Africa, and Latin America, where demand is growing and tariffs are less punitive [Source: Seatrade Maritime] 🧠 Final Thoughts “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” — Warren Buffett COSCO isn’t just undervalued — it’s misunderstood. Its strategic alignment with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, tech-driven transformation, and unmatched global footprint position it for long-term dominance. The market is pricing it like a cyclical commodity stock, but beneath the surface, the fundamentals tell a different story: COSCO is a cornerstone of the next era of global trade and the technological revolution. Today, fear clouds perception — and therein lies the opportunity.",0,9,2025-10-22 19:01:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1odh8zu/cosco_shipping_the_geopolitical_compounder_hiding/,2025-10-23 09:08:11.981553,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'market cap', 'profit']",0.7228571428571429
T,1nzxqw6,ValueInvesting,AI Bubble + owner stakes,"A lot of great jokes on AI’s circular references. I was curious whether Intel-NVIDIA and AMD-OpenAI sort of deals happened during the dot com boom (and crash). Here are the scary results from ChatGPT: 🛒 1. AOL ↔ Amazon (1999) Structure: • AOL took a minority stake in Amazon worth ~$100 M. • In return, Amazon agreed to become AOL’s exclusive e-commerce books/music/video retailer for multiple years. • AOL also got warrants to buy additional Amazon stock at predetermined prices if certain referral traffic and revenue targets were met. Outcome: • Initially a market darling: Amazon stock soared from ~$6 to $80 (split-adjusted). AOL’s stake appreciated massively on paper. • After the 2000 crash, Amazon’s stock plunged 90%+, and the strategic exclusivity agreement was quietly unwound. • AOL never became a dominant e-commerce portal, and most of the warrant value fizzled. 👉 Key takeaway: In a boom, these deals looked brilliant; in the bust, the commercial synergies collapsed faster than the equity stakes could vest. ⸻ 📡 2. Yahoo! ↔ Google (2000) Structure: • Yahoo signed a deal to use Google’s search technology, and in 2000 bought a small equity stake in Google (exact % undisclosed but believed to be low single digits) as part of the licensing deal. • This was not a warrant deal, but a classic “strategic equity + commercial agreement” move. Outcome: • Ironically, Yahoo ended up helping Google become dominant. • Yahoo’s stake appreciated spectacularly after Google’s 2004 IPO — but Yahoo had sold most of it too early. • Commercially, Yahoo eventually replaced Google with its own search (powered by Inktomi), and the partnership ended. 👉 Key takeaway: Cross-stakes during boom times can create asymmetric power shifts. Yahoo gave Google crucial distribution, Google outgrew them, Yahoo missed the upside. ⸻ 💳 3. eBay ↔ Billpoint & Wells Fargo vs. PayPal (1999–2000) Structure: • eBay bought a 35% stake in Billpoint, a payments startup, jointly with Wells Fargo. • They structured additional performance-based equity awards if Billpoint hit user & transaction milestones. Outcome: • Billpoint lagged; PayPal exploded. eBay ended up buying PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 B. • The contingent stake never hit its targets, effectively becoming worthless. 👉 Key takeaway: Milestone-contingent stakes during hyper-growth can fail if the partner underperforms — exactly the risk OpenAI’s AMD warrants carry if deployment or price targets aren’t met. ⸻ 🧭 4. Cisco’s “Internet ecosystem” spree (1998–2000) Structure: • Cisco took minority stakes (1–10%) in hundreds of startups, often with warrants or options tied to OEM/supply relationships. • They’d invest, agree to distribute or bundle the startup’s tech, and sometimes have call options to acquire later at fixed prices. Outcome: • Many of these looked brilliant on paper in 1999 — Cisco’s balance sheet ballooned with unrealized gains. • Post-crash, the majority of these startups collapsed, the stakes were written off, and Cisco was left with a graveyard of non-vested or worthless warrants. 👉 Key takeaway: Warrants tied to market exuberance often never vest if the market turns sharply. ⸻ ✈️ 5. Yahoo! ↔ Broadcast.com (1999) Structure: • Yahoo bought Broadcast.com for $5.7 B in stock (not a warrant deal, but a classic “booming stock for booming stock” acquisition). • Broadcast.com founders (including Mark Cuban) got Yahoo shares near the peak. Outcome: • Broadcast.com was essentially shuttered a few years later; Yahoo massively overpaid using its inflated stock. • Cuban famously hedged and diversified his Yahoo stake, becoming a billionaire; Yahoo shareholders took the hit in the crash. 👉 Key takeaway: Boom-era equity deals can transfer enormous paper value, but commercial reality often doesn’t justify the valuations.",5,13,2025-10-06 22:37:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nzxqw6/ai_bubble_owner_stakes/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.267394,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['revenue', 'acquisition', 'ipo', 'split']",0.7228571428571429

T,1odrhi8,ValueInvesting,Comcast (CMCSA) - overlooked and undervalued?,"At ~5× trailing earnings and a mid-teens FCF yield on equity (~15-17%), Comcast generates meaningful & durable recurring cash flows across several sectors: connectivity (cable/HFC + DOCSIS 4.0 upgrades), media/studios (NBCU, DreamWorks, Illumination via Universal Pictures), IP like Jurassic Park, Shrek, Fast & Furious, Minions, etc. and Theme Parks. Despite low growth and broadband competition, leverage is moderate and capital returns are meaningful. All of which allow it to sustain a healthy dividend & buybacks. A re-rating to even 7–8× earnings or an 8–9% FCF yield offers material upside on top of dividends/buybacks. - Market cap: $109B - Trailing P/E: ~4.9 - Cash: ~$9.7B - Total debt: ~$101.5B - Net leverage: ~2.3× - FCF Q2’25: $4.5B - TTM FCF: $16.6B - 2024 FCF: $12.5B - FCF yield: ~15–17% - 2024 net income: ~$16.2B (note: 2025 NI is inflated by a one-time Hulu gain) - Dividend: Annual $1.32/sh (≈4.4–4.5% yield); raised 6.5% YoY in 2025 - Growth/margins: +~2% YoY - Adjusted EBITDA (Q2): ~$10.3B - TTM net margin: ~18% There are multiple angles here: 1. Organic FCF compounding + balance-sheet actions: e.g., sell-off weaker divisions; refresh/re-structure the park pipeline, RE & IP, driving incremental EBITDA; securitize the fiber to monetize long-term fiber/enterprise contracts, accelerate cash realization; recycle proceeds from aforementioned to buybacks, de-leveraging, dividends or reinvestment into the business. Reinvestment to defend ARPU and churn in my mind would look something like refreshing IP, updating the network from HFC to hybrid fiber (DOCSIS 4.0 + targeted FTTH) + non-terrestrial networks/Low Earth Orbit satellite internet (partnership, or investment in “up-&-comer”?), R&D into Terahertz and Laser Links, or, even more outside the box (perhaps too far), expanding into sub-surface energy transmission since they have the expertise. Re-rating to even 7–8× earnings or 8–9% FCF yield implies material upside. I.e. Equity accretion through deleveraging + asset sales/monetization. 2. Downside protection via dividends and buybacks, which are sustainable (buybacks are sustainable at sub 6x earnings). 3. credible take-private/break-up scenarios. I value the company right around $111bn, w/ its current market cap hovering around $110bn. The mix of hard assets, predictable cash flows, & monetizable franchises makes Comcast a plausible target for scale PE (e.g., Blackstone, Apollo, Ellison, Berkshire Howard Hughes…). If taken private you sell off less desirable assets/divisions (like peacock); pivot to aggregation/licensing the IP; securitize the fiber network; sale-leaseback of marquee properties (which could include the parks) to an SPV, which becomes a separate vehicle entirely open to a distinct risk averse investor class (same with the fiber), & suddenly you’ve de-risked the deal and see a ROI within ~5 years. At ~4.9× earnings with a ~15-17% FCF yield, manageable debt, diversified cash flows and a substantial moat across several sectors, acquisition potential, there seems to be a mispricing between perceived secular decline and actual cash-flow durability. THE BAD: Broadband competition/overabundance and streaming drag could continue to mute growth and exert pricing pressure, cannibalizing margin and FCF. Studio economics are tough. Economic slowdown hits parks and fiber contracts hard — cyclical. IP theft and aging IP. Connectivity competition from companies like SpaceX. The obvious regulatory risk, especially with fiber. And, of course, execution risk - I’m not a huge fan of the current leadership. But even then, it’s still a bit of a cigar butt based on the balance sheet (i.e. cash, tangible/valuable real property, FCF yield) and moats (you can’t just go out and build an internet network, theme park or make the next DreamWorks) cushioning total returns via dividends and buybacks. But, this is less of a cigar and closer to a quality compounder temporarily priced like a no-growth utility For those interested, this has me down the rabbit hole and I plan to look at GILT next.",3,0,2025-10-23 02:17:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1odrhi8/comcast_cmcsa_overlooked_and_undervalued/,2025-10-23 09:08:11.976438,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'market cap', 'acquisition']",0.6228571428571429
T,1occ01u,ValueInvesting,REIT in Strategic Alternatives with 38% to 100% Upside,"Franklin Street Properties ($FSP) is a small office REIT that has been slowly and unofficially liquidating for the past 5 years. Finally, in May of this year, they announced a review of strategic alternatives: “The review will include a range of potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company, a sale of assets, and a refinancing of existing indebtedness, among others.” I have been following FSP for over a year now, and the stock has traded below my estimate of NAV for the majority of this time. During the market decline in April, the stock dropped to $1.36, but I decided not to buy due to being uncertain of how long the gap between price and value would take to close. A month later, they announced the strategic review, and the stock shot up to almost $2 again; now the stock is back below $1.50 after stating clear intentions of selling out. Let’s see how the market is currently valuing FSP with the stock at $1.45. [https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties) At current prices, the market is valuing FSP at over a 12% cap rate and $79/sqft. At first glance, this seems a deeply conservative valuation for the whole portfolio. Recently, two office REITs got acquisition offers; one is Orion Properties ($ONL) for $2.75 per share for a total enterprise value of \~$650 million, at a 12.9% cap rate, $85/sqft, and an ABR multiple of 4.38x. City Office REIT will be acquired at an enterprise value of \~$1.05 billion, at a \~10% cap rate, \~$194/sqft, and an ABR multiple of \~6.2x. FSP has the lowest valuation per sqft and as an ABR multiple, but a slightly lower cap rate than ONL. Generally, FSP’s buildings are better than ONL and worse than CIO, but it's trading cheaper than both. FSP occupancy is around 67% compared to ONL's 77%. I think FSP's buildings could be leased up to the same occupancy as ONL if the required CapEx is spent; this represents upside for a prospective acquirer, more so considering that rent would go straight to the bottom line due to operating leverage in office buildings. **Sell-Out Scenarios:** This is my thought experiment about the possible scenarios for an acquiring firm. How good of a deal will they get? 1. $2.00/share: at this price, the acquirer would get a pretty attractive deal; they’d be buying decent office buildings at $90/sqft and over a 10% cap rate with the possibility of putting up capital to lease an extra 500k sqft and get to a reasonable 77-80% occupancy rate and maybe dispose of the obsolete buildings at $25-50 per sqft. 2. $2.20/share: I chose this price simply because it represents a 10% cap rate. It still gives the prospective buyer a reasonable upside if they can get occupancy close to 80%. Even if occupancy doesn’t realize, buying that group of buildings under $100/sqft is more than reasonable. 3. $3.00/share: This would be the best-case scenario, with limited upside to the acquiring firm. It is unlikely but not unreasonable. I reviewed the portfolio property by property about a year ago, and I got to a NAV of about $2.50. The properties that have sold since my first estimate have above my initial estimate, so my estimate might be on the conservative side. I believe that the company could get $2.50/share if they liquidated on an individual basis, and it could be realized in 2-3 years given that there are a total of only 14 separate properties. **How Long Will It Take to Sell Out?** While I don’t have an exact answer, I’ll evaluate it in 2 ways: 1. The property-by-property liquidation should take 2-3 years. Net Leased Office Properties ($NLOP) has sold 20 office properties in the last 2 years. A 2-3 year time frame for 14 properties seems more than reasonable. 2. If they are reaching out to prospective buyers, they should receive an offer sooner than the estimated time of liquidating individually. I want to address FSP’s debt quickly. All of their maturities are due April 1st of 2026. I believe the creditors will collaborate and extend the maturities because: 1. NOI covers the interest expense by 2x. NOI being $45 million and interest expense $22.5 million, while having $30 million in cash. 2. If equity is wiped out, the creditors will own the office space at $51/sqft.

There is >6x return potential if management is able to refinance expensive preferred equity (i.e., they acquired assets worth $600mm, and had mkt cap of $200mm before the acquisition) but still trade at $100mm markt cap Prairie Operating Co is a newly formed, founder-led small-cap oil roll-up in the DJ Basin. In March, the company issued $150 million of high-cost preferreds to fund a $600 million transformative acquisition (a bold move given its pre-deal market cap of just ~$200 million). The deal takes Prairie from effectively zero production to an expected run-rate EBITDA of roughly $360(!) million by the end of 2025. The preferreds carry a 12% coupon and can be converted to equity if not repaid by March 2026; the market is pricing in dilution today and valuing the business effectively at <2x EBITDA FY25 EBITDA. There is no downside at today’s valuation if the prefs to convert to equity and >6x upside if the company is able to refinance the prefs. Since, May company insiders have bought ~$2mm of stock (on what is ~$100mm market cap); most recent insider purchase was early in September when insider purchased ~$180k of stock; the weighted average purchase price of the stock is ~$3 (stock trades today at ~$2). Management has made clear their top priority is taking out the prefs before year-end, likely through an expanded reserve-based lending facility or a new high-yield financing. Massive amounts of insider buying ensures alignment and instances where there is asymmetric information flow actioned into insider purchases for small cap companies is rarely ever a bad thing. If they pull it off, the equity could be six times where it trades today. If they don’t, downside appears limited on fundamentals, given how compressed the multiple already is. Recent production misses were tied to short-term delays rather than structural issues, and guidance still points to a >$360 million EBITDA exit run-rate.

T,1ns5fjr,ValueInvesting,Overpriced Equity Market Bonds & Other Safe Assets,"One thing I learned quite hard way is not try to predict the market. However, the current equity market is at all time highs and prices look quite expensive except few stocks which got hammered down. From this perspective, I am thinking whether it makes sense to start moving money to bonds. I had been doing small investments in bond market from last year however it is becoming increasingly hard to beat inflation after the returns. 2024 Bond market really came down and I am thinking with an equity crash whether we will see lower interest rate again. However, I can see what could happen with government debt being so high and they could repeat what they did in 1945. ""1945 financial repression"" refers to the period following World War II when many governments, including the United States, implemented financial repression policies to manage their high debt loads. These policies included artificially keeping interest rates low and controlling financial institutions to reduce the real value of their accumulated government debt and lower debt-to-GDP ratios. **Key characteristics of financial repression after 1945:** * **Low Interest Rates:** Governments set interest rates at artificially low levels, often below the rate of inflation, to make their debt cheaper to service. * **Government Control:** Authorities often controlled the financial sector, directing capital and limiting financial choices to ensure government debt was held and that funds were available for public investment. * **Debt Management:** The primary goal was to reduce the burden of war-related debt, which was as high as 100% of GDP for some nations in 1945. * [**Liquidation**](https://www.google.com/search?cs=0&sca_esv=fe0550819d8f48a0&sxsrf=AE3TifObF5u0NPdhgBJxFHFY-DAM6Kj92g%3A1759004713747&q=Liquidation&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjksOGY4_mPAxW9T6QEHfIxAR4QxccNegQIDhAB&mstk=AUtExfCKxmEa5io003LXQvDvn6s5Ds91RdDLKbDc81Ze5vtNs2hVxSCN3UGoiv4XBBBSwYxre-TFvMh5lEWFyL76MmTOItadNveCyw1wNwSLXmFgwftSDAUgWDI94PGrnAgd2LXuiUotq9vOOTuLHHz9HXJGAvJElEX49LPf33941jXVtac&csui=3) **of Debt:** By keeping real interest rates negative, governments effectively ""liquidated"" their debt, meaning the real value of the money owed to bondholders decreased over time It looks a bit more scarier than a 2008 because both equity and bond markets look riskier. Gold would have been an option but you cannot be 100% gold in a portfolio and Gold is at all time high. Would like everyone's views or hypothesis and may be a good strategy can be carved. Update Here is what Claude AI said on this. Worth reading. ""Based on current evidence, here are the key indicators that suggest the US government may be preparing for or moving toward financial repression policies: # Direct Policy Indicators # 1. Debt Management Crisis The debt limit was reinstated at $36.1 trillion on January 2, 2025, representing the total amount of outstanding debt. The Treasury is already using extraordinary measures, including tapping civil service and postal retirement funds to meet federal obligations. This shows the government is under significant debt pressure. # 2. Interest Rate Suppression Mechanisms Markets are pricing in continued Fed rate cuts, with 89% probability of another 0.25% cut at the October 2025 meeting and high odds of additional December cuts. This suggests policy makers are committed to keeping rates low despite potential inflationary pressures. # 3. Yield Curve Control Discussion Under yield curve control (YCC), the Fed would target longer-term rates and pledge to buy enough long-term bonds to keep rates from rising above target. While not yet implemented, countries are actively using YCC policies in real time, suggesting this tool is being seriously considered. # Structural Economic Indicators # 4. Debt Servicing Pressure The rise of net debt cost-to-government-revenues ratio is expected to slow in 2025, partly because short-term yields have declined, somewhat narrowing the yield gap between maturing and new bonds. This shows the government is acutely aware of debt servicing costs and benefits from suppressed rates. # 5. Institutional Framework Changes In December 2024, GAO recommended that Congress consider immediately replacing the debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions. This could remove debt ceiling constraints that currently limit the government's ability to implement financial repression. # Historical Context Financial repression policies involve measures that enable governments to place debt with financial institutions at ""artificially low interest rates,"" and it wasn't just the US that used this method historically. Financial repression is intended to help governments deleverage over time by artificially lowering yields on government bonds. # Key Warning Signs to Monitor: **Immediate Indicators:** * Implementation of yield curve control by the Federal Reserve * Regulatory pressure on banks to hold more government bonds * Capital controls or restrictions on international investments * Negative real interest rates becoming persistent policy **Policy Rhetoric:** * Emphasis on ""financial stability"" over market-determined rates * Discussion of making the financial system serve ""national priorities"" * Increased regulation of pension funds and insurance companies **Market Behavior:** * Unusual Treasury auction dynamics or direct Fed intervention * Persistent yield curve suppression despite inflation * Regulatory changes that effectively force institutions to hold government debt The current situation shows many preconditions for financial repression are present: high debt levels, political pressure to keep borrowing costs low, and central bank tools that can suppress longer-term rates. While not yet fully implemented, the infrastructure and justifications for such policies are being established.""",0,1,2025-09-27 20:27:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ns5fjr/overpriced_equity_market_bonds_other_safe_assets/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.293199,0.5,$T,0.6,[],['revenue'],0.6057142857142856

T,1o5hdxa,wallstreetbets,$UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD),"Okay I know what you're all thinking. >iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡 Normally that’s the right call. Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port. But if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it. Here's why: # Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now: 1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**. 2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts. 3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight. 4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale. 5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues and no need to scramble for cash. # So what are the risks? 1. China and the U.S. suddenly make a deal and China floods the market with cheap rare earths. Could it happen? Maybe. Will it? No. The U.S. isn’t going to keep letting China hold this over their head. It’s literally a national security issue, and the Section 232 investigation report that is supposed to come out later this month will support that. The government *HAS* to build domestic supply. 2. Short term profit taking: The stock has gone straight vertical so I definitely admit that people will look to lock in gains here and there. However, I don’t see anyone dumping heavy until major catalysts play out (like the DOE meeting, potential government deals, Section 232 investigation, etc.). **Sources / Recent News:** * [China tightens rare earth export controls, escalating trade tensions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Beijing defends rare earth curbs, blames U.S. for rising tensions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-its-rare-earth-export-controls-are-legitimate-2025-10-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Trump says he’s weighing a massive increase in tariffs on Chinese imports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-weighing-massive-increase-tariffs-chinese-imports-no-reason-meet-with-2025-10-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Pentagon launching $1B critical minerals stockpiling program](https://www.kmjnow.com/2025/10/12/pentagon-plans-1b-critical-minerals-buying-spree/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Energy Fuels produces first heavy rare earth oxides at White Mesa Mill](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Energy Fuels says it can produce six rare earths now subject to China’s export bans](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-says-it-can-produce-six-rare-earths-subject-chinese-export-controls/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [U.S. offers to buy stakes in Australian critical minerals companies](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-offers-buy-stakes-australian-critical-minerals-companies-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) **TLDR:** $UUUU is the only U.S. company producing both uranium and heavy rare earths right as the government is scrambling to cut off dependence on China, launching a $1B stockpile, holding a DOE meeting on nuclear energy Tuesday, and wrapping up the Section 232 national security report - all catalysts that can drive the price higher. **Positions: 1,505 $24 calls exp 10/31 @ $1.95** because the biggest catalysts haven’t even dropped yet.

I'm back with an update on $POET, because the market is overlooking the most bullish news release this company has ever put out. [From two weeks ago:](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-to-present-at-ecoc-2025) >""*Initial purchase order for production volumes of optical engines placed by a key customer* >... Separately, POET announced that it has **received an initial production order from one of its lead customers**, valued in excess of US$500,000, for optical engines based on the POET Optical Interposer™ platform technology. >The optical engines that have been ordered are scheduled to ship in early 2026 and **production is expected to grow to high volumes as the year progresses**. The Company also stated that during the past few months **it has fulfilled multiple orders from other customers** for the purpose of high-speed transceiver module development."" For whatever reason, these paragraphs were a footnote to the titular aspect of the news release, which was announcing an intention to present at some optics conference in Europe (who cares). What's crucial is that they officially confirmed purchase orders (POs) for their products and added the crucial line, ""PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO HIGH VOLUMES AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES"". They are outright telling anyone who cares to listen that they have a huge production ramp (and thus revenue growth) coming in the near future. The key thing to remember is that **this is the FIRST OF MANY POs** that POET will receive. Don't believe me? POET has two manufacturing facilities--one up and running, one that will start production this quarter. Their first facility produces 1M optical engines a year. If you estimate the price of a single optical engine at $500 ([this is conservative](https://www.fs.com/c/ethernet-networking-3859)), you get **$500M in revenue a year from that facility alone.** Thus, their first PO could be accounting for just 1/1000 of what they are slated to sell this coming year. If this is even REMOTELY close to being the case, POET is massively underpriced and should have a market cap well over $1B. As we progress through Q4, there will be an onslaught of PO announcements--in addition to other bullish news releases. Last week had TWO of the latter: >9/29: ""[POET today announced](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-sivers-semiconductors-collaborate-on-external-light-sources-for-co-packaged-optics-and-next-generation-ai-market) a strategic collaboration with Sivers Semiconductors AB (STO: SIVE), a global supplier of advanced optical semiconductors, to develop high-performance and cost-effective External Light Source (ELS) modules tailored for Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) and next-generation AI infrastructure."" >9/30: ""[POET today announced](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-semtech-launch-1-6t-optical-receivers-for-ai-networks) with Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC), a leading provider of high-performance semiconductor, Internet of Things (IoT) systems and cloud connectivity service solutions, the immediate availability for customer sampling of high-performance 1.6T Receiver Optical Engines for AI and cloud networks."" Again, such news releases would normally cause respectable pumps in the share price--but for some reason, this didn't happen. **THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND PRESENTS AN ASYMMETRICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SHORT-TERM UPSIDE.** This key point is a divergence from my previous post, where I did not think that there was a clear short-term play. I will again state that POET's announcement of a PO is the most bullish news release this company has ever put out. The fact that the share price did not even take out the local high of $7.60 is **RIDICULOUS**. I have bought 10/17 $7Cs, because I believe that the stock will revisit and take out the $7.60 double top in the coming weeks. [Cup and handle](https://preview.redd.it/azk5trit9ktf1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc27eed4b1d35967e6180312329c6ccfb4960c4) The chart is primed, and there's now a steady stream of bullish news. Oh, and we are currently in a euphoric AI bubble that shows no signs of popping soon. In a market where quantum (vaporware) stocks go parabolic when the CEO sneezes, a legitimate *and undervalued* AI play should wet your panties. As people begin to understand what POET actually does and where they are positioned within a lucrative market, the share price will soar. This will happen as more news and updates are provided by the company. **HOW TO PLAY THIS:** I feel that the recent POET news and broader market conditions (euphoria) are conducive to an explosive move higher. The safest way to play this is to buy 1/16/26 calls--there will be more than enough positive news over this period to push the stock much higher. **I am so confident in POET reaching $12 by EOY that I want the mods to permaban me if I'm wrong.** 1/16/26 calls would pay handsomely if I'm right. Gambling is fun, so I'm personally going with 10/17 calls. My hunch is that this at least re-tests the $7.60 top in the coming weeks. As you can see on the above chart, volume has been extremely high since the initial PO news came out. This continued today, which makes me think that recent price action is basing for an imminent move higher. https://preview.redd.it/pndtd3c6aktf1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=58cb6e65baf2c2648b1bcd13c8fd582fc58cf5c4 I will briefly include that due to the heavy call OI, any significant move higher (i.e. beyond $7.60) would likely be further compounded by institutional gamma hedging. **Risk Factors:** https://preview.redd.it/fv7zrf1x9ktf1.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddd19bdd69d34170715ab37ab43bbbbf2987ea8e **TL;DR:** POET is about to go up a lot because they announced they are going to start making shitloads of money. **Positions:** https://preview.redd.it/k7vsbx6z9ktf1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=571b23d46ca9dd4319393876a8a0f351af8963ca https://preview.redd.it/sk16du21aktf1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=03837fc8c5280ffb26d0b86de1ae70f2f84fb71a Not financial advice.",767,197,2025-10-06 23:25:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nzyv8l/poet_part_2_banbet_boogaloo/,2025-10-23 09:06:38.698596,0.45,$T,1.0,['POET'],"['bull', 'calls', 'volume', 'market cap', 'revenue']",1.0

On Tuesday, the stock suddenly dipped about a dollar, and from what it looked like, someone may have accidentally hit **sell instead of buy**.

T,1o35dfg,financialindependence,Year Update after $1M: Laid Off,"Hello! I wanted to give a year update since I’ve last posted my Reddit post about me hitting the [$1M Checkmark (a culmination of lessons from Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1g0t6e0/1m_checkmark_a_culmination_of_lessons_from_reddit/). For context, I’m 33M in VHCOL area. What’s happened since then? * I got laid off in February! I was on a snowboarding trip in Japan when I got the email, informing me of the layoff. I went to bed after the email, went snowboarding for a bit, and went to the onsen. I hated my tech job and while I was hoping to get laid off, it still hurt. The severance package was generous though: 8.5 months of pay, 8 months of health insurance, my vesting RSUs. * I got into a snowboarding accident. I went 50 miles per hour and tomahawked into the powder. I was rushed to the emergency room, got some fentanyl, and came out with a bruised rib. Luckily, it was a month after being laid off, so I had insurance which reduced the bill from $10k to $3k. * I panicked during the whole tariff thing and sold a lot of my portfolio.. Luckily, I went back in pretty early, but it also made me more motivated to go job hunting again. I’ve made a series of bad and good investing choices: lost $45k in OPEN (I bought at $3.7, sold at $2, my initial position was $100k). As of 10/9, the price is $8, and I would be up an extra $116k. What did I learn? **Don’t panic..** * I decided to go back to my roots (before tech) and went back into private tutoring and SAT test preparation. It’s been quite satisfying for me and I get only about $330 a week in cash. It’s been a great mental shift as.. I use this cash as an excuse to eat healthier (I buy Sweetgreen salads for lunch every weekday..) * Job market is tough. I think if I was in a H1B situation or did not have my severance, I would’ve been more panicky and filled with more anxiety. I did get a job in August; it does not pay as much as it did when I was in tech (details below), but I’m actually quite happy with the work. I have a micro-manager, but financial independence has made me more confident and I feel empowered to say no to dumb requests. * I still go to therapy but I feel happier. I’ve told my therapist that I feel like I live life with more intention and am overall happier. It’s interesting because I am willing to spend money on Sweetgreen salads only because I do tutoring now for it, but I made more when I was in tech but never wanted to spend it. * I’ve been thinking a lot more about volunteering and where my money goes if I die since my snowboarding accident. I haven’t done any of the beneficiary stuff mainly because I don’t think I have anyone I would leave it to. But as I get older, I need to think about my will and whatnot. To do: Read Die with Zero. * Despite all of that (layoffs, bad financial mistakes, big life events), I am currently at $1.35M, which is 62% of my FI goal. I do need to recalculate my budget based off of my current spending habits. But I’ve already decided that my current situation is pretty much coastFIRE. Why? * My current work is quite interesting and I like the work and the stakeholders (for once, they also like me). * My company offers 1 month sabbaticals every 5 years, so it feels well balanced with PTO and workload. * I’ve decided to just work for as long as my dog is alive (she’s 5 right now, she’s expected to live until 18); my main reasoning is that she’s my only family and it’d be hard to just do my “live abroad for a few years” thing while she’s around. **Laid Off Specific Info** FAANG Salary TC: $287K ($209K Base) New Job TC: $158K (No RSU / Stock) **NW Breakdown (Last Year’s)** Brokerage: $469K ($340K) Roth IRA: $164K ($106K) FAANG 401k: $692K ($550K)| Healthcare 401k: $6K (New) HSA: $11K ($4K) Emergency Fund: $18.5k ($15.5K) Churning Points: 1M (60% UR, 40% MR) Student Loan: $6k at 3.15% **Portfolio Breakdown (Last Year’s)** VTSAX or equivalent 57% (82%) Individual stocks (GOOG, NVDA, NBIS, ASTS, RDDT): 41% (12%) Bonds 2% (3%) Cash 0% (3%) **Income History** I worked a lot of part time jobs from 2011 to 2015 but didn’t file taxes so.. the income history is missing there. 2015: 13k 2016: 26k 2017: 42k 2018: 75k 2019: 115k 2020: 135k 2021: 170k 2022: 181k 2023: 266k 2024: 353k **401K Contribution History** 2018: Employer Match: $0.8k, 401k: $5.4k, After Tax 401k: $7.9k 2019: Employer Match: $3.9k, 401k: $19k, After Tax 401k: $23k Rollover from other company 401k (2016-2018): $21.2k 2020: Employer Match: $4.4k, 401k: $19.5k, After Tax 401k: $27.5k 2021: Employer Match: $5.5, 401k: $19.5k, After Tax 401k: $28350 2022: Employer Match: $10.25k, 401k: $20.5k, After Tax 401k: $29k 2023: Employer Match: $11.25k, 401k: $22.5k 2024: Employer Match: $11.5k, 401k: $23k, After Tax 401k: $34.5k 2025: Employer Match: $11.75k, 401k: $23,5k, After Tax 401k: $11.1k **401K Sources (Total now $694k as of 10/09/25):** Roth In Plan Conversion: 42.76% Pre Tax: 36.87% Employer Match: 13.15% Rollover: 7.17% Roth Rollover: 0.05% **Milestones of Savings:** 2019: 100k 2020: 200k 2021: 300k 2022: 400k 2023: 500k, 600k, 2024: 700k, 800k, 900k, 1M 2025: 1.1M, 1.2M, 1.3M **Links** Year by Year Expenses [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHUBjlPyMSfXC28NqFPiDhceNfCrG\_FCuzLkr2Nga1Y/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHUBjlPyMSfXC28NqFPiDhceNfCrG_FCuzLkr2Nga1Y/edit?usp=sharing)",236,96,2025-10-10 16:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1o35dfg/year_update_after_1m_laid_off/,2025-10-23 09:08:35.608256,0.45,$T,0.5,[],[],0.9999999999999999
T,1nvpvso,wallstreetbets,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket. [“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b) Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish: 1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**. 2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos. 3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect. I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps. Now, I’ll keep it real with you: * Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical. * Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things. * User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue. * CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times. **Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits. **Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks.",339,229,2025-10-02 00:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,2025-10-23 09:06:38.708249,0.45,$T,1.0,['SNAP'],"['bull', 'puts', 'moon', 'yolo', 'revenue']",0.9285714285714285
UNH,1ntszqs,ValueInvesting,Forget the hype: This is where I am invested today,"First of all: AI is a fart in the wind (the way it is today). I work as a scientist for a large US tech company where management tries to enforce AI. But literally nobody uses AI tools. Or should I say, nobody has become more productive with existing tools. It takes more time to correct codes generated than writing from scratch or leveraging existing codes. It does help here and there, but NOTHING disruptive. I save maybe 3h of work per week, and I am being super generous. Not even talking about the infinite revenue loop created between the main AI actors. Time reveals everything, and this is no exception. Now, there have been several posts on '*where to invest today? what are your strong picks in a period of ATH?*' So writing here where I have invested a large portion of my value portfolio, waiting patiently that money flows back. Here it is: **US insurance providers**. I have USD 110k invested as of today. Why? PE lower than usual, high revenue growth and money likely rotated from the sector to stupid AI. I have collected the best ones (according to me) such that you do not have to. Criteria: low PE (and lower than usual), high and consistent revenue growth, profitable, growing or constant margins, continuous stock price increase with a decrease in the last year (so not ATH), large cap: * Chubb * PGR * ACGL * AJG (okay PE is does not match the criteria above, but it systematicall increases over time with performance, so still invested in) * Optional: TRV * UNH * ELV **High risk (not fitting the above criteria, but could go to the moon):** * LMND * ROOT Cherry on the cake: such portfolio has outperformed the SP500 in the last decade while being less affected during downturn periods. Insurance is not going anywhere, it is a necessity that grows with demographics and increased frequency of large events. Sector has underperformed but money will come back.

T,1o3iy4l,investing,Drawdowns are Normal and Expected,"Saw a lot of chatter about the downturn in the market with the China tariff noise. As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward. We tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. We will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. Similar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. The downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. Of course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. And for the love of god, stop pulling funds out because the other candidate won. Left, right, it doesn’t matter. Over the long run buying and holding is the best strategy you can make, even if you buy at an all time high. Solar did better under Trump 1 and oil/gas did better under Biden. It never works out how we plan it with administrations coming in talking about wanting to push certain sectors. Moral of the story? Just keep buying if you’re a long term holder. If you’re getting older, you likely want to introduce more “safe” and “stable” assets into your mix. A 20/80 for a 75 year old who expects to live 10-15 more years is much more suitable and would provide more utility to this age demographic versus a 25 year old who can fairly safely go 100% equities and weather the volatility along the way.

T,1nz1a6l,wallstreetbets,Constellation Brands,"Hi all, If you have seen my previous post, you know I am no stranger to losing money. I have been doing some research on STZ and wanted your opinion. Currently, STZ has been in a free fall due to some of their late guidance clueing us in on a tapering demand for beer in younger generations. The myth here is that younger generations aren’t drinking— this is wrong in my opinion. I think the large part of STZ beer losing marketshare is that younger folk are opting for ready-to-drink beverages (White claw, Twisted Tea, etc) and craft beer (IPA, Local, Regional beer alike.) While STZ brings us our legacy Modelo and Corona brand beer. Going to the store I’ve noticed the tag for a 12 pack of modelo has risen to about 21.99 in Arizona. During covid, I remember a 12 pack being about 16.99, and a 6 pack 10.99(now 13.99). Rising prices could bode lower demand from customers despite resilient elasticity of demand. Consumer spending is also restrained— people may opt for cheaper beer but beer drinkers also tend to be purists and pay a premium for the beer they already love. STZ also will be presenting the first reflection of the recent tariff hike on Aluminum cans which they’ve already hinted at a 20 basis point reduction over the next 3 quarters. STZ is also facing boycott from Canadians on the back foot of the Tariffs the Trump org imposed on Canada(Me being vague here). Additionally— some GPT math, a mild miss could impact the P/E and still cause a 10% one day drop. The company would have to miss EPS by 150 million(2.40 EPS) to be considered severe and warrant a 20% drop. — Also they have declared a dividend on top of their share buyback. Buyback value is 4 billion — posing a 15% reduction in shares. $600M already reported to have been bought. Dividend of 1.04– shares to be counted on October 30th. The firm is definitely playing defense in the face of turbulent conditions, providing incentives to shareholders. A dip would also be helpful for those that want to get in before the dividend. — I have to wonder if betting on a dip would be a good choice( Looking at 10/10 expiry)— on the other hand it could be already priced in. The stock has dropped significantly since all of the above combined factors and early self reporting by Constellation. I guess the big question is do you think it’s priced in already? If there’s something I missed, please educate me. Edit: I should also add that this ER is reporting a quarter that is generally strong from a seasonal standpoint. >> UPDATE Alright I just found out these Jerrys sold some of their wine out of their portfolio last quarter for 900M, which would cover them about 50-70 basis points from the reported 2.9 EPS last quarter. Historically Q1 to Q2 EPS bumped 40-80 basis points in the past 3 years due to summer sales. In order to hit the consensus 3.40 estimated EPS, they would need a 100 basis point bump Q/Q. This quarter they will be missing revenue from the wine they sold, so unless they divest more I don’t see them hitting earnings. I think yall will see me buying puts tomorrow. >>UPDATE 2 I may be getting crushed however, the reported EPS is 2.6. Robinhood has posted the comparable eps of 3.6 We shall see I guess, Im a bit cheesed.",33,65,2025-10-05 21:52:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nz1a6l/constellation_brands/,2025-10-23 09:06:38.706022,0.45,$T,1.0,[],"['puts', 'earnings', 'dividend', 'dip', 'rally', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.84
T,1obruch,ValueInvesting,"Most comprehensive DD on a future tenbagger, deep value under the radar company that Peter Lynch would like is $PROP an oil and gas company","Prairie Operating Co (PROP) is an energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States. They have 60+ employees now, not 19 and do most things inhouse now after the Bayswater acquisition. Biggest risks with PROP are Series F redemptions and management not executing. Series F preferred stock being redeemed into common shares will dilute shareholders badly but management will use their credit facilities and cash flow to pay off Series F holders in cash. Debt for preferred stock is on PROP balance sheet right now and PROP just needs to pay off the stock with debt from somewhere else like from RBL and the high yield debt market. So the debt would stay or be a little higher in the balance sheet but there would be no more dilution. PROP sold preferred shares and warrants to fund a 600m acquisition of assets in the DJ basin from Baywater. PROP had a market cap of 200m before the acquisition but is valued at 100m today. Oil exposure is well hedged through early 2028 so there is no commodity pricing risk. Management wouldn’t let PROP holdings be diluted as insiders own 30% - 50% of the company. The co-founders and executive team are very large equity shareholders. PROP has publicly stated that they are working towards eliminating the dilution overhang associated with the preferred stock. Series F holders may convert all or a portion of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock at any time but they wouldn’t do that as they are collecting a 12% dividend for holding preferred shares. They also wouldn’t dare to do an ATM at this bad valuation. PROP has access to borrow a maximum of 475m from a Reserve-Based Lending (RBL) Credit Facility. They currently are borrowing 386m which helped fund the Baywater assets acquisition. They also owe 129m to Series F holders. Series F will need to be paid off all at once to prevent massive shareholder dilution. With a new evaluation coming in the next month or two, PROP should be able to borrow more than 85m from RBL and they can borrow the rest from the high yield debt market. They will be able to get a loan with all the assets they have including 1.3b in proven oil reserves. Total oil reserves could be 2.4b but only proven oil reserves qualify for a RBL loan. The loan limit will be raised because the rate set for PROP was lower than industry standards. The rate was set that way because PROP was not a proven executor and with Q2 results they have proven themselves. AI is driving really profound growth in data centers and all that electricity is predominantly being generated by fossil fuels. So there is still demand for oil and gas. The oil and gas industry is not dying. PROP is excellent at acquisitions and buys them at 2 to 2.5 multiples. They are always looking for deals. And competitors are paying a 4 or more multiple on acquisitions. PROP revenue reached 68.1m in Q2 2025. Production reached about 21,000 barrels of oil per day. PROP's goal is to get to about 100,000 barrels a day. They produce on average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day so far. By the end of 2025 with their 600m acquisition the output should be much higher. They have hedges covering 85% of PDP production for 2025 through 2028 for an average price of $65 a barrel. Future barrels are hedged at least at $60 a barrel. PROP will spend 300m a year on capex. In 2026, the cash flow that they generate is going to exceed that capex. PROP’s will do dividends or buybacks in the future after they deleverage and pay down debt. Their goal is to return value to their shareholders and keep leverage lowering than the competition. Colorado has an abundance of electricity from renewables. Colorado also has strict emissions/pollution standards. Partnership with ProFrac gives Prairie access to an electric frac fleet allowing hydraulic fracturing and pump down operations to be fully electrified. The fleet will be equipped with electric blender units, hydration systems and chemical additive units all powered by 100% natural gas and not diesel. Prairie wants all operations from drilling to production to be fully electric. -------- I compared the Q2 results of many other oil and gas companies and one AI company to PROP and as you can see PROP is completely undervalued fundamentally especially compared to APLD. https://imgur.com/a/oQowUoO -------- Prairie Operating Co. was co-founded by Gary C.

There's no way in hell they will let themselves be diluted into oblivion. -------- I have compiled and edited the best bits of various interviews PROP did in the past few months. I used audio transcription software and grouped together similar information. Everything below is from interviews. I don't think what people understand is that everything that we basically use is a product of oil. The world runs on hydrocarbons and it's across the board. Plastics, medicines and so on. The majority of electricity that's driven by hydrocarbons is primarily from natural gas. So I think without oil, we would be in heap trouble and lost as a society without it. We think that hydrocarbons are going to fill that energy void of datacenters. Oil is super cheap right now. We think there's a super cycle coming maybe as soon as the fourth quarter of 2026 and maybe a little bit beyond that. 2026 is really the transition year where we break into cash flow positivity and we generate more cash than our capex. We are still growing acreage. I think we're up to 60,000 acres now. We intend to keep growing that organically. Those leases are our lifeblood to the future. We try to keep a 10-year inventory of up to 5,600 well locations in our inventory at any given time that we can permit over the course of a year. We think there's a lot of farmout potential to do with Oxy and Chevron. We have constant dialogues with them about projects that we're working on. They look at our cost structure relative to theirs, our takeaway capacity that we have contracted, our ability to manage and produce water because we control our own saltwater disposal systems, things that even them at their size do not have, at least in that particular area. -------- **Compiled information related to costs.** The more we underwrote the Permian, the more we came to the conclusion that the returns that other acquirers were satisfied with were low double digits. Whereas in the DJ Basin, we saw returns that were substantially higher than that, really driven by two things. The lower cost to acquire assets and then just the drilling economics. The rocks in the DJ Basin in the Codell and the Niobrera are really easy to drill compared to the Permian. In Colorado, where we are, we drill these two mile lateral wells between 4-5 days. By comparison in the Permian, it takes 10-14 days to drill a similar well. And we've been able to drive down all the other costs associated with drilling, starting with the frack fleet. We're blessed with approximately 600 drilling locations. 20% IRR to over a 100% IRR per location. Costs between 5.2 to 5.4 million to develop a well. All the way down from 6.5 to 7 million when we were starting the company. We're running one rig full time, which translates into drilling about 60 wells per year. We've paid as little as $10,000 to $100,000 for a proven location to drill in the DJ basin. In the Permian basin, people are paying millions of dollars for the same location, same economics. They're spending $3 to $5 million just to buy that location. We put most of our products (oil, gas and water) directly into pipelines from production. We have access to about 40 megawatts of power that no one was really using from windmills and other renewables. It's a lot cheaper to use electricity than burning a lot of diesel, which has helped drive our cost structure really low. Our competitive advantage is tremendous out here, especially at $60 oil or $55 oil. We think we can produce profitably down into the 40s, probably the low 40s, but after that, we're just not going to drill wells at $42. -------- **Compiled information on Baywater, 600m acquisition** We grew about 9x to 10x through the Bayswater acquisition. We went from 14 people to 62 people. The integration has gone really great. We went from relying on consultants to whom we outsource a lot of what we do before the deal to now bringing it inhouse. We setted up our own systems from the ground up which is great because we didn't inherit someone else's accounting system and someone else's land system. We didn't have to figure all that out. We took about 90 days to integrate Baywater assets. We've moved on towards optimization of the assets that we acquired. We've been doing gas lift optimization projects. We also have been doing workovers which we'll continue to do between now and the end of the year. We've got some low hanging fruit to exploit some inefficiencies in the assets and get a little bit more productivity out of them. So at the time we did the last acquisition, which was a $600 million acquisition. It was more than 10 times the size of our company. A minnow swallowing a whale kind of a deal, it's tough to finance that. We got a great bank syndicate together led by Citibank to fund most of the deal. Our preferred shareholders come in for $150 million to finance the rest of that deal. We have the ability to redeem this financing. We're now significantly larger than at the time we did that acquisition. Not only as a result of having done the acquisition, but also because we're growing substantially through the drill bit. And as a result, we have access to lower cost of capital. We're working tirelessly to eliminate the overhang of the preferred stock. I would point investors to the fact that very little of the preferred investment has actually converted into shares. -------- The oil and gas industry is the least expensive industry on the SP500, yet generates the greatest amount of cashflow as a percentage of business than any industry on the SP500. There is no energy transition, only an energy addition. I think we're a mispriced industry. There's just not an unlimited inventory of cheap oil. We don't need a huge reinvestment in the energy sector to see a huge re-rate in oil and gas prices. All we need is a little bit of capital flowing back into this sector to see these prices jump 10%, 20%, 30% in short order. We think there's a fundamental scarcity value to the commodity. We're running out of inventory. And that's why we're trying to get our hands on every great location we can. From the beginning, our plan has been to consolidate the DJ Basin and to build a high-growth company, through acquisitions and through the drill bit. We've done eight acquisitions in just the last two years. But we're now beginning to grow significantly through the drill bit. We really just started that program in April and May of 2025 after our last acquisition, which is our largest acquisition. And so we're really hitting exit velocity going in the back half of this year into next year where we see a future where our cash flows start to surpass our capex. And we're all about returning capital to shareholders. We ourselves are large investors in the company. We love dividend income. So that's our focus. We are under-levered compared to a lot of peers. We have no intention to become over-levered. Our vision is to continue consolidating, but also to top off and return cash flow. The stock is trading very low with the market assuming full conversion of $129 million of the preferred shares. But we're not afraid that that's going to happen because of our ability to buy out the preferred shares. And the financial markets are suppressing the price of oil. We've got a really historic level of shorts in the market. But none of the facts on the ground really reflect it. There's fear of this OPEC glut. If there was going to be a glut of oil from OPEC, you would have already seen it in the storage numbers and you're not seeing them. So I think there's a lag in terms of the market catching up with reality. We're experiencing that lag right now. And make no mistake, based on historic movements, this commodity can shoot up $20 or $30 over a very short period of time. We're putting our money where our mouth is. Every window of opportunity we have, we're all buying stock, even though we own a lot of it to date. Not every executive on the team is required to file a purchase. We remain excited about the M&A environment. We're at a great financial position. We're really well hedged. We've got nothing but good things to look forward to as a company.",37,31,2025-10-20 19:53:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1obruch/most_comprehensive_dd_on_a_future_tenbagger_deep/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.003304,0.45,$T,0.6,['PROP'],"['dividend', 'shorts', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'sec filing', 'acquisition']",0.84
T,1nzd00j,wallstreetbets,LandBridge DD but not really,"🌱 LB Future Outlook & Catalysts to Watch LandBridge (LB) is quietly morphing from a niche Permian land play into a diversified infrastructure + energy real-asset story. If execution goes well, the next 2–5 years could unlock multiple new revenue streams and reprice the stock higher. Here’s what’s driving optimism (and what to watch closely). ⸻ 1. Data Center / Power + “Powered Land” Strategy One of the biggest recent catalysts is LB’s strategic agreement with NRG Energy to explore development of a data center + natural gas power project in Reeves County, Texas (Delaware sub-basin). ￼ • The project contemplates a 1,100 MW grid-connected facility, with air permit and electrical interconnection applications already underway. ￼ • If successful, this will let LB leverage its acreage not just for oil & gas development, but for digital infrastructure — anchoring more stable, long-term cash flows. ￼ • In short: LB is transforming from a royalty/land play into a “powered land” platform, where land + infrastructure coincide. ￼ This is a long timeline (2029+ estimates for operations), so the market is just beginning to price in optionality. ￼ ⸻ 2. Long-Term Surface / Pore Space Contracts (Operator Partnerships) LB isn’t relying solely on speculative infrastructure. They’re actively locking in multi-year contracts with operators to secure recurring income. • A notable deal: a 10-year surface use and pore space reservation agreement with Devon Energy. This gives Devon guaranteed access to LB’s subsurface (pore) space and surface rights in parts of the Delaware Basin. ￼ • Part of that deal includes minimum volumes for produced water handling, which can be a consistent revenue driver. ￼ • These contracts help reduce volatility in LB’s cash flows by ensuring that LPs and operators commit to long-term usage rather than one-off deals. ￼ As LB accumulates more acreage and locks in more contracts, it builds a more defensible revenue base. ⸻ 3. Strong Q2 / Recent Financial Momentum LB has delivered encouraging results recently, which gives credibility to its growth narrative. • In Q2 2025, LB reported ~83% YoY revenue growth and strong margins. ￼ • Surface use royalties in that quarter were a standout component. ￼ • The company reaffirmed its guidance for 2025 and demonstrated liquidity strength. ￼ The fact that LB is executing in its core business gives more weight to its forays into data centers and power. ⸻ 4. Strategic Moves & Market Access • Dual listing on NYSE Texas: LB announced a second listing on the NYSE Texas exchange in mid-2025. That may help boost liquidity and visibility, especially among Texas & energy investors. ￼ • Land acquisitions / acreage growth: The company continues expanding its footprint. More land gives optionality for future leases, infrastructure, or data center sites. ￼ • Analyst & market interest: Some analysts are assigning a target of ~$67, roughly ~20% upside from current levels. ￼ • Short interest & sentiment: Approximately 16–17% of LB’s float is sold short (per MarketBeat), which means that a positive catalyst could trigger a squeeze element. ￼ ⸻ 5. Key Risks & Execution Hurdles No thesis is complete without risks. For LB’s future to play out: • The NRG data center / power project must cross significant regulatory, permitting, and customer contract hurdles. If any link fails, the project is delayed or canceled. • The long-term contracts (like the Devon deal) must translate into tangible cash flows; if operators underutilize them, LB might underdeliver. • Commodity & energy cycle risk remains. If oil/Gas prices collapse, operator activity could slow, reducing new lease demand. • Small-cap volatility: as a newer public company, LB is more susceptible to sentiment-driven swings and liquidity stress. • Multiples & expectations: The market might already have priced some of this optimism into LB, so disappointment could mean multiple contraction rather than fundamental collapse. ⸻ 6. What to Watch & What Could Trigger the Next Move • Official updates on NRG / data center / power project permitting and power purchase agreements. • Execution and capital progress on the Devon agreement (volume commitments, water handling). • Q3 / Q4 earnings showing whether revenue from recurring contracts is ramping. • Acreage additions, new lease deals, or partnerships in energy infrastructure or digital infrastructure. • Institutional inflows and whether short interest begins to cover in a gamma squeeze dynamic. ⸻ Bottom line: LandBridge is positioning itself beyond just a land-royalty play. The data center + power ambition, combined with long-term operator contracts, gives it multiple levers of growth if things execute cleanly. The next 12–24 months will be critical — but if LB gets its bets right, it’s not unreasonable to see the optimism priced in begin to compound and start to see prices up around $80+ per share. The “Golden Cross” on the 2H chart are very promising in the up coming days My position idea is torn between either 200 contracts of $65 strike or 100c $60sp for expiry 11/24. Pretty sure the math works out that the 60c is better… but of course if you’re planning on a target of ~$85+, then the $70sp is tempting. Not financial advice.

T,1nrqj71,stocks,"Railroads magnates, what do you think of the 85bln $ merger between UNP and NSC merger?","TLDR: Railroad haven’t performed very well in the past years but may still be a solid investment. Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity? Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs. Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term. Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution. However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

T,1noy49y,ValueInvesting,Crocs stock - value trap?,"Hey everyone! Long time lurker, and longer time value investor. I’ve had a position in Crocs for some time now. Disappointed with the recent dip, but I believe the market has oversold pretty heavily. I’m considering adding to my already heavily allocated (as a % of my portfolio) position. The company has been growing revenue and cash flow for quite a while now. They’ve been buying back shares and paying down the debt from the HeyDude acquisition aggressively. While the acquisition has panned out as a bit of a disappointment (see the recent impairment), it has undoubtedly taken the company to another level. They are forecasting revenue declines for the current quarter which hasn’t helped the stock price. All that being said, this company is selling at dirt cheap multiples. Even adjusting for the revenue decline, it will be one of the most undervalued cash flow streams in the market. The balance sheet is relatively healthy, and I’m expecting them to announce having purchased 2-3% of outstanding shares during this quarter - as the price is deflated. They have shown significant international sales growth despite the slow down in the Americas. Their shoes are priced at some of the lowest levels versus most of their competitors AND they still get a higher margin than most of them. The management team has even advised part of the revenue decline is due to a pull back in promotions to preserve brand integrity. On the HeyDude side, revenue has been showing notable declines - although a bullish investor can attribute this to a shift in business model to drive D2C sales at higher margin than HeyDude’s wholesale strategy. I wanted to gather this community’s thoughts. Is their last report and this current quarter the start of the end? And therefore the market is pricing their stock accordingly? Or is this a true value play with blood in the streets and far too negative market sentiment for a historically great company (and one that still looks to be a good deal even if revenue declines over the next 5-10 years).

T,1oapgm7,ValueInvesting,Crude Awakening: My Portfolio of Post-Bankruptcy Drillers and Debt-Fueled Pipe Dreams!,"Hey r/ValueInvesting, Oh wise sages of the discounted cash flow spreadsheets and eternal moat hunters, I come to you humbly (lol, jk) seeking your enlightened judgment on my little portfolio comprised of oil rigs, tankers, and whatever else floats (or sinks) with commodity prices. I mean, who needs boring old consumer staples or tech darlings when you can ride the wild waves of cyclical glory? And hey, with a little bit of leverage thrown in (check that ~23% margin, living on the edge!), I'm sure this is exactly the kind of ""deep value"" setup that would make Warren Buffett weep tears of joy. Here's the rundown for your dissecting pleasure: - FTAI Infrastructure (FIP): 10.8% weight, beta 1.96, critical infrastructure. Hi, we're here because nothing says stability like extremely leveraged infrastructure, desperately in need of refinancing. Anyway, we have a powerplant to feed your datacenters so idiots on the internet can keep making AI-Slop, wanna bail us out? - Seadrill (SDRL): 10.6%, beta 2.16, offshore drilling. Hi, we owns super expensive ships that drill holes in the ocean. We went bankrupt during the pandemic, everyone still hates us despite having all our assets but none of the debt, someone buy us please and end the misery. - Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGAL): 10.0%, beta 1.48, commerical banking. Hi, we're Argentina's largest bank, due to the volatility around our government's recent reforms, we've been able to absolutely fleece our customers, literally bleeding them dry with superhigh interest rates, even as the rates we paid on deposits collapsed, but now ohm, if Javier Milei's parti doesn't win in the midterms next week, WE DIE. - Weatherford International (WFRD): 9.5%, beta 1.51, oilfield services. Hi, we also went bankrupt but now we're cutting costs so it probably won't happen again... Maybe. We don't have any expensive assets but we're really good at helping you get oil outta the ground. - Noble Corporation (NE): 9.5%, beta 1.11, offshore drilling. Hi, we're almost exactly like Seadrill, we also went bankrupt, but now we're back and paying DIVIDENDS!! We also have much better rigs, don't tell Seadrill tho, they're sensitive about that... Pussies. - Valaris (VAL): 9.4%, beta 1.15, offshore drilling. MOOOAR DRILLING!!!! No but seriously, Hi, the only difference between us and the other two, is we have even more rigs, infact, we're the biggest of them all, don't expect any dividends tho, that's Noble's thing, we never return cash, we hoard it until we find some way to burn it, shareholder returns are gay. Oh yeah and we also went bankrupt. - Kirby Corporation (KEX): 8.7%, beta 1.01, marine transportation. Hi, we're Kirby, no, not the fucking Pokemon, fucking weebs, anyway, we transport mainly bulk liquid cargoes like crude oil and chemicals via America's inland waterways, like the Mississippi river. Right now our stock is in the toilet because both of our two major customer groups suck, lucky for us, all our small competitors are doing worse, so we'll probably buy them cheap. No, we're not acting monopolistic, who said that, fuck you! It's healthy corporate consolidation. - Scorpio Tankers (STNG): 8.7%, beta 0.02, product tanker operator. Wait, low beta? Must be a glitch in the matrix. Anyway, Hi, we own big ships that move refined products like gasoline and diesel around between the refineries and the end customers. What's that? Couldn't you just refine it where it's needed? That's adorable Europe, but we all know you won't be doing that because refineries are gross, so how about you just shut the fuck up and keep shipping it in from Asia and occasionally we fleece the fuck out of you when there's suddenly a lack of ships available. - Cactus (WHD): 8.6%, beta 1.48, oilfield services. Hi, we're a bit like Weatherford, except we didn't actually go bankrupt, making us pretty unique amongst this fucking bunch of degenerates, anyway, unlike those sluts over at Weatherford who'll jump on just about anything to get work, we just make valves, we call them trees but they're valves. Care to keep your shit controlled and in the ground after you've punched a hole through to it, call us up and we'll ""plant a tree"", see how good that sounds, we're basically the Greta Thunberg of oil services. - GeoPark (GPRK): 8.0%, beta 0.77, oil & gas exploration. Hi, we're a Columbian oil company who recently completed an acquisition of two oil blocks in Argentina, we also used to have some projects in Ecuador, don't ask about that. Basically, if you're a country in Latin America and politically unstable, we'll drill ya. - TORM (TRMD): 7.0%, beta 0.09, product tanker operator. Hi, we're almost exactly like Scorpio. Please god just let Hafnia buy us, competition sucks, why can't we just have a Kirby situation. - Vale (VALE): 6.3%, beta 0.74, iron ore mining. Hi guys, we're here too, not really sure why, something about a bet on a rebound in Chinese construction, anyway, DIVIDENDS! - New Fortress Energy (NFE): 5.9%, beta 1.27, natural gas utility. Hi, we're run loosely by the same group of people who run FTAI Infrastructure, as such, we're leveraged out the ass but we might be beyond the point of saving, if you wanna play here, prepare to have your ass raped (without lube) by our creditors if and when we probably, most likely, almost certainly, file for bankruptcy. - Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK): 5.3%, beta 0.95, marine transportation. Hi, we're a bit like the tanker guys but instead of gasoline and diesel, we move shit like rocks and grain around, we have a ton of ships so we should be pretty valuable right? Ship values matters right? RIGHT?! - Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR): 4.6%, beta 0.83, integrated oil & gas. Diiiiiviiideeends... I mean Hi, anyway, dear god please just don't let Lula fuck this up, we have a good thing going, just leave us alone and we'll pay you dividends forever. Don't think about how sustainable those dividends are with oil prices at current levels, we're basically the treasury of Brazil, such minor obstacles as oil prices don't really matter to us. Weighted average beta: 1.44 (because who wants market-matching when you can amplify the thrills?). Sector exposure: 81.8% energy, because balance is for wimps. And yeah, total adds up to more than 100% due to that sweet sweet margin allowance. Rate my masterpiece on a scale of ""Graham would approve"" to ""This is why retail investors lose money."" Bonus points if you can explain why this isn't the ultimate value play without mentioning ""cyclical"" or ""leverage"" (spoiler: you can't).

T,1nzynm7,ValueInvesting,The common guidelines on how to navigate the current market….,"… this is my opinion only. And meant for “basics/getting started” investors. The market will drop 10% or more every 2-3 years and drop 20% or more every 5 or 6 years. During the bad years of 1973, 2001 and 2008, it was successive years of 10-30% declines. - If you did not buy your existing stocks expensive, and if your investing horizon is long, and if you did not borrow to invest, then you do not need to do anything but perhaps figure out how to raise cash to buy more stocks if and when there is a general decline in prices. - if you bought stuff at the top, borrowed money to invest, and if you only know price action and volume and nothing else about the underlying business (ie. you are a momentum chaser) think about how to reduce risk BEFORE the music stops and the stampede for the exit starts. You will not have an edge against the big boys with faster computers, and larger sell orders than you. - your edge as a value investor is your ability to ignore the market, and buy when the prices go down. Remember, a general market decline is not there to guide you but for you to exploit it. - valuation matters. Quality of the business also matters. A popular fast growing company that is heavily in debt or has no earnings is more likely to do badly than a slow growing boring company that is generating a lot of cash. It is also true in recovery: a higher quality company will recover its Share Price faster than a low quality company. You should have a watchlist of owned and WTB stocks and the prices you will buy more at. Do this once and check every quarter to validate your assumptions. This will help you prioritise what to buy and perhaps what to sell to raise cash. —— Remember the 6 “P”s: proper planning prevents piss poor performance. Not timing the market doesn’t mean you don’t plan.",15,18,2025-10-06 23:15:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nzynm7/the_common_guidelines_on_how_to_navigate_the/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.266282,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'volume']",0.8114285714285714

T,1nr9tx1,ValueInvesting,"Are We Underestimating the Long-Term Compounding Power of ""Unsexy"" Companies in a World Obsessed With Tech","Most conversations in today’s investing world—both in mainstream media and even here on r/valueinvesting tend to orbit around technology: AI, cloud, semiconductors, platform businesses, etc. And for good reason: these sectors are driving innovation and often have compelling growth narratives. But it got me thinking: are we collectively undervaluing the potential for long-term compounding in industries that are more “boring” but still essential to modern economies? Consider examples like waste management, railroads, specialty chemicals, or niche industrial parts suppliers. These firms often: -Operate in oligopolistic markets with high barriers to entry. -Have recurring, sticky demand regardless of economic cycles. -Generate significant free cash flow, which gets returned to shareholders or reinvested efficiently. -Benefit from inflation pass-through in ways investors don’t always price in. -When you zoom out, a business growing earnings at 7–10% annually for decades—without major disruption risk—might actually outperform many higher-growth, higher-volatility tech bets (especially if bought at a fair valuation).

T,1nzgoi4,wallstreetbets,YOLO (19M) OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES,"Hello everyone, I’m not sure if this fits perfectly here, but I wanted to share my story and analysis. I’m a college student who’s had an incredible year in the market — my portfolio has grown by about **240%**, and I’ve managed to stay consistent along the way. I started investing with **$50,000**, a gift from my dad who wanted me to learn the markets firsthand. We come from a financially comfortable background, but this account is one I’ve managed entirely on my own. My dad oversees our main family portfolio, while I handle this joint account independently. It hasn’t been all wins — at one point, I hit rock bottom with my portfolio dropping to **$32,000**, down 36%. I learned the hard way about stop losses getting triggered while I slept and the importance of risk management. But those lessons shaped how I trade today. Now, I’d like to share my analysis on **Open door (OPEN)** — why I’m investing in it, what I believe its upside potential is, and the reasoning behind my conviction. Hopefully, this can offer some insight for others looking at the stock from a similar perspective. For the people who are scared that the market is overinflated, sure that makes sense but imagine that 20 years ago people had to call brokers for an average person to buy stocks, but now through many institutions and businesses such as Robinhood, Fidelity, and more. People have gained easy access to stocks, I think that is the reason for a big part of this inflated looking numbers. Also from what I understand it will only be up from here. I am currently invested in 190k in Opendoor at an average cost of $8.06, but I have re-entered my position after initially being in at $2.46-$3.9 and having full ported then as well. But now I have diversified somewhat and am creating money off of their and taking out more margins, all or nothing in this world. In **September 2025**, Shopify’s former COO **Kaz Nejatian** took over as CEO — and he’s coming in swinging. Stock ripped **\~80%** right after, volume hit nearly **1 billion shares** in a day, and the guy is literally taking **$1 per year** in salary. Everything else he earns is in stock. * **83M shares** in total awards * Vests only if the stock price stays above key levels (like $6.24 for 60 days) * “Double-trigger” clause: if OPEN gets bought out at **$25+**, vesting accelerates Kaz only wins if shareholders win. That’s exactly the kind of alignment I want to see. * **Lennar ($LEN)** – One of the biggest homebuilders in the U.S. ($34B revenue, \~20% margins). They’ve partnered with Opendoor before and are clearly in for the long term. * **Berkshire Hathaway** – Owns \~$780M of Lennar. Not a direct OPEN stake, but Buffett money near the ecosystem always matters. * **Robinhood** – Their CIO literally said “Opendoor will not be forgotten.” Vlad Tenev even responded within *an hour* to OPEN’s new CEO. Robinhood’s shifting from a broker to a fintech bank — imagine the synergy if they start providing liquidity for real estate. * **Jane Street** – Just disclosed a **5.9% stake (44M shares ≈ $362M)** in OPEN. That’s not retail hopium — that’s institutional math buying in. The Fed is estimated to **cut rates by 75 bps before year-end**. Guess which sector benefits the most when borrowing costs drop? Housing and home-financing platforms. Lower mortgage rates = more home sales = more Opendoor volume = more revenue. They basically run on transaction flow, so rate cuts are jet fuel for them. Even with hedge funds like **AI Liquid** and **Wheeler** unloading \~$328M in shares, the stock’s been **rock-solid at $7–9**. Big players sold yet the price held. That’s bullish strength. Catalysts - * New CEO has massive equity incentives and a proven track record from Shopify. * Institutional eyes (Jane Street, Robinhood execs, etc.) are watching closely. * The rate-cut cycle will give housing tech a new wave of life. * OPEN’s tech edge makes it the **Robinhood of real estate** — fast, digital, and scalable. * Strong partnerships with Lennar and others give it real-world leverage. At the end of the day I believe that a good CEO is important and Kaz is not a bad one, I think that he has changed and become more reactive within this company more than ever, so I will invest in it. I sadly cannot touch options yet because 1 I do not trust myself but 2 my dad did not allow it within his account so I am restricted by Robinhood but long calls are not expensive from what I am seeing. I will also prove to you guys I am 19 if you are jealous, but I know I am only a drop is this massive ocean.",0,133,2025-10-06 11:41:26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nzgoi4,2025-10-23 09:06:38.702878,0.45,$T,1.0,['LEN'],"['bull', 'calls', 'yolo', 'rally', 'volume', 'revenue', 'loss']",0.74

My fair value calculation** **if** Precovid, the sales and earnings were meh, **and** post covid the growth were 3-5% a year helped by increased hygiene awareness, inflation, and price increases **BUT** the company is having growth issues **then** what sort of growth guidance should i use ? i would model for a realistic long term growth of 3%, and this is generous because pre-covid sales are stagnant, eps was only growing at 1.2% a year. This is a good balance between post-covid realitities but also not so optimistic to use analyst growth numbers found above. I will use Dec 2025 estimate of EPS guidance of 3.6. i will assume Colgate will grow earnings at 3% a year forever, helped by a growing middle class, and in developing countries, people will brush their teeth more (to quote the Barron's article: “In urban India, 80% of people don’t brush twice a day, and in rural areas, only half brush daily, she said.""), the 3% EPS growth will also covers buybacks. Fair value calculation: (3.6 x (1+3%) ) / (discount rate - long term growth rate) discounte rate is 9% for me, the weighted cost of capital is closer 7.0% = (3.6 \* (1.03) / ( 9% -3%) = $61.8 the Fair value price is $61.8 The current Share price = $78 if i were to use a 5% growth for 10 years duration, the implied value is $73. I suspect that is what investors are expecting, ie >5% growth. **7. Conclusion:** I would want to buy CL at a deeper discount, as the street is pricing the business at growth rates that i think is not sustainable. (The ceo has only been running this company since 2019, but has been in the company for the last 38 years. I don't expect him to make too much changes to the growth algorithmn of Colgate. ) On the other hand, if i were to pursue this company, i would do a Gordon Dividend Model, ie buy based on dividend and don't look for share price appreciation. This is a stable boring 200 year old company that people have bought for dividends.

T,1o2775s,ValueInvesting,PROP - a turnaround oil and gas stock in the making,"**updated today, 10/22/25** Prairie Operating Co (PROP) is an energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States. They have 60+ employees now, not 19 and do most things inhouse now after the Bayswater acquisition. Biggest risks with PROP are Series F redemptions and management not executing. Series F preferred stock being redeemed into common shares will dilute shareholders badly but management will use their credit facilities and cash flow to pay off Series F holders in cash. Debt for preferred stock is on PROP balance sheet right now and PROP just needs to pay off the stock with debt from somewhere else like from RBL and the high yield debt market. So the debt would stay or be a little higher in the balance sheet but there would be no more dilution. PROP sold preferred shares and warrants to fund a 600m acquisition of assets in the DJ basin from Baywater. PROP had a market cap of 200m before the acquisition but is valued at 100m today. Oil exposure is well hedged through early 2028 so there is no commodity pricing risk. Management wouldn’t let PROP holdings be diluted as insiders own 30% - 50% of the company. The co-founders and executive team are very large equity shareholders. PROP has publicly stated that they are working towards eliminating the dilution overhang associated with the preferred stock. Series F holders may convert all or a portion of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock at any time but they wouldn’t do that as they are collecting a 12% dividend for holding preferred shares. They also wouldn’t dare to do an ATM at this bad valuation. PROP has access to borrow a maximum of 475m from a Reserve-Based Lending (RBL) Credit Facility. They currently are borrowing 386m which helped fund the Baywater assets acquisition. They also owe 129m to Series F holders. Series F will need to be paid off all at once to prevent massive shareholder dilution. With a new evaluation coming in the next month or two, PROP should be able to borrow more than 85m from RBL and they can borrow the rest from the high yield debt market. They will be able to get a loan with all the assets they have including 1.3b in proven oil reserves. Total oil reserves could be 2.4b but only proven oil reserves qualify for a RBL loan. The loan limit will be raised because the rate set for PROP was lower than industry standards. The rate was set that way because PROP was not a proven executor and with Q2 results they have proven themselves. AI is driving really profound growth in data centers and all that electricity is predominantly being generated by fossil fuels. So there is still demand for oil and gas. The oil and gas industry is not dying. PROP is excellent at acquisitions and buys them at 2 to 2.5 multiples. They are always looking for deals. And competitors are paying a 4 or more multiple on acquisitions. PROP revenue reached 68.1m in Q2 2025. Production reached about 21,000 barrels of oil per day. PROP's goal is to get to about 100,000 barrels a day. They produce on average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day so far. By the end of 2025 with their 600m acquisition the output should be much higher. They have hedges covering 85% of PDP production for 2025 through 2028 for an average price of $65 a barrel. Future barrels are hedged at least at $60 a barrel. PROP will spend 300m a year on capex. In 2026, the cash flow that they generate is going to exceed that capex. PROP’s will do dividends or buybacks in the future after they deleverage and pay down debt. Their goal is to return value to their shareholders and keep leverage lowering than the competition. Colorado has an abundance of electricity from renewables. Colorado also has strict emissions/pollution standards. Partnership with ProFrac gives Prairie access to an electric frac fleet allowing hydraulic fracturing and pump down operations to be fully electrified. The fleet will be equipped with electric blender units, hydration systems and chemical additive units all powered by 100% natural gas and not diesel. Prairie wants all operations from drilling to production to be fully electric. -------- I compared the Q2 results of many other oil and gas companies and one AI company to PROP and as you can see PROP is completely undervalued fundamentally especially compared to APLD. https://imgur.com/a/oQowUoO -------- Prairie Operating Co. was co-founded by Gary C. Hanna and Edward Kovalik, who currently serve as President and Chairman/CEO, respectively. As of October 2025, Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ: PROP) has 50.28 million common shares outstanding Board of Directors / Management / Co-founders owned at least 6,303,082 shares. I did not go through all the sec filings to find the rest. If the Series F shares are redeemed. Not only do the insiders lose millions they also would fail to gain the hundreds of millions that they would have gained from eliminating the dilution risk. There is a very very high chance the Series F preferred shares will not be redeemed. Insiders like Jonathan H. Gray have recently bought shares as recently as this September. Name | Shares Owned ---|--- Edward Kovalik | 2,037,035 Gary C. Hanna | 2,038,206 Jonathan H. Gray | 1,065,975 Gregory Scott Patton | 798,519 Richard N.

There's no way in hell they will let themselves be diluted into oblivion. -------- I have compiled and edited the best bits of various interviews PROP did in the past few months. I used audio transcription software and grouped together similar information. Everything below is from interviews. I don't think what people understand is that everything that we basically use is a product of oil. The world runs on hydrocarbons and it's across the board. Plastics, medicines and so on. The majority of electricity that's driven by hydrocarbons is primarily from natural gas. So I think without oil, we would be in heap trouble and lost as a society without it. We think that hydrocarbons are going to fill that energy void of datacenters. Oil is super cheap right now. We think there's a super cycle coming maybe as soon as the fourth quarter of 2026 and maybe a little bit beyond that. 2026 is really the transition year where we break into cash flow positivity and we generate more cash than our capex. We are still growing acreage. I think we're up to 60,000 acres now. We intend to keep growing that organically. Those leases are our lifeblood to the future. We try to keep a 10-year inventory of up to 5,600 well locations in our inventory at any given time that we can permit over the course of a year. We think there's a lot of farmout potential to do with Oxy and Chevron. We have constant dialogues with them about projects that we're working on. They look at our cost structure relative to theirs, our takeaway capacity that we have contracted, our ability to manage and produce water because we control our own saltwater disposal systems, things that even them at their size do not have, at least in that particular area. -------- **Compiled information related to costs.** The more we underwrote the Permian, the more we came to the conclusion that the returns that other acquirers were satisfied with were low double digits. Whereas in the DJ Basin, we saw returns that were substantially higher than that, really driven by two things. The lower cost to acquire assets and then just the drilling economics. The rocks in the DJ Basin in the Codell and the Niobrera are really easy to drill compared to the Permian. In Colorado, where we are, we drill these two mile lateral wells between 4-5 days. By comparison in the Permian, it takes 10-14 days to drill a similar well. And we've been able to drive down all the other costs associated with drilling, starting with the frack fleet. We're blessed with approximately 600 drilling locations. 20% IRR to over a 100% IRR per location. Costs between 5.2 to 5.4 million to develop a well. All the way down from 6.5 to 7 million when we were starting the company. We're running one rig full time, which translates into drilling about 60 wells per year. We've paid as little as $10,000 to $100,000 for a proven location to drill in the DJ basin. In the Permian basin, people are paying millions of dollars for the same location, same economics. They're spending $3 to $5 million just to buy that location. We put most of our products (oil, gas and water) directly into pipelines from production. We have access to about 40 megawatts of power that no one was really using from windmills and other renewables. It's a lot cheaper to use electricity than burning a lot of diesel, which has helped drive our cost structure really low. Our competitive advantage is tremendous out here, especially at $60 oil or $55 oil. We think we can produce profitably down into the 40s, probably the low 40s, but after that, we're just not going to drill wells at $42. -------- **Compiled information on Baywater, 600m acquisition** We grew about 9x to 10x through the Bayswater acquisition. We went from 14 people to 62 people. The integration has gone really great. We went from relying on consultants to whom we outsource a lot of what we do before the deal to now bringing it inhouse. We setted up our own systems from the ground up which is great because we didn't inherit someone else's accounting system and someone else's land system. We didn't have to figure all that out. We took about 90 days to integrate Baywater assets. We've moved on towards optimization of the assets that we acquired. We've been doing gas lift optimization projects. We also have been doing workovers which we'll continue to do between now and the end of the year. We've got some low hanging fruit to exploit some inefficiencies in the assets and get a little bit more productivity out of them. So at the time we did the last acquisition, which was a $600 million acquisition. It was more than 10 times the size of our company. A minnow swallowing a whale kind of a deal, it's tough to finance that. We got a great bank syndicate together led by Citibank to fund most of the deal. Our preferred shareholders come in for $150 million to finance the rest of that deal. We have the ability to redeem this financing. We're now significantly larger than at the time we did that acquisition. Not only as a result of having done the acquisition, but also because we're growing substantially through the drill bit. And as a result, we have access to lower cost of capital. We're working tirelessly to eliminate the overhang of the preferred stock. I would point investors to the fact that very little of the preferred investment has actually converted into shares. -------- The oil and gas industry is the least expensive industry on the SP500, yet generates the greatest amount of cashflow as a percentage of business than any industry on the SP500. There is no energy transition, only an energy addition. I think we're a mispriced industry. There's just not an unlimited inventory of cheap oil. We don't need a huge reinvestment in the energy sector to see a huge re-rate in oil and gas prices. All we need is a little bit of capital flowing back into this sector to see these prices jump 10%, 20%, 30% in short order. We think there's a fundamental scarcity value to the commodity. We're running out of inventory. And that's why we're trying to get our hands on every great location we can. From the beginning, our plan has been to consolidate the DJ Basin and to build a high-growth company, through acquisitions and through the drill bit. We've done eight acquisitions in just the last two years. But we're now beginning to grow significantly through the drill bit. We really just started that program in April and May of 2025 after our last acquisition, which is our largest acquisition. And so we're really hitting exit velocity going in the back half of this year into next year where we see a future where our cash flows start to surpass our capex. And we're all about returning capital to shareholders. We ourselves are large investors in the company. We love dividend income. So that's our focus. We are under-levered compared to a lot of peers. We have no intention to become over-levered. Our vision is to continue consolidating, but also to top off and return cash flow. The stock is trading very low with the market assuming full conversion of $129 million of the preferred shares. But we're not afraid that that's going to happen because of our ability to buy out the preferred shares. And the financial markets are suppressing the price of oil. We've got a really historic level of shorts in the market. But none of the facts on the ground really reflect it. There's fear of this OPEC glut. If there was going to be a glut of oil from OPEC, you would have already seen it in the storage numbers and you're not seeing them. So I think there's a lag in terms of the market catching up with reality. We're experiencing that lag right now. And make no mistake, based on historic movements, this commodity can shoot up $20 or $30 over a very short period of time. We're putting our money where our mouth is. Every window of opportunity we have, we're all buying stock, even though we own a lot of it to date. Not every executive on the team is required to file a purchase. We remain excited about the M&A environment. We're at a great financial position. We're really well hedged. We've got nothing but good things to look forward to as a company.",8,12,2025-10-09 14:19:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2775s/prop_a_turnaround_oil_and_gas_stock_in_the_making/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.243767,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'shorts', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'sec filing', 'acquisition']",0.74
T,1ntrlou,investing,Dividends + Margin Account = Growth machine?,"(TLDR at the end, this is a long post) So I had an idea, but it feels wildly too good to be true, and before risking my assets into a fool’s errand, I’d like to aggressively stress test it. I welcome all criticism and really want to build a strongman argument for (or against) it before moving forward. I have been wracking my brain trying to find fault in it, and while I can see some obvious pitfalls, they have yet to convince me **not** to go forward. First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress. The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x. For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max. This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen). Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size). Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario: **Aggressive Scenario** Initial cash: 30k Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k This gives me a potential buying power of 590k. Using 95% of it on day 1 : 560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following: \-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity). Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01. At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable. And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true. A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me. **A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) **B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.** Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months. **C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above** Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key. **D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off** In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore. And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this? TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

T,1nuop9u,stocks,Nvidia Stock Manipulation,"Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful. Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end…. It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation. 112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this. I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year. So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it ‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good.

T,1oc3ycm,ValueInvesting,Value Trap - Google,"Google has often been called a value stock, but I see it as a classic value trap, especially now, for the people touting it as one. This subreddit is fixated on the company's historical dominance and massive cash flow, yet continues to fails to fully price in the risks threatening its OG business model. Google's profits: 1. Are fundamentally tied to the cost per click advertising model within search. This generates most of their money, and relies on a user being directed to a page where they are exposed to multiple ads. This is now under direct attack. Just because it is still growing, doesn’t mean that it’s not going to fail. It can take a long time to stop a massive, powerful train. I believe there is momentum that is having ad revenues grow, while also being cut into, and that will continue, until the train is off the rails for this portion of profits. 2. The shift toward AI is the main threat. When we use AI, even Gemini, we are seeking a single response, not a scavenger hunt across ten different websites, regardless of the sources are available. Most people are stupid and are done after the first response. If Google is forced to embed these simple AI summaries into its main search to maintain relevance, two things happen: Increased cost for AI results instead of the OG results. This means less profit for them. AND revenue loss. Google users need to click on ads decreases because their question has already been answered. This is headed towards becoming obsolete for Google (and anyone’s) most profitable ad format in history. Other issues: Googles cloud is under pricing its services and investing billions in infrastructure just to try and play catch up. They’re going to get their lunch eaten by Azure and AWS. Waymo and other parts of this company are high risk start-up type bets and we are forced to invest in them when buying Google. Google is notorious for creating things and throwing in the towel and spending their money poorly (the opposite of Amazon - imagine if Amazon had Google cash flow, what they’d do with it. Oh wait, they won’t, because they actually know how to reinvest properly). Also, regulatory hurdles. Google has a target on its back still. People just don’t like them.

T,1nxsfij,ValueInvesting,Capital B is like btc in 2011,"Why Capital B deserves attention among Bitcoin equities Capital B is quietly building what MicroStrategy made famous but doing it in a cleaner, more disciplined and fully European way. Here’s what sets it apart. 1. Pure Bitcoin exposure Capital B’s balance sheet is made up entirely of Bitcoin - 100 %. No trading, no derivatives, no hedging. The company doesn’t speculate, it accumulates. Its only goal: increase the number of sats per share over time. The purest publicly-listed Bitcoin play in Europe. 2. Regulated European structure Listed on Euronext Paris, Capital B operates under full EU regulation (AMF, IFRS, AML). Institutional investors, funds and individuals can gain Bitcoin exposure without self-custody or U.S. regulatory risk. It bridges traditional equity markets and the Bitcoin economy. 3. Zero debt, zero leverage Unlike MicroStrategy (levered with billions in convertibles), Capital B carries no debt at all. No margin calls No liquidation risk No dilution spiral. An unlevered treasury built to survive any bear market. 4. Value-accretive capital raises When Capital B issues new shares, it does so at a premium to NAV. That means every raise increases the BTC per share ratio for all holders. It’s one of the few listed companies where new capital = higher intrinsic value. 5. Long-term investor base Roughly 62 % of shares are held by long-term investors : founders, strategic funds (TOBAM, Fulgur Ventures), and early Bitcoin figures like Adam Back. This creates a natural volatility buffer: when weak hands sell, the core doesn’t. Few Bitcoin equities have a shareholder base this stable. 6. Transparency & proof of holdings Regular public updates include: Bitcoin holdings Average purchase price Share count/NAV Treasury changes Anyone can verify the real BTC per share - a level of transparency most ETFs don’t offer. 7. Small-cap asymmetry With a market cap near €100 – 150M (depending on BTC price), Capital B still has high convexity. A doubling of Bitcoin’s price could easily mean more than a doubling of the stock due to scarcity, liquidity, and sentiment effects. The early-stage version of what MicroStrategy became after its first BTC cycle. Capital B = Europe’s clean Bitcoin treasury. 100 % Bitcoin exposure 0 % debt / 0 % derivatives Regulated & transparent 62 % held by long-term investors High convexity + low structural risk It’s not a meme stock — it’s a disciplined Bitcoin treasury built for the next decade.

T,1nwg9lu,ValueInvesting,Securities analysis is a deluded fallacy. ( Under the current monetary regime.),"Don’t shoot me, I’m just a messenger. However, my assertion is quite straightforward: Under our current monetary system, which relies heavily on hyper-stimulated credit injections into the economy, securities analysis and business valuation have become almost irrelevant. This is due to the unreliable nature of economic calculations caused by central banking monetary policies. The financial economy serves as the primary conduit for central banking policies. Financial assets experience an initial surge in value before the underlying economy has fully assessed the viability of capital investments. This disconnection fuels the boom, leading to further capital misallocation into speculative ventures with minimal real demand or profit potential. Essentially, stocks rise and continue to rise due to the influence of the Federal Reserve. Wall Street exacerbates this situation through its marketing and pressure-selling tactics. After all, Wall Street’s primary revenue streams are securitization and trading. As the boom continues to grow and persist, Wall Street’s wealth increases accordingly. Therefore, professional investors, most hedge fund managers, financial gurus, social media promoters, and most “professionals” in finance are essentially opportunistic beneficiaries of easy money and loosened credit injections into the financial markets. For instance, consider Warren Buffett’s case. In 1980, he was worth $500 million and was already one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Back then, there were only 13 billionaires worldwide. Fast forward 40 years, and Warren Buffett’s net worth has skyrocketed to $150 billion, while the global number of billionaires has increased to 3,000. Simultaneously, the value of the dollar has declined by nearly 74% in the same period. This means that while savers have been impoverished, asset holders have experienced significant wealth effect. And you wonder why you can’t afford a home Millennial!!! (lol) The value of Buffett’s wealth is not solely attributed to his exceptional stock-picking abilities but rather to his long-term investments in high-quality financial assets added and abetted by inflation. All these financial metrics and accounting calculations are meaningless in an inflationary environment. However, accountants, CPAs, CFAs, academics, MBAs, and other investment experts need to earn a living, so they market their systems, books, newsletters, and other products to the public. Essentially, the entire investment industry is somewhat a pyramid scheme built on easy money. The moment the Federal Reserve reduces its money supply, the entire system collapses quickly. Fortunately for the Wall Street professionals and gamblers , the current neo-Keynesian academics at the helm of the Federal Reserve have no intention of ever cutting off the flow of money and credit. Therefore, the boom may continue and spread to other tokenized vehicles and investment schemes. The good news is that you can simply buy and hold great businesses and forget about it. Cash is toxic! By the way, Ben Graham operated under a more sound financial system, similar to Natural Finance under the Gold Standard. Since 1971, the world has entered an era of inflation and a fiat financial system. Securities analysis and economic calculation cannot be conducted in the same way in both regimes.",0,22,2025-10-02 21:14:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwg9lu/securities_analysis_is_a_deluded_fallacy_under/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.279818,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['rocket', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7171428571428571

However unless I have cash on hand to buy the dip that can’t really be done and to have cash on hand I’d have to risk missing out on returns now which may lead to less returns overall if a major dip doesn’t come soon. Big believer in the whole more money is lost hedging for a downturn than in the actual downturn. As an alternative to holding cash Iv been exploring holding leveraged funds during a downturn. Looking at charts of TQQQ it has had some enormous gains overall. Ik Ik it’s been an incredible bull run and that might not continue but not considering buying at highs and holding forever. Instead I was thinking something like at 10% draw back of QQQ shifting contributions to TQQQ which would make up a really small portion of my portfolio then every couple weeks re evaluate. If it continues to drop keep contributing to it. At say a 30% drop start shifting holdings to TQQQ and so on buying all the way down. As an exit strategy I would sell and put it back to normal allocations of S&P500 international, etc. once market returns to a new ATH or maybe just hold 1 more year.

T,1o2fjw4,ValueInvesting,Policy-driven mispricing? NAT might be an overlooked hard-asset play before U.S.–China ship fees kick in ⚓️📈,"Looking at Nordic American Tankers (NAT), I think there’s an interesting asymmetry forming in a part of the shipping market that most people ignore. Here’s the setup: The U.S. will start enforcing a new fee regime on ships linked to China (by build, ownership, or operation) starting October 14th. The goal is to counter China’s shipbuilding dominance and redirect demand to non-Chinese fleets. (CBP Policy Release) Most analysts (BIMCO included) think it won’t move the overall market — fair enough. But Suezmax crude tankers, which mainly serve the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic routes, don’t have the flexibility to simply “redeploy.” If even a small portion of Chinese-built or Chinese-operated Suezmaxes avoid U.S. calls, supply tightens locally — and compliant operators capture the spread. NAT is one of the cleanest public exposures to that thesis: • 20 Suezmax ships, only one built in China (rest Korea/Japan) • Low-cost operator, very transparent financials • Trades around $3.30/share, roughly 1.3× book • Net debt ≈ $350M vs. equity ≈ $485M → leverage under 1× • Dividend history of 100+ consecutive payouts (currently $0.10/share) • Insider alignment — CEO and his son have been buying more shares If rates on compliant Suezmaxes normalize from $25K/day to even $40K–$60K/day, NAT’s free cash flow could more than double. Historically, that kind of environment pushes book multiples closer to 1.5×–1.6×, implying fair value in the $7–$8 range. This isn’t a fast-growth story. It’s a hard-asset business that could benefit from policy friction — similar to how tariffs or regulations can distort supply-demand balance for a few years at a time. And you’re paid a double-digit yield while waiting for the market to reprice it. Risks: • U.S. could delay or water down the fees (though guidance and payment rails are already in place). • Oil demand or VLCC oversupply could blunt Suezmax margins. • Shipping cycles can turn quickly. The upside: You’ve got a policy catalyst, a scarce fleet class, insider alignment, and real assets backing the stock. If nothing happens, you collect yield. If the policy sticks, the rerate could be 2–3× over the next couple of years. Not investment advice — just curious if anyone else sees this as a case of policy-driven mispricing in a tangible-asset business.",7,2,2025-10-09 19:36:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2fjw4/policydriven_mispricing_nat_might_be_an/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.238947,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'dividend']",0.7114285714285714
T,1npnv31,ValueInvesting,"How capitalism will collapse run away from money, run toward gold now","There’s a huge job market crisis, the threat of AI, and people are scared of the future. What happens next? People afraid of what’s coming don’t want to hold money anymore they put it into safe assets. They buy gold. The dollar drops in value. Yes, I think people should abandon the dollar the paper money that companies and the rich hoard. It’s useless in this economy. Hoard gold. Hoard real assets. Companies keep generating profits, quarter after quarter, but they don’t hire people. They just grow richer and more independent from workers. But are they really? If being rich is measured by how many paper dollars you own, they can become poor overnight if people simply refuse to value paper money. If 99% of the money belongs to the rich, then the poor should just stop using it. Leave paper money behind. I read that 100 years ago, the amount of gold an average person could buy with their salary was much higher than today. That shows how worthless paper money has become. So leave paper money and buy tangible assets gold, and others with real value. Companies can multiply paper money endlessly, but they can’t control limited assets. This is the era of walking away from useless paper money. Young people will never be able to buy a home with paper money. Go for gold, go for limited assets, go for things with real value. Yes, companies generate profits but don’t hire anyone. Fine. Then I opt out of this system. I won’t hold my savings in paper. Every salary they pay me, I convert into gold or other tangible assets. They pay us with paper shit that’s worth less and less in this economy. So keep only the bare minimum of paper for basic needs and save the rest in gold. That’s something they can’t print, can’t multiply, can’t control with interest rates. Protect yourself from latestage capitalism, because money will keep losing value. As companies hoard all the paper money, let them. We, ordinary people, should leave them with their useless paper while we hold gold and real assets just like before they tricked us into replacing real value with worthless paper. Today, gold is the back swan event, because the dollar will soon collapse. Companies hoard all the profits, house prices in dollars are insanely high, and paper money is worth nothing. I go to work, I get paid a salary and that only makes sense as long as, in some reasonable perspective, I can afford a house. A big house with a pool, not a rat-sized apartment for 3 million. But young people today? They’re supposed to believe that if they just keep their jobs jobs that might not even be taken over by AI they’ll maybe afford a house in their 50s or 60s. Paper money is worth nothing. The real Black Swan event that people don’t even see is this staying away from paper money. Buy assets. Buy value.

UNH,1nwondf,ValueInvesting,Most Value Investors Under perform in the long run.,"Hey All, I want to make it clear from the beginning, I am no one to criticize anyone else. I just want to express my humble opinion on value investing. Please take this in the best manner, i have no intention to come off as rude, arrogant or overall just a real annoying critique. I think most people read graham or maybe the new value investors don't because of shortened attention spans. Look what worked for graham was only true because the markets were wholly inefficient and he just applied common sense, buffets early partnerships made some changes and showed signs of the shift to quality but mainly went of graham principles. Munger changes that of course, and today i believe that is really the right way to go. Most value investors statistically underperform; they just get caught up in the whole cheap thing, which is just outdated, and is a lot harder to make greater returns on. Spin offs special situations such things are not really my cup of tea, my thoughts on quant in value investing is that if dcf and the rest of qaunt analysis were so great, anyone with a computer and some algorithms would be making great returns. the former is of course not true. What is true is finding high quality businesses with competitive advantages and barriers of entry that can be bought at a reasonable fair price. For this one must accumulate insanse amounts of knowledge to be ready when such a opportunity arises, they must research like Li Lu's famous timberland story, and 99% won't. I think that there is oppurtunity, just not for those looking for net - nets for the most part, its just a lot more difficult and the odds are not in your favour. The talks on microsoft and other big names are fine, but 20x earnings is not reasonable, and beyond tech stocks what are the real competitive advantages of LULU for example since thats trendy, i never see that. Maybe i am biased to Munger, but the numbers back him, the logic and common sense as well. Just my thoughts.

Explain this to me like I’m a 5 year old… I will give a little background on my understanding of Bitcoin/crypto. I have had many in person conversations with people who love Bitcoin and claim it is the future. For the last 11 years since being introduced to it, I just don’t get it as nobody has been able to explain it to me. It just comes one big frustrating circle jerk. I have heard one decent use for Bitcoin, and that is for wiring money outside of the country at a lower transaction fee compared to wiring money. Great! I can wrap my mind around that, as that is a $35B US market. I understand that traditional currency will get devalued over time due to printing more money. Bitcoin only gets divided as time goes on and no more will be released after a certain date. This is a great theory. So I am now trying to possibly avoid losing 3% due to inflation and the devaluing dollar. Sure no more Bitcoin will be created, but new crypto ( or shit coin ) gets created every day. I know, I know, I know all shit coins go down to zero which just leaves Bitcoin. But still, to think Bitcoin can’t be replaced just like AOL, Yahoo, Friendster etc.. would be pretty short sited. This is not a point I am trying to debate or learn about. ??????????????? Question… how is Bitcoin suppose to be better than traditional currency? After all, the value of Bitcoin here in the US is based on the USD. I have heard many argument made by crypto lovers that the USD is shit. If the USD is shit, then what’s the point of Bitcoin if it is directly correlated to the USD. Maybe the better question is, what will it take to drive actually utilization of Bitcoin on a more accepted basis? I’ve never walked into a store and saw a price tag on an item that said the cost of this item is .00025 bitcoins. I have not heard of any jobs paying their employees at .00016 bitcoins per hour Even if there was, that cost and profit margin would have been based on USD calculations. Again, I’m not saying Bitcoin or crypto has no utility. I just don’t know why 90% of the population or more actually needs crypto vs a credit card or even cash. This is not a topic on “ Cash is going away “. That will be a separate thread once I am convinced of the utility and stability of Bitcoin. I also can’t stop thinking about AOL, Yahoo, Friendster, MySpace, Skype etc… but these example show that I am thinking crypto in general has a future. Also not to be debated here.

T,1o8dl46,ValueInvesting,Looking for the bear case on GENDA (TSE: 9166),"I have been studying GENDA (TSE: 9166) and am trying to find clear reasons why it might not be a good investment at the current valuation. Usually, with roll-up companies, there are obvious concerns around debt, dilution, or weak integration, but GENDA seems more disciplined than most. **Business context** GENDA operates mainly in Japan’s entertainment sector, focusing on arcades, karaoke, and related businesses. The company has completed roughly 30–40 acquisitions since its 2019 inception. Its environment is unusually favorable: * Many small and medium-sized Japanese businesses lack a successor due to the aging population. * The domestic M&A market is far less competitive than in the US, allowing GENDA to buy quality businesses at low valuations. * Much of their debt is fixed at around 1.5%, which has kept financing costs very low. * The entertainment industry is highly fragmented, creating consistent roll-up opportunities. Because of these factors, GENDA has built a strong reputation as a reliable and aggressive buyer which many businesses would be happy to sell to (they're the ""buyer of choice"", as they put it themselves). Average acquisition multiples have ranged from 2.5x to 8x EV/EBITDA, typically around 4.5x. As a result, revenue has grown roughly 40% year over year. One way to look at potential upside is that GENDA is acquiring companies at 3–6x EV/EBITDA while its own stock trades around 12x. That spread, combined with consistent integration, supports compounding value creation over time. **North America expansion** Recently, GENDA has expanded aggressively in North America, acquiring two large arcade operators. One of them was National Entertainment Network (NEN), purchased at around 3.5x EV/EBITDA. After introducing Japanese IP-focused machines, sales on average doubled across upgraded locations. This shows that they are not just acquiring earnings but also improving the operations of acquired businesses. Considering that this is quite a slow and arguably boring sector, I think such numbers are really impressive. It also shows the interest that Western (or at least North-American) people seem to have in Japanese-inspired prizes. **Management and capital allocation** The management team includes veterans from Aeon Fantasy, SEGA Sammy, and Bandai Namco, and one co-founder previously worked at Goldman Sachs Japan. Their investor communication is unusually transparent for a Japanese company. They often explain the expected return on each acquisition, including detailed ROIC assumptions,. Historically, GENDA financed acquisitions mostly with debt and sometimes equity. As of September 2025, they announced a shift toward funding future M&A and organic growth entirely through operating cash flow. This likely reflects their leverage level of about 2.5x net debt/EBITDA, which is near their internal limit of 3x. They indicated that debt could again be used once EBITDA increases. **Valuation** GENDA currently trades at around 18x forward P/E and 14x next year’s P/E, and roughly 9–12x EV/EBITDA. For a company growing earnings by about 40% year over year, this seems low. Of course, much of that growth comes from acquisitions, but organic improvements have also been very meaningful, as the NEN example shows. Still, it is an unconventional business. Arcades, karaoke, and character IP are not exactly predictable markets. That said, these are established industries in Japan — and increasingly in the US — rather than short-lived trends or hypes, so I don’t see a high risk of the whole concept collapsing. My question is: what are the key risks that make this valuation justified? Where could this roll-up strategy break down? I always try to find reasons not to buy a stock and usually succeed, but in this case the combination of disciplined execution and relatively low valuation makes it hard to see the expected value as anything other than positive.",1,3,2025-10-16 18:08:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o8dl46/looking_for_the_bear_case_on_genda_tse_9166/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.029270,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['bear', 'earnings', 'support', 'revenue', 'acquisition']",0.6285714285714286
T,1oblpgz,ValueInvesting,PDD’s operating profit fell 28.5% year-on-year in H1 2025. Does this mean its high growth and profitability are no longer sustainable? Or could it all have been a fraud?,"Most of you probably know PDD already, so I’ll keep the intro short. PDD’s success is built on the group-buying model, letting users team up to buy the same product at a lower price. By aggregating massive demand, PDD could negotiate better deals and offer cheaper prices than anyone else. Rivals like JD and Alibaba tried to copy PDD’s model with Jingxi and Taote, but both failed to achieve similar scale. Once their subsidies ended, prices rose and users left. Until 2025, PDD seemed unstoppable: growing fast, staying highly profitable, and keeping its balance sheet lean. **In H1 2025, revenue growth slowed to 8.6%, and operating profit fell 28.5%. What went wrong?** From what I can tell, two things happened at once: 1. China’s 2025 Electronics and Home Appliance Subsidy Program, which PDD couldn’t fully take advantage of 2. Political pressure forcing PDD to change how it treats merchants Both factors hit margins hard. **1. China’s 2025 Electronics and Home Appliance Subsidy Program, which PDD couldn’t fully take advantage of** In January 2025, China rolled out a [massive new stimulus program](https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xxgk/zcfb/tz/202501/t20250108_1395564.html) aimed at boosting domestic consumption. The policy offered: * Up to 15% subsidies (capped at RMB 500 per item) for electronic products * Up to 20% subsidies (capped at RMB 2,000 per item) for home appliances. Sounds great, right? But PDD couldn’t actually benefit from these government subsidies. Instead, it had to fund similar discounts from its own pocket just to stay competitive against JD and Taobao. Why? Because most merchants on PDD are small to medium-sized sellers, and the subsidy rules made it extremely difficult for them to qualify. To participate, sellers had to: * Sell only products that met official energy or water efficiency certification standards (for home appliances) * Upload valid manufacturer serial numbers * [Undergo delivery verification](https://sww.sh.gov.cn/swdt/20250226/4ce64e7425c0476dbc43eca7c8f7a237.html), meaning the delivery driver had to take photos and record product IDs to prove the buyer received the item. These measures were introduced to prevent subsidy fraud, but they also created a huge administrative and compliance burden. Worse still, merchants had to [advance the subsidy from their own cash flow](https://stcn.com/article/detail/1393379.html) and wait months for government reimbursement, which created a significant burden for small sellers with limited liquidity. So naturally, most small merchants chose not to participate, and PDD had to pay the subsidies out of pocket to keep prices competitive. Meanwhile, JD had no such problem. JD sells directly from its own inventory and works with large brand flagship stores, the exact kind of merchants that do qualify for the subsidies. So JD ended up being one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government program, while PDD took the hit. **2. Political pressure forcing PDD to change how it treats merchants** The second major headwind likely came from government pressure. In 2024, hundreds of merchants [protested ](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3272437/chinese-suppliers-storm-temu-office-guangzhou-protest-over-harsh-policies)outside PDD’s office, accusing the platform of unfair treatment. They said customer-merchant disputes were handled opaquely and always favored buyers. Some claimed they were fined heavily or forced to refund customers without requiring the goods to be returned. Given how sensitive the Chinese government is to social unrest, PDD probably faced strong pressure to fix these issues quickly. Since then, the company has pivoted hard toward merchant support. It launched a series of initiatives to improve relations with sellers, including fee reductions, logistics assistance, and softer penalties. Most notably, in April 2025, PDD announced its [“100 Billion Support Program,” ](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-03/doc-inerwrzr1503992.shtml)committing RMB 100 billion (around USD 14 billion) over three years to help merchants lower costs and improve product quality, smart for the long run, but it is hitting short-term profits hard **So, what is the likely outcome of this crisis? Can PDD return to growth and profitability?** . . . \[Check out the [full post](https://compoundingcompetence.substack.com/p/pdds-operating-profit-fell-285-year?r=60rv48&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) on my Substack if you’d like to dive deeper\]",3,0,2025-10-20 15:28:10,https://open.substack.com/pub/compoundingcompetence/p/pdds-operating-profit-fell-285-year?r=60rv48&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true,2025-10-23 09:08:12.008257,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['rally', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.6228571428571429
T,1o7yjt3,ValueInvesting,Update on Conrad Shipyards (CNRD),"$28 per share 5.01 million shares out $140 million market cap $17.2 million TTM earnings 8.1X trailing PE $249 million in backlog as of June 2025, down slightly from $293 million in backlog in December 2024 I wrote up Conrad Shipyards in June, and the stock is up 75% since then. I’ve been adding to the position since June, it’s gotten quite large, but I’m still holding and I still think it’s a decent buy even at these levels. Link to the last write up: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/eqTISdmPZE Conrad Shipyards is one of 5-6 shipyards in the U.S. which focuses on small and medium sized vessels. Others include Bollinger Shipyards, Metal Shark, Swiftships, Nichols Brothers Boat Builders, and Senesco, but all of these are private. The story has played out nicely. Shipbuilding has high fixed costs, so there is huge operating leverage when revenue improves. The company has swung from a negative gross profit in H1 2024 of -$9.4 million to positive gross profit in H2 2025 of $25.6 million, and operating margins went from -6% to positive 6%. The backlog is down slightly from December 2024 but was still quite healthy as of the last quarterly report, with about 9 months of backlog baked in. As I wrote previously, the company was capital constrained due to multiple bad years for the shipbuilding industry. There is a concept called “bonding capacity” which is critical in shipbuilding, where a surety bond issuer issues a bond to ensure the customer gets the ship they paid for and all the subcontractors still get paid if the primary contractor (Conrad) goes out of business. In the most recent quarterly report, they mention that they have improved their financial condition and improved their bonding capacity. So they should be able to expand their shipbuilding capacity going forward. Cash on the balance sheet continues to grow and now sits at $46 million, with only $2 million of debt. Net working capital sits at $51 million, and book value sits around $91 million. The Trump admin announced in April a Section 301 investigation into China’s shipbuilding and “unfair maritime practices”, with a plan to create a “Maritime Action Plan” by November 5, 2025. So we’ll see if this plan actually comes out, and what it looks like, but it seems like a major catalyst is on the near term horizon. One of the big drags has the been the increase in steel prices in 2025 on the back of steel tariffs. Hot rolled coil prices jumped to the high $900/ton range, but have since moderated to the mid $800s. So it’s still a risk to watch out for but we haven’t seen continued rises in input costs. The company was initially awarded a contract for a Navy Yard, Repair, Berthing, and Messing barge back in March 2022, with options for up to 7 additional barges. Based on the sub commentary from r/Navy on the Conrad deal, the Navy was desperately in need of new barges (https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/s/hMwsvFvai1). In December 2024, the company got a $28 million contract for a 9th barge, and in June 2025, they got a contract for a 10th. The company has a history of making good dredging barges, and won several awards in the past year for these boats. They also continue to get contracts from municipalities such as New York for the new Governor’s Island ferry and Puerto Rico for multiple passenger ferries. But the most interesting new contract they got was from a startup called Blue Water Autonomy for a long range, autonomous ships. https://youtu.be/2DU79wXL4n0?si=n3-YjjT-vGRdaB4I Blue Water plans to build a whole fleet of autonomous ships for mine detection and surveillance, and Conrad was selected as the shipyard for Blue Water’s new ships. As one of the few domestic shipyards that makes small boats, Blue Water only has a few options for a domestic shipyard for these boats. Congress has already allocated $2 billion for medium sized unmanned surface vehicles, and Blue Water seems pretty ambitious in its goals. If Conrad delivers on this first boat to satisfaction, they could get a lot more follow on orders from Blue Water, which could bring in a lot of additional revenue. Right now it is still at a little over 8x trailing earnings, with about 30% of the market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. They have a history of doing buybacks from 2010-2017, but haven’t done in any in years because earnings haven’t been that good. Now that there is cash accumulating on the balance sheet again, I’d expect the buybacks to start up again which is another catalyst on the horizon.

T,1nu98m1,ValueInvesting,"Railroads magnates, what do you think of the 85bln $ merger between UNP and NSC merger?","TLDR: Railroad haven’t performed very well in the past years but may still be a solid investment. Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity? Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs. Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term. Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution. However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

JPM,1nppu6c,ValueInvesting,The Case for Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX),"Got into Amneal at around $2 in late October of 2022 and am still holding after my 400%+ gain because I believe the stock still has room to grow significantly. JPM recently raised PTs to $14 and GS to $12 as the company begins to develop a significant foothold in the specialty and affordable medicines space. I believe the stock will continue to increase due to these 3 reasons: 1. AMRX trades at a discount to peers on EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples. If execution continues, re-rating toward peer multiples alone could justify $12–$15/share 2. Historically, Amneal was weighed down by debt post-merger. Stronger operating cash flow, refinancing (just completed this summer) at lower rates, and paydown efforts are improving the capital structure 3. The company has over 100 ANDAs pending, including complex generics that carry greater barriers to entry. Recent FDA approvals and launches (GLIADEL Wafer, biosimilars like Releuko and Fylnetra) show execution capability and most importantly... LEADERSHIP!!! Amneal is co-led by two CEOs, Chirag and Chintu, who have an incredible grasp on the pharma space and have the entire company ""bought in"" on their mission. Amneal went public via a merger in 2018 and peaked at around $24 before crashing by over 90%. Chirag and Chintu, who were on the Board of Directors at the time, returned post-crash and began to assemble a new leadership team, which has resulted in significant growth over the last 5 years.

I know past performance does not predict future too, meaning that international market could beat USA in the future and I’m heavy in U.S large cap right now.

T,1oab0cn,ValueInvesting,Thoughts on DEFT (DeFi Technologies)?,"I’ve been digging into DeFi Technologies (DEFT in the U.S., DEFI in Canada). The company is basically trying to be the bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. They’re building out exchange-traded products that give investors exposure to digital assets, plus asset management and infrastructure plays in Web3. A few things that caught my eye: • Q2 revenue around $32M with positive EBITDA and net income. • AUM is close to $900M and growing. • Just secured $100M from institutional investors. • Analysts like Maxim Group have Buy ratings with targets well above where it trades now. The obvious risk is they’re tied directly to crypto market cycles and regulation, so this isn’t a safe bet. But if they keep building AUM and scaling their ETP lineup, this could be a solid speculative way to play the next leg of digital-asset adoption. What do you all think — is DEFT a smart entry point here or too much tied to crypto hype?",5,4,2025-10-18 23:43:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oab0cn/thoughts_on_deft_defi_technologies/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.024259,0.45,$T,0.6,[],['revenue'],0.6057142857142856
T,1nv69x4,ValueInvesting,Changes to the investment strategy as the interest rates decline,With the interest rate approaching 4.0% and especially once it falls below 4.0% I do not consider interest rates high anymore. Therefore I have to do adjustments to my current primary strategy described almost a year ago. The main idea of the original strategy was to keep most of the money in t-bills that reliably yield close to 5% and exploit the rest of the money as a tool to frequently buy and sell(cycle) dividend paying high quality stocks. The strategy allowed earning around 10% annually with almost no risk. As yields on cash fall below 4% this strategy loses its appeal and I have to do the adjustments. Before I explain the changes let me tell you one envious thought I had for many years… Take a look at 10yr treasury yield historic chart... Think of a guy in the 1980s who bought 10yr or especially 30yr treasury… The guy would enjoy 15% risk free return all the way until the 2010s… The world economy grew fast in the 1980s but the modern world doesn’t grow as fast mostly because of saturation and low human breeding rates. What if 5% return is equivalent to 15% in the 1980s given the low growth of the world? The first changes to the strategy came in May and were explained in my previous blog posts. I indeed significantly increased exposure to high quality US stocks leaving me exposed to higher risk but it also provided a better than expected returns during this period. As time goes by I now face the dilemma of still incredibly rich valuations of stocks and therefore high risks of drawdowns yet I cannot keep a significant portion of portfolio in t-bills as they provide unattractive returns. Therefore about a month ago I started the transition of t-bills based strategy to bond based strategy. I do not hold any t-bills anymore and now the money is either in stocks or bonds… This significantly increased my risk exposure but bonds will provide a much higher yield of around 6% while still being a relatively low risk instrument. The main reason why I think bonds are ok now is that I do not expect significantly higher inflation as the transition of the new administration tariffs as well as certain reduction in government expenses in certain areas show signs of fiscal responsibility and hopefully the inflation will be tamed. The stocks strategy also changed slightly. I do not cycle dividend stocks as much as I used to and keep stock ownership much longer as well as increased exposure to some high quality stocks with lower dividend yields. I continue to buy and sell the same stocks though. So some cycling is still happening but less of it. So here it is. This is what I am doing now for the next 3-6 months. Then we will review again.

T,1o37375,ValueInvesting,Thoughts on investing in Tokens,"I’ve been hearing a lot about tokens lately as a way to invest in private tech companies, so I thought I’d address the dangers of this approach here. Tokens are digital chips that pretend to follow a company’s share price on the blockchain. They are seen by many as a way to get access to private tech companies before they hit the market. It seems great on the surface due to the ability to have 24/7 trading, global reach and fractional ownership of great tech companies. But the reality is that I’ve heard that there are serious flaws to investing in tokens and I’d heavily advise against it. Anyone can create a token that claims to track a private company. That means there’s no real limit to how many tokens exist. The actual company (such as neuralink) tracked by the token might have 100 million real shares, while the token market could have billions of look-alikes. Those tokens don’t give you ownership, voting rights, or any legal claim on the company. It isn’t tied to real shares, so trading can look deep and active but vanish when size hits, making prices easy to game and rumors easy to exploit. This creates fake trading activity and the illusion of deep markets. Prices can move on hype or rumors, not on real business results. With no verified pricing or legal linkage, token prices can drift far from a company’s true value, fueling hype, misleading private-share pricing, and triggering cycles of pump-and-dump that damage the company’s perceived worth. There’s also a legal risk. Many of these stock-like tokens operate outside normal securities rules. Regulators have already taken action against some of them. The core issue: they blur the line between real ownership and imitation. Tl;DR: While tokens promise easy access, they often sacrifice trust and transparency. If not investing in the business, you're making a side bet on sentiment, with none of the rights of a true shareholder. Buyer Beware, IMHO.",1,2,2025-10-10 17:20:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o37375/thoughts_on_investing_in_tokens/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.053905,0.45,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6

T,1octyv8,stocks,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance. On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company. Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month. On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors. The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf. “Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.” Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested. Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.” The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal. Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated. Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade. Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same. “Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.” Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August. He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said. The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025. Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.” Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

T,1nxidln,stocks,Reddit (RDDT) - Everyone’s Missing What Actually Happened,"Position: Long 1 contract, Jan 2026 $210 Call (+$362.50) TL;DR: The 7% drop from “ChatGPT citations declining” is the most misunderstood selloff I’ve seen this year. Google just handed Reddit pricing power on a silver platter. ----- WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED: Sept 10: Google kills num=100 parameter → Search APIs can only pull 10-20 results instead of 100 → Reddit content (ranked 11-100) disappears from scraped data → ChatGPT citations drop from 14% to 2% → Stock tanks from $240 to $207 Wall Street sees: “Reddit losing AI relevance” I see: “Reddit just got monopoly pricing on their content” ----- THE SETUP EVERYONE’S MISSING: Before: OpenAI scraped Reddit for free via Google After: OpenAI must pay Reddit directly for API access This isn’t Reddit losing value. This is Google eliminating Reddit’s free rider problem. THE MATH: Current confirmed deals: - Google: $60M/year - OpenAI: ~$60M/year - Total AI licensing run rate: $200M+ They’re negotiating “dynamic pricing” = pay per use If usage drives pricing and free access just got killed, what happens to those numbers? Do the math. It’s not going down. ----- THE CITATION DROP ACTUALLY PROVES THE THESIS: Stock moved 14% on an 86% citation drop. Think about that. One metric from one AI platform moved a $30B company 14%. That’s not weakness. That’s dependency. ChatGPT can’t function without Reddit’s UGC. Neither can Perplexity. Neither can Google’s AI. They just lost free access. Now they pay, or their AI gets dumber. ----- WHY REDDIT WINS THIS: 1. Content moat nobody can replicate - 100M daily users having real conversations - Every niche topic covered - Continuously updated - 18 years of archived knowledge 1. Q2 fundamentals crushed it - $501M revenue (+84% YoY) - Just turned profitable - 97M DAU (+51% YoY) - Positive free cash flow 1. AI companies have no alternatives - Stack Overflow? Smaller, tech-only - Quora? Dead - Discord? Private, not indexed - Twitter? Toxic wasteland - Where else do you get quality UGC at scale? 1. Google just eliminated their competition - Can’t scrape Reddit via Google anymore - Must use Reddit’s direct API - Reddit sets the price ----- THE BEAR CASE (because I’m not an idiot): - Negotiations could fail - OpenAI might reduce Reddit dependency - Valuation still rich at 8x sales - User experience degrading from over-monetization - Competition could emerge These are real risks. I’m not ignoring them. But the risk/reward at $207 after a panic sell on misunderstood news? That’s the setup I want. ----- WHAT I’M WATCHING: Bullish catalysts: - New OpenAI deal announced (higher rates) - Q3 earnings showing AI revenue acceleration - Additional platform partnerships - Dynamic pricing implementation Bearish catalysts: - Failed negotiations - User growth slowdown - Continued citation decline without revenue growth - Management fumbling this opportunity ----- MY ACTUAL THESIS: The market saw “citations down” and panic sold. Smart money should see “free access eliminated, paid access mandatory.” Google didn’t hurt Reddit. Google just forced every AI company to negotiate directly with Reddit. And Reddit owns content nobody else has. That’s pricing power. The Jan 2026 $210 call gives me: - 3 months to see Q3 earnings - Time for new deal announcements - Exposure to re-rating if market figures this out - Limited downside (premium paid) This is 2% of my portfolio. High conviction on thesis, sized appropriately for execution risk. ----- What am I missing? Where’s the hole in this logic? Genuinely want to stress test this before adding to the position. Not financial advice. I own calls. Do your own research. But if you think I’m wrong, tell me why in the comments.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",810,250,2025-10-04 02:34:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nxidln/reddit_rddt_everyones_missing_what_actually/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.903474,0.4,$T,0.9,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'calls', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'profit']",1.0

T,1od2wys,wallstreetbets,🚛 Aurora Innovation (AUR): The Feds Just Fired the Starting Gun for Nationwide Driverless Trucking,"Position: 40,000 shares bought yesterday. My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore. Alright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom. On October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded ""patchwork"" of state-by-state regulations. Part 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead Aurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks. The catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22. This was a cornerstone of the bear case: * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.” * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.” * “True commercialization is a fantasy.” On Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd. But here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand. Full details here: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/carrier-safety/carrier-safety-resources/waiver-warning-device-requirements-effective-october Part 2: Aurora Didn’t Ask—They Fought and Won This wasn't a gift. They forced the government's hand. * Dec 2024: FMCSA denies Aurora’s initial request, citing a lack of specifics. Bears pop the champagne. * Jan 2025: Aurora sues the Department of Transportation, calling the denial “arbitrary and capricious” and arguing it ""stifles innovation"". * Oct 2025: FMCSA reverses course, works with Aurora, and grants a new, specific waiver that creates a clear, data-driven path forward. They proved that the federal government is no longer an immovable wall but a partner that can be compelled to find solutions for the autonomous age. Part 3: Why This Is the First Domino to Fall for Patchwork Regulation This is where you need to pay attention. This isn't just about triangles. This is a major strategic signal that the federal government is finally getting serious about creating a unified, national framework for autonomous vehicles. Here’s why this is bigger than it looks: * Precedent is Set: For the first time on a critical operational issue, the Feds have used their preemptive power to tell states to stand down. They have established the principle that where a federal, data-backed solution for AVs exists, it will be the law of the land. This is the first shot fired in the war against the patchwork nightmare. And Aurora is the perfect company for the Feds to partner with on this. They aren't some fly-by-night startup. They have deep, co-development partnerships with PACCAR (Peterbilt, Kenworth) and Volvo, who together command roughly 50% of the entire U.S. Class 8 truck market. When the government wants to create a national standard, they work with the 800-pound gorillas, not the monkeys. * A Federal Playbook is Emerging: The FMCSA's reversal shows a clear path forward. They denied a vague, industry-wide request but approved a specific, technically rigorous, and safety-focused solution. This creates a template for solving other human-centric rules. The message is clear: bring us the data, and we will modernize the rules. * Executive Action Aligns with Legislative Intent: This waiver perfectly complements the ""America Drives Act,"" a federal bill currently being pushed that would create a unified nationwide framework for AVs. That bill’s goal is to explicitly preempt state laws that would prohibit driverless trucks based on the absence of a human driver. The FMCSA's action is a down payment on that goal. The executive branch is laying the groundwork and signaling its support while Congress works to make it permanent. The entire federal apparatus is starting to move in the same direction. The bear case has always been that America’s fragmented regulatory system would strangle AV trucking in its crib. This waiver is the strongest evidence yet that the federal government recognizes that risk and is now actively working to mitigate it, creating a clear path for interstate commerce. Part 4: Why the Stock Still Looks Stuck So why isn’t the stock ripping? One word: Uber and its 🤡 financing deal. Back in May, Uber raised $1.15B in exchangeable notes tied to its Aurora stake. Hedge funds bought them, then shorted AUR to hedge. Short interest exploded from ~89M shares in April to >130M by May. This isn’t “hedgies betting against Aurora.” It’s just 🤡 math. But the effect is the same: constant, price-insensitive selling pressure, driving down the stock anytime it nears around $8.50. So we’ve got: * Fundamentals pointing to the moon → A landmark regulatory win that signals the beginning of the end for the patchwork problem. * Market mechanics pressing down → convert-arb shorts keeping the price stuck. That’s why the stock looks flat even though the entire long-term thesis just got massively de-risked. Part 5: The Bull Case - Why Aurora Owns the Road Ahead So with the biggest regulatory threat neutralized, let's talk about why Aurora is set to dominate the now-open field. * The OEM Moat: Aurora’s strategy is a fortress. Their partnerships with PACCAR and Volvo aren’t just logos on a slide; they are deep, multi-year integrations to build autonomous-ready trucks from the factory floor up. A competitor can't just copy this. This creates a massive barrier to entry and a direct sales channel to half the industry. * The Competition is Dead: While Aurora was building this moat, the competition was self-destructing. TuSimple? Imploded in a storm of SEC investigations and shady dealings with China, delisted from NASDAQ, and is now pivoting to AI gaming tech. Embark? Ran out of money and shut down. Waymo? Alphabet's golden child deprioritized its trucking division to focus on robotaxis in cities and in the process is helping normalize vehicle autonomy to the public. And Kodiak, while alive, is a small private player with a fraction of Aurora’s miles, partners, and capital. They’re not a serious threat at national scale. Aurora is effectively the last scaled U.S. player standing. The field has been cleared and the reality of autonomous vehicles is rapidly being normalized. * The Tech Edge: Aurora’s 'Driver' is built around its proprietary FirstLight LiDAR, which has a range of over 450 meters—critical for stopping a fully-loaded 80,000-pound rig at highway speeds. This isn't just about staying in the lane; it's about superhuman perception that underpins their entire safety case. * The Multi-Billion Dollar Prize: So what’s the payoff? The realistic, serviceable market for long-haul autonomous trucking is estimated to be $44.5 billion annually by 2035. In the bull case, Aurora, with its OEM moat and cleared competitive field, could plausibly capture 25-50% of that. Let's run the numbers for you apes: a 25% share is over $11 billion in high-margin, recurring revenue. Slap a conservative 10x sales multiple on that (standard for a 'Driver as a Service' model), and you’re looking at a $111 billion market cap. From today’s $9.45 billion, that’s a 10-bagger, and that's not even the most optimistic scenario. Conclusion: The Road Is Being Cleared Aurora still has hurdles—scaling production with its OEM partners and proving the economics—but the single greatest strategic threat, a federal government unwilling to solve the state patchwork problem, is dissolving. The fundamental bull case just got a massive injection of rocket fuel, but the price is still on the launchpad thanks to the short-sellers. And you know what that means for this rocket. This isn’t financial advice (except for my wife's boyfriend). But if you’re looking for an asymmetric setup, this is it: the government is clearing the road, the competition has crashed and burned, and Aurora is leading the convoy with half the entire trucking industry riding shotgun. Strap yourself in and come along for the ride. 🚀",95,87,2025-10-22 08:46:01,https://i.redd.it/s95r0xm5mmwf1.jpeg,2025-10-23 09:06:38.672823,0.4,$T,1.0,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'shorts', 'moon', 'rocket', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue']",0.9457142857142856
T,1ocatkw,ValueInvesting,The Dip of the Dip of the Dip for NVO,"You don’t see pullbacks like this very often, let alone from a company that has quietly dominated its space for over a century like NVO. If you already have a balanced, diversified portfolio, adding a small % here feels like a gift. The market keeps hammering it down, and sentiment has flipped so hard that people are forgetting that the they are a global leader with monstrous cash flow, pricing power, and unmatched brand strength. If you’re sitting on red and can’t stomach another average down (or “buy the dip of the dip of the dip” as it’s starting to feel), I completely get it. BUT, if you’re looking for quality, long-term growth, and actual durability, then do not go skipping over NVO right now just because the chart looks ugly. This company has been the backbone of diabetes care for decades, and now it’s expanding into obesity, cardiometabolic, and next-gen therapies...including their upcoming oral GLP-1 pills. Their smaller R&D bets could turn into legitimate moonshots. On a cash flow basis, it’s trading at a discount to plenty of companies that don’t even come close in terms of stability or dominance. Time and time again, people bail during these drawdowns, and time and time again, the strong names recover. Unless you think the global demand for diabetes and obesity care is about to vanish overnight, this selloff looks more like a setup than a warning. These dips are what we live for!!! Historically, here is when you get paid for having conviction. Not calling for a rocket back to ATHs tomorrow, but 135–150 looks like a very fair range once sentiment normalizes. Would love to hear from those who think this keeps sliding, what’s the real bear case beyond “it’s been going down”?",132,117,2025-10-21 11:51:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ocatkw/the_dip_of_the_dip_of_the_dip_for_nvo/,2025-10-23 09:08:11.997720,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['bear', 'moon', 'rocket', 'dip', 'eps']",0.9285714285714285
T,1nom5ay,ValueInvesting,JP Morgan buy thesis on ASML,"From JP Morgan: ""TSMC has started to ramp up its 2nm process and this process ramp will continue in ’26 when their lead customer, Apple, is likely to start using this process. There have also been press reports yesterday that Nvidia is expected to be the first to adopt the upcoming A16 process at TMSC which will implement backside power. If these reports are true, then TSMC would need to ramp up significant capacity for A16 in ’27 (when it is likely to be in production). A16 will need 1 or 2 more EUV exposures than 2nm and thus will be particularly positive for ASML because of the increase in lithography intensity but more importantly because of the volume of wafer capacity that would need to be added if Nvidia were to start using the leading edge process (Nvidia has been using a process that is 1 or 2 generations behind the leading edge on its leading edge processors till now). TSMC would need to start preparing for Nvidia ramp in terms of orders and building capacity in 2H26 which would result in stronger orders/sales for ASML from TSMC in both ’26 but definitely in ’27. HBM-related demand remains robust and memory pricing has not shown weakness. Indications have been that Samsung is possibly closer to qualification for HBM4 at Nvidia as well, which would be very positive for equipment shipments starting end of ’26 into ’27. Thus, risks that ASML guides to a weak ’26 are becoming much less likely in our opinion and ’27 trends will be strong (though not guided so soon by ASML). Importantly for the stock, once ASML guides to ’26 revenue range on October 15th, only ’27 will matter and though ASML will not guide to it, the market will speculate on positive trends and that should help the stock. ASML also continues to trade below prior average multiple of 30-35x and thus appears attractive. We reiterate that ASML remains our top pick in ‘25."" Positive sell side reports have been a major catalyst for ASML over the last month. Coverage of ASML had become widely negative throughout '25. There are two bear theses which are related. The first is that litho intensity has peaked in terms of capex requirements to move to the next nodes. The second thesis is that high-NA won’t be adopted for a while as it is not economic. While TSMC didn’t introduce scaling at the N2 node as they moved to the new GAA transistor architecture (nanosheets), we should see scaling at the next one or even two nodes again—which will be a positive for ASML. On the second bear thesis, the positive is that high-NA is much more economic than EUV at its early introduction, as EUV’s uptime and productivity were extremely low. The technology had all sorts of problems and there were continuously bear theses flying around that the technology will never make it. The positive for ASML though is that even if high-NA gets delayed, more multiple patterning with EUV tools will be needed at the most advanced processing steps, which actually increases revenues and margins for ASML (high-NA is lower margin than EUV due to current low capacity levels). So, the long term bull case for ASML is that: 1. TSMC at its next one or two nodes will start scaling again, leading to increased EUV demand as more EUV process steps will be needed again. 2. TSMC is building out three fab clusters—one in the US and two in Taiwan, where capacity requirements are increasing due to the boom in AI demand. 3. DRAM is becoming more EUV intensive, due to the scaling roadmap. AI is very DRAM intensive (HBM), boosting needed fab capacity. 4. ASML has zero competition. I'd add some charts here with further details but apparently Reddit doesn't allow this - anyways, more background on the current outlook in AI can be found here, which is an important driver for future ASML tool orders: [https://www.techinvestments.io/p/the-token-explosion](https://www.techinvestments.io/p/the-token-explosion)",44,10,2025-09-23 16:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nom5ay/jp_morgan_buy_thesis_on_asml/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.307989,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'volume', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.9285714285714285
T,1o6qwae,stocks,American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) quietly building a U.S. lithium recycling powerhouse,"Hey everyone, I’ve been digging into American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) lately, and I think this one deserves way more attention than it’s getting. With the renewed U.S. China tariff tensions, Washington is pushing hard to rebuild domestic control over critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 80% of global lithium refining happens in China. That’s a huge strategic vulnerability for the U.S. and Europe. Tariffs and supply disruptions have reminded everyone that if you can’t refine it yourself, you’re at someone else’s mercy so it seems. That’s exactly where ABAT fits in in my opinion. They’re an American company building American lithium capacity, supported by U.S. grants and policy. Their work directly aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act’s push for U.S. sourced battery materials, and that could mean long-term funding, tax incentives, and federal partnerships. With the current tariff issue with China, its helping ABAT’s positioning, pushing investment and attention toward homegrown battery material companies. They’re basically trying to close the full loop of the U.S. battery supply chain from recycling spent batteries, to extracting lithium from domestic resources to refining battery-grade materials. In a world that’s moving fast toward EVs and energy storage, that’s a pretty unique position. * Revenues are actually starting to ramp Q4 FY25 revenue up over 180% QoQ, showing their recycling operations are gaining traction. * Operating costs down 30% YoY, meaning they’re tightening efficiency while scaling. * Strong U.S. government support, multiple DOE grants + a $900M Letter of Interest from U.S. EXIM Bank for their Tonopah Flats lithium project. * Added to the Russell 2000 index, which brings more institutional visibility. ABAT is building infrastructure that America actually needs if it wants to compete in lithium and battery materials. Their focus on sustainable recycling + domestic lithium refining could put them in a sweet spot as demand skyrockets and the U.S. pushes for local supply chains. They’ve been through the cash burn and early stage pain already, but management seems to be getting costs under control and executing better lately. They’re not profitable yet and still rely on external funding - but for a small-cap with government backing, real assets, and visible progress, it feels like the risk/reward looks promising given the above in my opinion. If they can get Tonopah Flats into production and keep growing recycling throughput, this could evolve from a microcap story to a serious U.S. battery materials player over the next few years in my opinion. Curious if anyone else is following ABAT or has thoughts on their Tonopah project? I’m long, holding. Would love to hear other DD or perspectives from people in the battery/materials space. Not financial advice and always do your own reasearch / DD.

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America. -Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate. -Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB. -Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”. -Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. -Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger. What I don’t like: -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. -Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing. -Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business. -User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S. What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate: They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers. Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t. Evan is a young billionaire married to a supermodel and living in California.

T,1oawxqp,stocks,"Fundamentals Don’t Matter in Predicting Bubble Pop, Sentiment and Liquidity Do","I keep seeing people go on and on about how the AI bubble is going to burst soon because the fundamentals are so stupid and it echoes so many elements of past popped bubbles. I think the mistake her is that it assumes a rational investor who gives a fuck about if the underlying company behind the stock makes sense. I personally feel the average investor retail or investor is just a dummy who invests based on what they think other people believe other people believe and how much easy stock-buying money that have access to at any given time. Only two things I think matter now. One is Sentiment (and not even what an investor believes but what that investor believes other investors believe other investors believe. So even if a person thinks a company’s stock is stupid and overvalued, if they believe other people believe other people buy into the stock, they’ll do it too especially when FOMO and YOLO are high. Two is liquidity: how much money do people have lying around to throw at half-baked dice rolls without having to liquidate another stock first? As long as people or institutions have disposable income in this climate of extra-stupid divorced from reality people they will just keep dip buying and riding out lows. A lot of popular sentiment, number one, flows from liquidity, number two. One people start running out of money and their personal finances are a mess and they need help to pay their bills and can’t just buy new stocks without liquidating old stocks and worse their old stocks are too in the toilet to even liquidate, then the sentiment will go into the toilet as they can’t just FOMO and YOLO and dip buy and ride out price drops at will anymore. Then and only then will fundamentals and bad news and earnings skepticism and giving a fuck about if company’s business model or stock price makes any sense. Comparing to past cycles doesn’t mean anything because people weren’t as routinely delusional as now. In 2008 insane multiples of valuation based strictly on growth was still a novel concept that wasn’t fully normalized and bought into. It still had a lot of skepticism. Investors were easier to scare. Now it’s way too routine to ignore traditional metrics in favor of arbitrary vanity metrics and good growth fairy tale stories and buzz. I think as long as people can keep finding money to buy more stocks and a lot of people stay once in a lifetime levels of stupid talking about fundamentals won’t matter. I think if a bubble pop happens it’s more likely to happen off some weird black swan event than a rise in common sense and sound financial analysis. As long as everyone else is buying stocks and driving stock prices up and people have money lying around to follow suit, they will just keep rationalizing away all the bad fundamentals and ridiculous unrealistic promises in the world. The only reason the circular accounting in AI story is even gaining traction isn’t because any of this is new (youtubers like Nobody Special Finance and various Twitter uses were pointing it out for years and were called permanent cranks); it’s because people and institutions are getting broker and more economically precarious and scared and uncertain and now are willing to entertain the theory despite dismissing it the past few years when they were economically secure enough to not care.",110,58,2025-10-19 18:21:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oawxqp/fundamentals_dont_matter_in_predicting_bubble_pop/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.857893,0.4,$T,0.9,[],"['earnings', 'yolo', 'dip']",0.917142857142857

T,1o5nghn,financialindependence,Unexpected Gift / FIRE Questions,"Long time listener, first time caller. I’ve been on some sort of FIRE path for the past 11 or so years, since leaving graduate school. I (39M) am married with two kids, and until about 18 months ago lived in a VHCOL area; I’m now working mostly remotely in a MCOL area, and although we miss many specific things about city living, life is overall better and calmer and more manageable now living in a smaller town. To date, I’ve not been someone who has made / consistently updates FIRE models, although I do play around with that type of analysis occasionally. Generally, we’re sort of boring and average on the FIRE spectrum. Some facts before I get to the meat of the post: \-I gross about $120K per year and my wife has historically made about the same salary as me, but is now venturing out on her own as a freelancer; let’s call household income $200K currently, and about $250K in the last few years. \-Our non-real estate net worth is just about $1M ($950K as of this past week). $50K HYSA, $100K brokerage/post-tax, and $800K across IRAs and 401ks (about $500K traditional and $300K ROTH). Effectively all of the investments are in VTSAX. \-As may be obvious when looking at the net worth breakdown, the past 10 years we have focused on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for both my wife and I, with relatively little left over for post-tax investments. Daycare costs in a VHCOL killed us for a year or two, but with one kid in public school now and being in a generally lower-cost area, we’ve been able to do a little more post-tax investment recently. \-We were lucky and got a low interest rate mortgage - 2.9% - in 2021 on a little condo in our VHCOL area, and we lived there until recently. We are now renting this apartment out, and the rent proceeds cover our mortgage/interest, property tax, HOA, and a general upkeep fund, with no “profit.” We have $500K left on the mortgage, and the theoretical market value is around 800K. \-Our plan to date has been to be work-optional around age 50, and we seem to be on a decent path for that, provided we shift our investment activity in the coming decade from 401k maxing to post-tax. We both like our lines of work, and we obviously are not grinding soul-crushing jobs for correspondingly high pay. But neither of us want to be trading our time for money, and the sooner neither of us have to do that - particularly my wife - the better. We don’t want to be “retired” so much as unencumbered. There are about a million things we’d like to make and projects we’d like to do and places we’d like to see without having to worry about the expectation of those things creating money for us (or stopping us from creating money). If they do, great; if not, we’d love the luxury of that not being a problem. We’ve also both experienced unexpected losses of dear friends that have really clarified the preciousness of time. We’d like to be as present for our kids as possible as they grow up (and being in a smaller town / lower cost area has already helped with that). But, here is the rub - when we moved to the MCOL area, my wife’s parents offered to buy the new house outright and effectively structure a lower interest mortgage for us; we could get a conventional mortgage in the future when rates came down. We didn’t realize they even had the ability to do this, but they had themselves recently received a large inheritance from my wife’s grandmother. Then, six months ago, they told us that the loan was absolved, and that we should consider the house as part of my wife’s inheritance. They told us they wanted to put their inheritance, and their own excess savings, to use for my wife and her sisters while everyone was still alive and healthy rather than bequeathing it all upon their deaths. It was a lovely and completely unexpected gesture, and frankly both my wife and I still don’t really know how to contextualize this gift alongside our previous 10 years of fairly determined grinding in a very expensive area of the country. We also probably wouldn't have accepted if they had initially offered to simply buy the house for us with no expectation of repayment, and I think they knew that! So, after all the preamble, the question is - how does a gift like this change the FIRE math? The very concept of FIRE? We had assumed we would be paying some kind of a mortgage on a timeline that would roughly align with our financial independence; perhaps until our mid-50s. Now, suddenly, we have a paid off house. We had been pretty locked in on our +/- age 50 path and the mindset that went along with it; now it seems feasible for, say, one of us to stop working for a salary much earlier if we so desire. Or for one of us to take a sabbatical, so to speak, and not worry about maximum investing for a year. Put in the simplest terms, our net worth went from about $1.2M to about $1.7M with the stroke of a pen, but that additional net worth is simultaneously illiquid, eliminates the biggest single expense on our balance sheet, and provides a very deep sense of security that I hadn’t really known before. This gift is also very humbling, and has both of us thinking about gratitude. Put another way, yes, we can now just shift the mortgage payment directly into post-tax investments. That’s a simple way to conceptualize the change, and it’s basically what we’ve been doing in 2025. But is that the best use of this gift? Has anyone here ever been in a situation similar to this type of windfall, and if so, did it / how did it alter your thinking? This post seems to have turned out to be a weird mix of some but not all useful numbers and philosophical questions, so happy to provide any specific info if that’s helpful.

Mostly from fed and corporate layoffs and tariffs is looking to create a ""perfect storm"" that bodes well for eBay, this is a play on earnings this coming wednesday. There's a bonus - this Friday will be the first missing paycheck for furloughed federal workers - and lots of them are living paycheck to paycheck already. So this weekend might add a small bump to the already growing earnings for a nice surprise. catalyst for buyers: more job insecurity/instability (furloughs, layoffs, etc) and inflation on new items from tariffs means smaller family budgets. people are going to start (and already are) hunting for deals. aka more demand for cheaper, second hand shit. catalyst for sellers: same shit is going to push people to start supplementing thier income.

T,1npm4f4,investing,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom. The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026. You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks. The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running. I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",18,9,2025-09-24 19:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.329454,0.4,$T,0.8,[],"['revenue', 'eps']",0.8114285714285714
T,1ocxlwm,ValueInvesting,OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas Browser Takes Direct Aim at Google Chrome ($GOOG),"OpenAI just made its biggest product move since ChatGPT: the launch of ChatGPT Atlas, a new AI-powered web browser that blends generative AI directly into search and navigation.

Alphabet shares fell nearly 5% intraday, wiping billions off its market cap, as investors digested what an AI-native browser could mean for Google’s core ad business.

T,1o334r8,ValueInvesting,I’m getting mixed signals,"I go on CNBC and see all these talking heads talk about a bubble, and how it’s related to the 1990s, and I think there is more room to run. However another one of my top indicators is retail buying into the market like a bunch of retards. Inflows have gone from 5 billion back in summer to 7 billion a week now. A 40% increase. When I look at fundamentals for the AI trade, truly all that matters is that Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and the hyperscalers don’t slowdown their spending. From how it sounds with this AMD/Open AI deal we are not getting that slowdown anytime soon, in fact they need even more compute than they thought. Now when I look at forward valuations on the S&P 500 it sits at 23 times is forward price to earnings, and on the Nasdaq its 27 times forward earnings. Price to sales for the S&P 500 is 3.39, and for the Nasdaq its 6.32. Now yes these valuations are rich on a historical basis, but if AI makes these companies efficiently go up they can increase revenue and margins, and that’s the big question nobody can answer right now. If these companies can grow and expand their revenues and margins in the next few years we are not in a bubble and valuations are justified, if it takes 10 years to implement AI like it did the internet we could be flat for some time. The reason I say flat is because everyone has already learned their lesson from the dotcom crash and I don’t believe we will ever see anything like it again in the stock market.",48,70,2025-10-10 14:55:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o334r8/im_getting_mixed_signals/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.054495,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'revenue']",0.8114285714285714

T,1o676w7,stocks,$LAES - SEALSQ’s validation cycle with Landis+Gyr,"The Landis+Gyr × SEALSQ partnership news directly reinforces & extends my earlier thesis about SEALSQ’s positioning in the quantum-secure hardware narrative & it gives the argument a new real-world validation anchor. Here’s how: SEALSQ is already positioned at the rare, tangible end of the quantum spectrum: actually producing secure chips while others float on hype. The Landis+Gyr announcement functions as empirical verification. SEALSQ’s hardware isn’t theoretical; it’s being integrated at scale into utility infrastructure, beyond R&D slides. Landis+Gyr explicitly cites SEALSQ’s quantum-resistant chips & PKI services, an admission that quantum-safe hardware has moved from a speculative virtue signal to regulatory & commercial requirement. In short, the ‘regulatory’ momentum I flagged (NIST, ENISA, CISA) is materializing through OEM pipelines, translating policy inevitability into partnerships. SEALSQ is building tangible chips. Now, endorsed by a heavyweight in grid technology. Landis+Gyr isn’t some boutique pilot partner; it’s embedded in utility infrastructure across North America. Their CSO’s statement makes it explicit. Quantum-safe integration isn’t a demo, it’s a policy horizon for critical systems. This shifts SEALSQ’s profile entirely: from a microcap with a clever narrative to a strategic supplier embedded in regulated infrastructure. My earlier post correctly positioned SEALSQ as a beneficiary of the compliance wave driven by NIST, CISA, etc. The Landis+Gyr partnership now closes that loop. A validation cycle: Regulated utilities begin integrating SEALSQ hardware → Compliance agencies spotlight the early adopters → Analysts recalibrate their models around ‘quantum-resilient infrastructure’ → SEALSQ harvests momentum from both regulatory mandate & procurement inertia. In effect, this deal converts narrative into traction. It anchors the speculative premium to something the market can finally price in. From a trade & valuation standpoint, the deal reinforces my argument that SEALSQ’s modest speculative multiple is positioned for re-rating as capital migrates from theoretical quantum narratives to deployable post-quantum security. It also provides rational justification for long OTM calls into December.",15,3,2025-10-14 05:35:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o676w7/laes_sealsqs_validation_cycle_with_landisgyr/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.879340,0.4,$T,0.9,['LAES'],['calls'],0.8057142857142856
T,1o3ewij,stocks,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned. Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC. The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting. Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab. Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment. Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation. Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera. Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said. Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees. Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines. Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps. While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users. Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

T,1nqlo50,investing,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you. 1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data. 2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance. 3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights. Why the turnaround is likely to happen now: - Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price. Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move. Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move. - Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently. - I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts. Risks: - „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing. - „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow. - „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable.

T,1obu1a7,ValueInvesting,[Hidden Compounders] G. Willi-Food ($WILC) - Fairly Valued Small Cap with Strong Compounding Potential,"Further on my quest to find hidden compounders, I’ve been looking into G. Willi-Food International ($WILC), an Israeli food distributor that’s quietly delivering consistent growth and profitability. It’s a simple, cash-generative business that looks fairly valued with upside potential if management executes well. **Quick business overview**: WILC markets and distributes food products like canned goods, dairy substitutes, and oils under its own brands and private labels. It operates mainly in Israel but also exports internationally. With a market cap around $200M to 300M, it’s largely ignored by analysts but I think it serves a stable, recurring-demand sector (food staples). Recent results have been strong: record revenue and profit in 2024, growing margins, and consistent dividends. Operating Margins and ROIC both in the 10% range. It’s not flashy, but it’s a durable business with a long operating history and solid fundamentals. **Valuation**: I think it's slightly undervalued to fairly valued. P/E ratio of 9 and P/S ratio of 1.5 are in-line with what you'd expect for a consumer staples business. Balance sheet is healthy, margins are improving, with consistent cash generation and a history of prudent capital management. Revenue is growing and positive operating leverage means even modest top-line growth can lift EPS faster. Plus, its small size leaves room for organic and M&A-driven expansion. **Risks**: WILC faces some notable risks typical of a small international distributor. Being based in Israel exposes it to geopolitical and currency fluctuations that can affect operations and margins. Competition in the food distribution space is intense, and its small scale could limit pricing power or growth if expansion proves costly. Finally, the stock’s low liquidity and modest valuation could make it a potential value trap if margin improvements stall. **Bottom Line**: WILC strikes me as a straightforward, resilient business with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and steadily improving margins. It’s largely ignored by the market due to its small size and international base, but that under the radar status may offer a genuine margin of safety. The company doesn’t need explosive growth to create value... just continued operational discipline and moderate earnings expansion could justify a higher multiple. It’s a simple, cash-generative staples business trading at a fair price with asymmetric upside if performance remains consistent. What are this sub's thoughts? Happy to expound my argument a bit more with numbers, valuation projections, but wanted to kick things off on a qualitative manner first.",5,1,2025-10-20 21:14:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1obu1a7/hidden_compounders_g_willifood_wilc_fairly_valued/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.000897,0.4,$T,0.6,['WILC'],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.7342857142857142
T,1o1rlmr,ValueInvesting,PayPal DD lots of potential,"PayPal is a mature company that’s been trying to reinvent itself over the past two years. Most people still see it as just a checkout button, but what’s really happening inside the business is a slow rebuild around higher-margin opportunities. Right now PayPal processes roughly $1.7 trillion in total payment volume per year. About a quarter of that comes from cross-border transactions, and that part of the business alone generates around $12 to $13 billion in revenue with about $3.5 billion in profit. It’s by far their most profitable segment, but the U.S. domestic side is still their foundation, bringing in more than half of all revenue. Domestically PayPal’s share has slipped a bit as Apple Pay and Shopify Payments expand, yet their branded checkout volume is still growing in the mid-single digits and their newer checkout platform has already captured about 60 percent of U.S. transactions. If that trend continues and they stabilize their U.S. share, PayPal could see domestic transaction profit rise from around $3 billion today to closer to $4 billion by 2027. That would keep the U.S. market steady enough for new areas like advertising, merchant services, and PayPal World to drive the real growth. The advertising business could quietly become one of their biggest profit engines. They plan to use the data from hundreds of billions of transactions each year to create a retail media platform that connects merchants with shoppers. Because PayPal already knows what people buy and where, they can offer advertisers precise targeting without relying on third-party cookies or outside data. Even if this business only captures one percent of the total digital ad market, that would mean roughly $2 to $3 billion a year in high-margin revenue by 2028. At a 30 percent operating margin, that’s nearly a billion dollars in new profit, which is massive for a company whose core payments margins are tighter. Their new merchant platform, PayPal Open, could also meaningfully expand profit per customer. Instead of just charging processing fees, PayPal will provide risk tools, analytics, and integrated business finance. If even 10 percent of their current merchants adopt these value-added services and spend an extra $100 per month on them, that’s roughly $1.2 billion in recurring annual revenue with higher margins than payment volume. Layer that with gradual growth in debit card usage and Pay Later financing, and PayPal could realistically add another $2 to $3 billion in net income from these extensions within the next five years. The long-term wildcard is PayPal World. The CEO believes it could connect over two billion new wallet users across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. If that happens, cross-border payment volume could climb from $400 billion today to as much as $1.2 trillion by 2030. Even with some fee compression to about 2.5 percent, that would push revenue from roughly $12 billion today to over $30 billion, with profits potentially doubling to $7 or $8 billion annually. That kind of expansion could lift PayPal’s total earnings from around $6 billion today to roughly $11–12 billion within the decade, depending on execution and global adoption. Assuming they maintain capital discipline and keep buybacks running at current levels, earnings per share could move from about $4.70 today to somewhere between $9 and $11 by 2030. Using a conservative multiple of 16 times earnings puts the stock around $150, while a bullish case assuming successful adoption of PayPal World and growth from ads could push fair value closer to $200–220 per share. In short PayPal isn’t a hyper-growth tech name anymore, but it’s quietly repositioning itself to capture high-margin opportunities in advertising, merchant tools, and global interoperability. The next few years will show whether management can convert those opportunities into sustained earnings growth. If they execute, PayPal could end up generating more profit from data, services, and cross-border payments than it ever did from simple online checkout.",3,9,2025-10-09 00:10:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o1rlmr/paypal_dd_lots_of_potential/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.249821,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'puts', 'earnings', 'volume', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7342857142857142
T,1nzhgzf,investing,Why I still think gold is one of the smartest investments right now!,"I’ve been watching gold closely for the last few months and honestly the current rally in XAUUSD doesn’t surprise me much. It’s been building momentum since early this year, and now that it’s hitting new highs people suddenly started paying attention again. But what’s crazy is that this move still doesn’t look like it’s done yet. A lot of traders think gold moves just because of inflation but that’s not really the main driver right now. What’s actually pushing it higher is a mix of central bank buying, weaker confidence in global currencies, and the idea that yields might have already peaked. You can see it in how gold keeps holding strong even when the dollar stays firm. That usually doesn’t happen unless there’s serious underlying demand. Every time gold makes a new high, people start saying it’s overvalued or due for a correction, but history keeps proving otherwise. When you zoom out, big breakouts like this often mark the start of a longer bullish cycle, not the end. I saw something similar in 2011 and again in 2020, both times it went much further than most expected. I’m not saying it’s going straight up from here, markets never work that way, but personally I think the upside potential still looks strong. If you believe in long term wealth protection or just want something that moves independently from equities, this might be one of the better times to start building exposure. Would like to hear what others here think, are you buying this breakout or waiting for a dip?

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning. The main stocks I’m considering are: • AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side. • UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news. • SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound. I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO. I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

T,1o3p120,stocks,Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti,"$LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security & IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \~1,500× & 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power & a Wix website. SEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness & a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, & branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” & “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 & reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products & the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month & carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards & a rotation of partnerships & acquisitions. When the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence. Quantum computing demands a level of obsessive attention to detail: fractions of a Kelvin, picosecond timing, noise isolation at the edge of physics. When the front end looks half-finished, it’s hard not to question whether that discipline extends behind the lab door. Something doesn’t add up. Have you seen SEALSQ’s website? If corporate websites are any proxy for DNA, SEALSQ looks like it’s building things that actually work. Expect a fresh wave of press releases & conveniently timed analyst upgrades in the near term. The Quantum + AI Conference: alternately marketed as Quantum + AI 2.0 or IQT Quantum + AI, depending on who’s paying for the banner, will occur October 19–21, 2025, in New York City. The agenda promises deep inquiry into the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, & cryptographic security.

One thing might be behind the fall – a post from a billionaire. * Tesla boss Elon Musk echoed boycott calls, writing on X: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” targeting the pro-transgender messaging of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park. * The selloff may not be directly linked to his comments – stocks don’t usually move on culture-war tweets alone – but markets aren’t exactly immune to Musk’s megaphone either. **Boycott Fears or Just Noise?** * Investors might be quietly wondering whether this morphs into something bigger.After all, Netflix is no stranger to political or cultural backlash – though historically, it shrugs these off. * Streaming is sticky. Cancel campaigns have rarely translated into a sustained drop in subscribers, especially given Netflix’s scale and diversified content library. * Still, even the perception of reputational risk can move a stock in the short term, particularly when traders are hunting for reasons in an otherwise bullish tape. **Bigger Picture Still Strong** * Context: Netflix shares are up 32% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 14% gain, proving investors see the platform as resilient in choppy macro conditions. * Growth levers like ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, and global expansion continue to fuel optimism, even if one-off controversies grab headlines. * Musk’s post may not ding the fundamentals, but it added a twist to a day when Netflix underperformed while the rest of Big Tech marched higher.",0,6,2025-10-03 10:39:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvl68/nflx_netflix_stock_sheds_24_was_it_because_of/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.488610,0.4,$T,0.8,[],"['bull', 'calls', 'support']",0.7171428571428571

T,1o8v6mm,investing,Consistently Profitable Traders - Is a 3-5% Monthly Return Realistic with a $100k+ Prop Account?,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for real-world insights from those with years of experience, especially those who have maintained profitability and consistency, not just enjoyed a few good months. I’ve been in the market since 2020, focusing mainly on long-term crypto holds and swing trading. Recently, I’ve shifted my attention entirely to prop firm trading. I spent three months on a demo account with decent results trading XAU/USD (Gold) and EUR/USD. I know that demo results mean nothing when real money is at stake, so I’m now focused on testing and improving my strategies. My main question is this: Is a consistent 3-5% monthly return (36-60% annually) a realistic target for a trader with a well-funded account ($100k+)? Assuming you have strong risk management and a proven advantage, is this target too ambitious? I’d love to know what your realistic and consistent monthly or annual percentage target is, and what maximum daily or weekly drawdown you typically allow to achieve it. I’ve been working on a trading bot. It was initially designed for crypto and performs well in backtests for BTC, ETH, and SOL. Now, I’m putting in a lot of effort to adapt it for Gold, high-liquidity Forex pairs, and major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The challenge is that my four-year backtests for Forex and Metals aren’t showing the same consistent success I see in crypto. For instance, my current XAU/USD strategy has only a 34% win rate, and I’m trying hard to raise that to at least 55-60%. The optimization process is frustrating. I’ve either overloaded the bot with too many indicators, making it stop finding trades, or it’s too loose and generates many false signals. I’m looking for that perfect balance. I’m also integrating modules to track fundamental news, the FOMC calendar, and the DXY direction as key inputs for trade direction confirmation, aiming for a more complete approach. I’ve heard that a Grid Scalp strategy (multiple open positions spaced by a few pips) can work well on Gold, but my bot’s test results aren’t optimized yet. Do any consistently profitable traders here use a Grid Scalp strategy for XAU/USD? If so, any advice or important warnings would be greatly appreciated. What main strategies (scalping, mean reversion, trend following, etc.) do you use for Metals, Forex, and Indices? And importantly, what is your typical lot size when managing a $100k+ account while keeping strict risk limits (e.g., 0.5% or 1% risk per trade)? Finally, I’ve narrowed my choices down to GoatFundedTrader, FTMO, and FundedNext while researching spreads, fees, and rules. Any insights, reviews, or warnings about these or other top firms would be incredibly helpful. Any advice or constructive feedback is welcome.

T,1ockh3m,ValueInvesting,Value Companies Perceived as Value Traps,"A few great businesses today, were seen as failures, or “value traps” at one point. I believe it is valuable to reflect on these, to help identify value today. Microsoft (early 2010s) Seen as a slow moving tech giant. Missed out on phones completely. People were comparing it to Apple at the time and it seemed to be lacking in innovation in comparison. Compared to Amazon, it was late to cloud computing. It traded at a low P/E for years. It was seen as an ex-growth company. Buying it was like buying Coca-Cola or something. I see comparisons between how this company is viewed and how some people are viewing Amazon and Nvidia “How Big Can It Get?? The whole stock market is worth _____, it could never hit a ______ market cap!” Even when Amazon and Nvidia still have a lot of growth to go. But, Apple is probably the most “stagnant” company that can be compared to how Microsoft was being viewed. Apple is being viewed in a similar way for being behind on AI, but Apple will prevail! Is Apple value? On paper, probably not, though. Apple (1990s/early 2000s) Products were failing, their computers were irrelevant, and their OS business model wasn’t understood. It was seen as a dying company. What company does this remind me of, perhaps Intel, or PayPal? Is it game over for these companies? Maybe, but they’re making some moves that may pay off and they could have a turn around story like these other “value traps”. American Express (1960s) Was defrauded by a vegetable oil company. People panicked. Someone in particular bought. This was a big deal. This is like if a rocket explodes / fails for RKLB, or if a Taiwan invasion happens for many Chinese stocks such as JD, or BABA. These are big events - but if the company is truly quality, when an event send its stock price far below fair value, this is a great time to feast on some good prices. Now, the question is. Since you won’t buy Chinese stocks because of the Taiwan invasion possibility, will you buy Chinese stocks after an invasions happens? Will you buy RKLB if their rockets fail and send the stock price soaring down? Will you buy PayPal if they grow their ads platform? Will you buy intel if their chips pickup steam and their foundry is, as predicted, the second largest foundry by around 2030? See, that would make it value now, but that’s many years away, you could probably purchase in 2028 for just as good of a deal… or could you?",3,9,2025-10-21 18:15:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ockh3m/value_companies_perceived_as_value_traps/,2025-10-23 09:08:11.992466,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['rocket', 'market cap']",0.7114285714285714

Adobe ($ADBE) appeared simultaneously as our #1 quality pick and #4 value pick. This is not something that happens often. Quality stocks trade at premiums. Many value stocks usually fail quality filters. When both frameworks flag the same company, it's worth investigating. **What Our Quality Framework Found** We analyze 10 years of financials across 10 weighted dimensions (returns, margins, cash flow, growth, leverage, etc.) and compare against sector peers. Adobe scored 4.03/5 on absolute metrics and 4.18/5 versus 79 tech sector companies. Key findings: * Margins: 89% gross, 41% EBITDA, 30% net (99th percentile for gross margins in tech) * Returns: 55% ROE, 35% ROIC (both top-decile versus sector) * Revenue CAGR: 18.1% over 2015-2024 ($4.8B to $21.5B) * Free cash flow: $1.3B to $7.8B over the decade * Peer rankings: 90th percentile for returns, 89th for margins, 84th for operational efficiency The business quality remained elite through October 2025 by both absolute and relative measures. **What Our Value Framework Found** Our 100-point value system (converting to 0-10 scale) requires stocks to pass profitability gates before scoring. Adobe scored 86/100 (8.6/10): * Traditional metrics: P/E of 21.75 (compressed from historical 30-40x), EV/EBITDA of 15.62 * DCF analysis: 52% upside to intrinsic value * Quality checks: Perfect scores on returns, profitability * Growth: 18.1% revenue CAGR over 10 years The value framework confirmed that quality metrics were available at compressed prices. **The Risks Are Real** We're transparent about the risks: * AI monetization is unproven. Firefly’s huge user base hasn’t translated into meaningful revenue yet. * Competition is heating up. Midjourney and Canva undercut Adobe on price and accessibility. * AI could shrink the market. Automation may reduce demand from creative professionals. * Analyst sentiment is cooling. Some expect slower FCF growth as rivals like Sora and Runway emerge. Our frameworks measure current business quality and valuation. They can't predict whether Adobe successfully monetizes AI or defends against competition. Curious to hear thoughts from the community: How do you balance fundamental quality assessment with risks in situations like this?

Consolidating for nearly two months. Nvidia’s key points 1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China. 2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of. 3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth.

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential.

T,1o6dg71,investing,Why I’m starting to question the whole “invest early” advice,"So I’ve been investing since January, mostly ETFs and some crypto. My portfolio’s around €5.5k right now, up about 9% this year (roughly €400–€500 profit). And I also run a small reselling business. I buy stuff and flip it for profit. After doing some quick math, I noticed something pretty crazy: If I put €500 into my business, I usually make like 2.5x that back within 2 months. If I put that same €500 into the stock market, I’d maybe get 13% in a good year. That’s a huge difference. So it got me thinking, why does everyone say “start investing as early as possible” and “the stock market will make you rich”? If I had just reinvested everything into my business, I’d probably be sitting on like €15k by now. Honestly, I think investing makes way more sense later like when I’m in uni and can’t focus on my business as much, or when I’ve got a stable job (I want to become a pilot eventually) and can invest a few thousand a month long-term. Right now, while I can actively grow my money way faster through business, putting it in the market just feels kinda pointless.

T,1ob4ilg,ValueInvesting,Value investing is a brain dead term,"Every investor wants to generate value for themselves and is looking to buy a company at a good valuation compared to its long term prospect. Disconnecting value from growth might be one of the most stupid concepts ever. Growth is literally the one and only thing that drives up company value and therefore stock price. So what is ”value investing” even supposed to mean? When I judge it by the posts in this sub, it’s basically about buying long term established companies with an historically low P/E and thinking that they found an ”undervalued” company. Well guess what, most of the time this company has peaked and is starting to slowly die or at least the growth is slowing down, so the market isn’t willing to put the same historical premium on its cashflows. People turn to ”value investing”, because it gives them a sense of security. But nobody is not value investing.

T,1o9i2u1,ValueInvesting,This bubble is going to explode soon. People are angry and buying gold,"People buy gold. If I can’t afford a house because it costs 3 million dollars and I earn 3000 dollars, the best solution is to ignore paper money and the dollar. High home prices and low salaries wouldn’t exist if people ignored the price in paper money and found another value of exchange. And that is gold. Gold that cannot be multiplied or controlled. I buy a bag of gold coins and don’t care about banks. The gold price is rising and will keep rising. Contrary, Bitcoin is becoming a meme. It was supposed to be digital gold, but it’s laughable. No asset that is in the hands of rich people who can manipulate prices through insider trading is safe. So what will happen next? Gold rush a run to traditional physical assets, a run away from stocks and digital assets, Bitcoin, and crypto scams. A run away from the dollar. The dollar will devalue, and no one will respect that paper money. What is happening in the world right now is a boiling pot that is about to explode. That’s because of a sick situation people realizing they are slaves, destined to work and have nothing today, not even a secure job, while the rich keep getting richer. * Unemployment is growing. * Enormous unemployment among young college graduates. * Smart, angry people laid off from corporations. * People are angry at this system and buy gold, trash the dollar, because in a world where people with years of experience can’t find a job since they’re replaced and cost-cut, those are bad times, so they secure their savings by buying gold and leaving the dollar system. * Falling birth rates people can’t afford homes because of enormous growing prices. * Corporations paying low taxes. * Worsening access to healthcare expensive healthcare. * Life becoming worse and people getting more angry. So the next bubble, the next big crisis and black swan event, is the gold rush and devaluation from the dollar to physical assets like metals, gold, and diamonds. Paper money becoming useless in a system made only for the rich. People will try to create their own independent payment system, away from the rich elites trade for trade, skill for skill, I help you with that, you help me with this bypassing paper money.

Yeah, I know… probably dumb to let it sit this long, but I kept waiting for the “right time” and ended up just watching the market go up. Figured it’s finally time to make a move and get my money working. Planning to hold 5+ years, maybe longer. Quick background: • I run a business in the advertising space, salary around $150K/yr as CEO. • Expecting a $10–15M exit from the biz in the next 2 years. • Not relying on this $500K for living expenses, just want smart long-term growth. • Comfortable with risk, but don’t wanna be glued to charts all day. Context / bias: I’m from the ad side and we spend 8 figures a year on Meta (Facebook/Instagram). I’ve seen how strong their ad platform still is — AI targeting, reels, conversion improvements, etc. So yeah, I’m pretty bullish on Meta long-term. But I’m not sure how much I should actually put into a single stock vs just going broad ETFs. Questions: • Is it a decent time to start investing right now, or better to wait / DCA in over time? • What % would you personally put into one stock (like Meta) if you have high conviction? • What ETFs / allocation would make sense here (S&P 500, total market, international, bonds, etc)? • Would you go lump sum or DCA since I’m planning to hold long-term anyway?

Is there anything I can buy that would give me a decent dividend in US$ so I don't have to transfer money back into my CAD account. Looking for something similar to a ZMMK.

T,1o425zs,ValueInvesting,Who will win from Trump’s 100% tariffs on China? A supply chain investor’s breakdown,"Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on all Chinese imports is more than a headline, it’s a global reshuffling of cost structures, logistics, and industrial policy. While short-term market reactions were negative (S&P down \~2.7%), investors who understand supply chain geography may find new winners across several regions. # 1. The U.S. Manufacturing Revival Seven U.S. manufacturers across consumer electronics, apparel, and home goods show full export readiness and ISO certifications. Key Standouts: * Harman International Industries (electronics) — global export networks, strong scale; could benefit via reshoring and tariff insulation. *(owned by Samsung Electronics \[005930.KS\])* * WestPoint Home Inc. (home goods) — operates U.S. and global plants, supplies Target and Marriott. * Fashion Atlas Group / Oceanaire Sportswear (apparel) — domestic, ISO-certified producers aligned with sustainability mandates.

Co., and Fashion Hometex (Thailand) show lead times of 30–45 days and hold certifications like WRAP, OEKO-TEX, SA8000. Key Insight: Vietnam’s integrated garment ecosystem can absorb 20–25% of China’s apparel export capacity in 2–3 years.

India: The Packaging and FMCG Powerhouse India’s industrial base has matured into a multi-sector export engine — especially FMCG packaging, consumer durables, and apparel. Top Performers: * ITC Limited (NSE: ITC) – integrated FMCG + packaging conglomerate; exports to Walmart and McCormick. * Cosmo Films (NSE: COSMOFILMS) – BOPP and specialty packaging films, serving global brands. * Knack Packaging – clients include Walmart, P&G, and Cargill. * Primacy Industries – contract fragrance and aerosol manufacturer exporting to the U.S. Investor Takeaway: India is the largest “China+1” beneficiary for light manufacturing and packaging.

These are the ones I recognize from everyday grocery shopping and I have bought from every single one of these brands over the years. I sometimes still buy Alba sunscreen and Maranatha almond butter at Costco.

Their balance sheet shows only about $7M in assets, yet their press releases claim they hold over $13B worth of Ethereum. If that were true, they’d either be reporting billions of crypto on their balance sheet like MicroStrategy does, or they’d disclose assets under custody like Coinbase. They do neither. Instead, they issue sensational PRs while filing bare-bones financials with the SEC. To make things stranger, their previous auditor was banned by the PCAOB for issuing false audit opinions, and their new auditor is another tiny firm with its own compliance history.

UNH,1ntma2e,ValueInvesting,Help set up my mom for retirement,"Hi, My mom retirement fund is 1.1m, she worked hard to make that money and now she's not sure what to do with it. Vast majority of the money came from real estate over 30 years. I am not an experienced investor, but I understand that diversification helps and timing the market is almost impossible. So through meeting with CFPs and CFAs, doing my own research I have suggested the following: 10% (~100k) in physical gold 25% (~250k) in flex GIC returning 5.8% 75% (~750k) in the equities (650k in diversified ETFs and 100k in individual stocks). The basis for putting 35% outside the market is to protect her for at least 3-4 years of income in case the market crashes. She needs ~100k per year, she doesn't own a property and she helps my sister go through university. My questions: 1. What do you think of the approach, any critiques? 2. Where would you invest the 100k in individual stocks? I think rare earths will grow significantly in the US, and then some defensive positions like UNH and LULU (high cf, good pe compared to industry).

T,1nuy1s9,ValueInvesting,How Dating and Investing Are Similar-,"When a person is in their youth, let’s call it from sixteen to thirty years old, finding a life partner is of interest, if not a high priority, for many people. There are societies where cultural norms dictate the available universe of potential mates. The approach one takes in finding a potential mate is as diverse as there are humans. Some might place a high priority on physical appearance. Others might place a heavier weighting on friendship and compatibility. Let’s consider two approaches. The first person is a social butterfly who is active in the bar scene. Each weekend, they go with their friends to a local club to have a good time and enjoy the allure of finding their one-in-a-million dreamboat. On occasion, they might drink a few too many beverages and engage in extracurricular activities where they wind up in situations where they don’t quite remember, or are comfortable with, the person they are now faced with, or, um, ahem, even closer. The second person approaches their social activities differently. They concentrate on attending weekly and monthly religious ceremonies and events. A heightened emphasis is placed on understanding where the potential mate is from, meeting their parents, and spending time learning what makes them happy, sad, indifferent, or excited. A friendship is formed through learning, and a common bond is established over their shared views on various subjects in which they both participate. Clearly, these are distinct approaches to the same problem. We can apply this idea to the current state of affairs in the investment world. As of August 2025, in US public markets, there are currently approximately 4,300 ETFs (exchange traded funds) as compared to 4,200 publicly traded companies. In terms of recent trends, the number of ETFs grew by approximately 4 per day in 2025, while the available publicly traded companies continued to shrink, losing nearly 500 in 2024 alone, down from 6,500 in 1997. I bring this up because the investment world has been moving to a passive approach for a long time, and the amount of capital allocated to index and ETF-based approaches is now [greater than the active ](https://www.globaltrading.net/passive-funds-extend-their-dominance-in-equity-investments-in-2024/)methods. Over the last few decades, the S&P 500 has been the star performer of all indexes. Currently, 35% of the S&P 500 is made up of seven companies. Many other ETFs have a similar dynamic where a few companies constitute a heavy weight within the instrument. Prominent examples include the QQQ, IVV, SPLG, VOO, VGT, and TOPT, not to mention the Ark fund complex. Investors are drawn to the lower risk, ease, and cost of indexes and ETFs and have been rewarded by owning instruments tied to large tech companies, which have grown substantially. The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence over the last few years has led to high-profile recent offerings like ARTY, CHAT, BAI, AGNT, and IVES. Investors who adopt this approach believe what has been working will continue to work. The current valuations of these assets are, let’s be kind, historically elevated. How do I approach the market knowing these facts? One caveat, I am an active investor, so I am biased, and I am talking my book. ETFs are made up of different assets, but in most or many cases, the holdings are individual public companies. One is a derivative of the other. If you understand derivatives, you know the secondary is a function of the primary. As such, what matters is the performance of the core companies. The ETFs will rise, and fall based on those entities. So, for an active investor, more attention to ETFs is good because less capital is directed toward finding and analyzing individual companies. The number of individually listed enterprises shrinking means the strongest survive. History has proven that Darwinian concepts are applicable in markets as well. It has long been understood that the small and micro-cap areas are the most inefficient areas of the market. Inefficiency is good for active investors because it means mis-pricing. It is also excellent for active investment because if one is accurate about the analysis of a small company, the runway for expansion is much greater than a bigger entity. Conversely, investors who allocate capital into areas where there is more competition and great enthusiasm are placing a great deal of belief in the premise that massive amounts of capital allocation will yield acceptable returns. When large amounts of money are involved, just because it is spent doesn’t mean an above-average return is earned. Look at what Stevie baby spent on the Mets payroll this year, and uh, no playoffs again. In sum, less competition, fewer investors looking, mis-priced assets, large expansion possibilities versus greater numbers of instruments, top-heavy weighted assets, recent outperformance, and elevated valuations. Capital will flow where it is best treated. Markets change, like nearly everything else, though often it takes decades, not years for the difference to become evident. What one chooses is based on their own perceptions, just like choosing an ideal mate. Future returns depend on your selection, so be thoughtful.",0,7,2025-10-01 03:46:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nuy1s9/how_dating_and_investing_are_similar/,2025-10-23 09:08:14.283915,0.4,$T,0.6,[],[],0.7

T,1o1fodv,ValueInvesting,Thoughts on APA Corp (APA) ?,"I have a stock screener on Schwab I like to periodically look through that focuses on dividend paying companies (criteria consists of the stock price being below $100, an ex-dividend date within the next month, a net profit margin greater than 5%, a stock price decrease/increase of -50% to 25% year to date, and a forward P/E ratio below 20) Today I saw APA Corp pop up on the screen for the first time. At first glance it interested me, but was hoping someone more informed may be able to provide some basics about the company and share their opinions. Google’s overview says APA is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration - … no clue what that means, but I will be looking into it. APA currently trades just below $25.00 and offers a $0.25 quarterly dividend. APA has a PE ratio 8.27 (forward PE of 7.19). This past quarter (June report) shows APA doing $2.19B in revenue and $603M in net income (while having a market cap of $8.8B). Revenue has been up and down over the past 5 years, as has net income, yet they haven’t had a big loss in net income since Q1 of 2020 (where they had net income of -$4.4B, since then their least profitable quarter was only a -$0.22B loss). Revenue has been above $1.5B every quarter since Q4 of 2020 (trending relatively upward). A quick google search showed me that APA has bought back 92 million shares for more than $3.07B (nearly half of their market cap) since 2018. APA also plans to “return 60% of its free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases). APA does have a decent amount of debt, close to $6B, with a debt to equity ratio of 1.5ish. In writing this post I’ve actually found a little more about APA’s business model. They are a producer of crude oil and natural gas (where a 1.5 D/E ratio is relatively common) … much less exciting than I was hoping though. Still going to post this, as I’ve already typed out a good bit. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, but I am not as excited about APA as I was when I started the post.

T,1oaqzdg,ValueInvesting,Inside ARM: How the World’s Chip Architect Keeps Its Edge (and Why Investors Should Care),"Arm Holdings is a **British semiconductor and software design company that** (unlike many other semiconductor companies) **creates the architectures and blueprints for most of the world's mobile and embedded processors.** Instead of manufacturing chips, ARM licenses its Intellectual Property (IP) to companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia, which integrate them into their own products. Their **low-power and high-efficiency designs** dominate smartphones, tablets and IoT, devices, and are rapidly expanding into data centers, automotive systems and AI accelerators. Because ARM earns royalties from every chip built using its technology, **it benefits from the global growth of computing without the capital intensity of chip fabrication**. This is reason why ratios for this company cannot be compared with companies from chip making industry, simply said, ARM is selling licenses and collecting royalties on their design so their growth margin will always be bigger when compared to other industries. (this is very significant in later stages of this post) # How ARM is making money? There are two interconnected revenue streams: licensing and royalties. The **licensing segment** of business brings in upfront payments from companies that want to use ARM's IP. For example, a chipmaker like Qualcomm or MediaTek pays ARM for the right to use its Cortex or Neoverse cores, or to design their own chips based on the ARM instruction set (Best example is Apple with their M chips). **Royalty business** is where real long-term compounding happens. Once a costumer starts mass-production chips that use ARM's designs, ARM earns a small royalty for every chip shipped. This royalty is never bigger than 1-2% and usually is in range of few cents, but, ARM based chips are sold across smartphones, IoT devices, and increasingly data centers and vehicles. This is high-margin, recurring revenue that scales together with global semiconductor production. **Licensing part of business tends to be shaky part** of business. Reason behind it is that each license is one-time event and ARM never can be 100% sure when next large upfront fee will be paid by some chipmaker. **Also semiconductor industry is highly cyclical**, when new process node (like 3nm) or new product cycle begins industry invest heavily in new chip desings. But, this part of business is very important because licensing builds the pipeline, while royalties monetize that pipeline for years and decades (some of designs made in 1990's still make revenue for ARM). When looking QoQ we can see increase on both Total Revenue (12.1%) and Royalty Revenue(25.3%). In the same time, revenue from licensing made around -1%. Company **CEO Rene Haas is estimating** that ARM will continue revenue **growth somewhere between 20%-30%** which is somehow positive outlook when we take in consideration that in last TTM total revenue increased around 17%. ARM's extraordinary gross margin (97%) is product of their business model. To say it simple as possible the cost to ""produce"" one more ARM license or to collect one more royalty is close to zero, while the revenue can be in the millions. However, the trade is that ARM's operating expanses are very high, especially R&D and personnel costs (their product is human intelligence). # For ARM Research and Development is not optional Practically more than 50% of revenue goes toward development of new CPU architectures, designing new CPU & GPU cores. **It is easy to say that for ARM R&D is not optional it is their business.** It fuels future royalty streams by ensuring they are always ahead of competition. Cutting R&D spending at Arm would be a direct path to stagnation. Within a few years, competitors would start catching up, leading to fewer licensing deals - and naturally, shrinking royalty streams that follow. It’s the same pattern we saw with Nokia: once the leader in mobile phones, slowed its innovation, and eventually became a shell of its former self, surviving today mostly on patent and licensing revenue. # Competition and RISC-V As of writing this text Arm is holding big advantage with its technology. **They work together with Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Nvidia** and others on broad range of products. In last few years most important cooperation is on AI technology where ARM is one of the biggest players. With that in mind according to the last quarter transcript ARM is expecting to shift their market share of ARM neoverse-based chips to top hyperscalers to nearly 50% in this year. **ARM's main competitor is RISC-V**, an open source instruction set architecture developed by global community of contributors who improve and use the sam ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) model. Major players such as Google, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, SiFive, Alibaba, and Western Digital are actively involved - many of them still rely on Arm but are experimenting with RISC-V in parallel. Strategically speaking, RISC-V remains a long way from posing a serious threat. Arm continues to **dominate the mobile CPU market with over 99% share**, and it’s hard to imagine that position changing significantly over the next 5-10 years. # Final thoughts Arm’s future is closely tied to **Apple**, one of its largest clients. With Apple’s global dominance in both computers and mobile devices, Arm benefits from a stable and expanding base for its **licensing and royalty business**, making it a potential safe haven within the semiconductor ecosystem. **Strong competitive moat** is likely to produce significant growth in the coming years. However, it’s important to keep an eye on the next few earnings reports - the company’s**P/E ratio, typically between 80 and 100**, reflects a very high valuation. While many investors view Arm as more than just another chip company, such a premium still demands careful monitoring. At the same time, Arm is **actively expanding** into higher-value markets such as **AI, cloud computing, and automotive**. These projects are still early-stage bets, but it’s very good to see the company investing in long-term growth and diversifying beyond its traditional mobile stronghold.",4,0,2025-10-19 14:26:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oaqzdg/inside_arm_how_the_worlds_chip_architect_keeps/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.017515,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'rally', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.6228571428571429

T,1o6pa3g,stocks,Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market,"Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach. Revenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity. Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control.

T,1o5l8u1,investing,Why I’m Not Buying $KTOS Even Though I Love the Tech,"I’ve been following Kratos Defense ($KTOS) for years, and few companies in defense tech excite me as much. They’re at the cutting edge of unmanned systems, hypersonic testing, and satellite communications. The stuff military R&D budgets dream about. But despite the tech, I’m staying on the sidelines for now. Kratos has transformed from a niche contractor into a next-gen defense innovator. They build reusable jet-powered drones (like the Valkyrie), hypersonic test vehicles, and satellite ground systems used by the U.S. military and allies. Revenue is ramping fast (up 13% y/y in the first half of 2025), backed by a record $1.4 billion backlog. The Unmanned Systems division alone grew nearly 30% last year. They’re in the right place at the right time, with defense budgets expanding globally and new programs in drone warfare and missile defense gaining traction. So what’s the problem? Profitability. Last quarter’s operating margin was roughly 1%. That’s not a typo. Legacy players like $LMT or $RTX earn ten to fifteen times that. Kratos is stuck with cost overruns on fixed-price contracts and inflation-bitten components it can’t reprice until new production lots kick in. Management is trying to fix it by renegotiating contracts, producing ahead of awards, and building its own jet engine plant to reduce supplier dependence but those fixes take time. For now, every extra dollar of revenue barely drops to the bottom line. Then comes valuation. The stock trades like a software company, not a defense contractor: more than 200× forward earnings and 140× forward EV/EBITDA. Even drone peer $AVAV looks cheap beside it. The stock has tripled in a year, so the market’s already priced in flawless execution. When a defense stock trades like a startup, you need either sustained margin expansion or a reset in expectations ... and I don’t see either yet. Valkyrie just became a DoD Program of Record (translation: procurement dollars are coming). The hypersonic test and space-comms businesses have multi-year growth potential. Kratos’ $13 billion opportunity pipeline is proof of credibility with the Pentagon and primes. If they can scale production efficiently and push EBITDA margins into the mid-teens, the stock could grow into its valuation. But as of today, the math doesn’t work.

T,1o5oyng,ValueInvesting,"District Metals (DMX.V): Capitalizing on Multiple Global Headwinds for AI, EU Energy and Technology Independence, and Sustainable Clean Power","I found this stock after researching a few different areas to grow with some of the more recent trends. Here is a few that I think illustrate the problem: 1. AI in one form or another is here to stay, and while many of the tech stocks have jumped significantly over the past years, up the value chain is something that gets less attention: how to power them. AI is expected to drive an 165% increase in data center power by 2030 (Goldman Sachs \[1\]). 2. The EU is concerned with both digital sovereignty \[2\] and energy independence \[3\]. I won’t go into all of the initiatives and reasons why, but essentially the EU made a mistake in creating overreliance on Russian energy, and also is alarmed at their digital dependence on the US. The Ukraine war has highlighted strategic security gaps on both of these fronts. 1. The average cost of running a datacenter in Sweden is much smaller than other countries, due to favorable electricity prices \[4\]. As such, some figures put the CAGR for the Data Center market in Sweden at 17.57%. 2. Historically, the EU has turned its nose at the dangers of Nuclear power. Much criticism is levied at Angela Merkel, who also saw an increase in reliance on Russian energy during her tenure. However, recent developments due to the war, as well as advances in Nuclear safety, shows the tides turning on nuclear power generation \[6\]. 1. While the US has declined on this front, the EU is still very much pushing for sustainable energy sources. While Nuclear isn’t really considered renewable, it is considered clean, and nuclear energy makes up around 1/4th of EU energy production today. So, we are betting on Nuclear being a big component of the future for the EU, and abroad. So, why District Metals? If you want to own the end-to-end cycle of your energy infrastructure, that includes mining for Uranium. In the EU, Sweden has the highest amount of unconventional uranium resources. The Viken deposit, wholly owned by District Metals, is the largest undeveloped mineral resource estimate of Uranium in the world \[7\]. One impact assessment puts the Viken project at a net present value of 1.039B, assuming $65.3/pound of U3O8, which is now at $\~80/Pound \[9\]. Uranium resources haven’t been able to be developed or deeply explored due to legislation preventing mining in 2018 in Sweden, but with new political headwinds and wide support, this law is likely to be overturned on January 1st \[8\]. CEO Garret Ainsworth has a track record of other mining projects, including NextGen where he started as VP, overseeing a market capitalization from $50m CDN to $3B CDN. But, worst case is the project doesn’t take off in the long run, I think the short term shows significant upside as the regulatory landscape changes. \[1\] [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030) \[2\] [https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030\_en](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en) \[3\] [https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/motion/focus/eu-budget-ensures-european-energy-independence-through-repowereu\_en](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/motion/focus/eu-budget-ensures-european-energy-independence-through-repowereu_en) \[4\] [https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/data-centre-growth-in-the-nordics](https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/data-centre-growth-in-the-nordics) \[5\] [https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sweden-data-center-market](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sweden-data-center-market) \[6\] [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power) \[7\] [https://www.placera.se/pressmeddelanden/district-metals-district-confirms-the-viken-energy-metals-deposit-and-identifies-high-potential-targets-elsewhere-on-the-viken-property-in-sweden-with-airborne-mobilemt-survey-results-20250924](https://www.placera.se/pressmeddelanden/district-metals-district-confirms-the-viken-energy-metals-deposit-and-identifies-high-potential-targets-elsewhere-on-the-viken-property-in-sweden-with-airborne-mobilemt-survey-results-20250924) \[8\] [https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/legislative-proposals-to-lift-swedens-uranium-mining-ban](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/legislative-proposals-to-lift-swedens-uranium-mining-ban) \[9\] [https://secure.kaiserresearch.com/i/jk/tr16/TRCZQ20101019.pdf](https://secure.kaiserresearch.com/i/jk/tr16/TRCZQ20101019.pdf)",1,0,2025-10-13 16:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o5oyng/district_metals_dmxv_capitalizing_on_multiple/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.046205,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['puts', 'support', 'market cap']",0.6171428571428571
T,1nxqila,ValueInvesting,Is The Platform Group (TPG) a Value Trap?,"So I’ve been digging into The Platform Group (ETR: TPG), and on paper the numbers look too good to be true. Super low P/E, growth story across 20+ platforms (48.2 % latest half), raised guidance, etc. At first glance, it screams “hidden gem.” But the more I look, the more I feel like this could be a value trap — and I can’t quite put my finger on the exact reason. A few things that stand out to me: Revenue growth looks strong, but a lot of it is acquisition-driven. Yes, management says ~59% of growth was organic, which sounds good, but I still wonder how sustainable that is across so many different verticals. They’re very acquisitive. Constantly buying new platforms in different industries. That creates complexity and execution risk, and makes it hard to judge whether the “core” business is actually stable. The valuation is extremely cheap (like 3.2x free cash flow, do they have quite a bit of debt because of acquisitions, ev to fcf is 5.2 ), and they still expect to grow 17 precent next year) That makes me think the market knows something I don’t. Sometimes cheap really does mean cheap for a reason. My gut feeling: TPG might be a classic roll-up play where acquisitions boost the top line, but eventually integration, debt, or flatlining organic growth could catch up. Does anyone here have a stronger view on this? Am I overthinking it and this is just a massively overlooked stock, or is there a hidden bear case (governance, leverage, industry cycles) that explains why it’s priced like this? Curious to hear other opinions and maybe somebody found something i didn't.

T,1o5yzjm,ValueInvesting,A Follow-up on Surge Components ($SPRG),"Taking WB’s advice, a few weeks ago I was flipping through companies when I stumbled upon a tiny OTC pink Sheet company called Surge Components ($SPRG).

NO DEBT, but access to a $3mm revolver. I conservatively value the company at ~$17.3mm and to the right buyer, north of ~$20.5mm. I’m buying under $2.73 per share. I could easily see this trading in the $3.40-3.60 range. One of the problems I see here is the volume.

The company plans to close 900 underperforming stores and reduce corporate jobs, with employees receiving support packages and benefit extensions. Savings from these cuts will be reinvested into store redesigns and innovations, with about $150,000 planned per location. By fiscal 2026, Starbucks targets a 30% reduction in costs and will introduce a new standalone store design featuring 32 seats and a drive-thru.

The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%) Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,2025-09-30 01:30:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.309994,0.4,$T,0.8,[],[],0.6

T,1oda3sw,wallstreetbets,Still holding 🥴,"My 7 year old son asked me to take him to McDonald’s the other day. I asked him why, and he said his mom told him to tell me, “you’re 3 months behind and it’s the least you can do.” I told him I couldn’t afford it right now but I’d take him the next day. I was hoping he would forget, he has severe autism, like his stepdad. Well, the next day, he didn’t forget. I asked what he wanted so badly at McDonald’s. He replied that he wanted a happy meal with monopoly. I dont even know how my son knows about monopoly, I’ve sure never played monopoly with him. So, later for lunch I take him to McDonald’s, just like I promised I would. I got him a nugget happy meal, which evidently, it doesn’t come with any monopoly pieces in the first place. How was I supposed to know this? He’s the one who asked for this. I just wasted $9 on a happy meal that doesn’t even give me a chance to win $1 million dollars. My son ate 1 of the 4 chicken nuggets, and he ate half of the fries. He drank half of the milk jug and ate all of the apple slices. My debit card didn’t have enough money for a meal, so luckily I got to eat 3 chicken nuggets, some fries, and a few sips of milk. I took my son back to his mother’s house, and she had Pizza Hut and ice cream waiting. I asked why my son didn’t want any of the McDonald’s, and he told me mom promised him pizza for dinner tonight. This is great and all for him, but why even waste our money on McDonald’s in the place if he was saving his appetite? Obviously this was a bit annoying, so I did ask my son about this a week later when I saw him again. He told me, “Dennis, (my son calls me by my first name), I wanted to win you the Monopoly money so mommy loves you again and you can move back in with me, mommy, and daddy.”",187,56,2025-10-22 14:39:44,https://i.redd.it/56jhhvh9dowf1.jpeg,2025-10-23 09:06:38.670393,0.35,$T,1.0,[],['calls'],1.0

T,1o93l4a,stocks,Two small banks just exposed big loan losses and it might only be the tip of the iceberg,"When you see one cockroach, there are usually more hiding somewhere. That’s exactly how the market feels right now. wo small regional banks just reported a sharp jump in bad loans, and in this high-rate environment, that’s basically a grenade rolling under the financial sector’s table. Yesterday, bank stocks dropped more than 5%, the VIX spiked 15%, and Treasury yields plunged below 4%. Gold surged as investors scrambled for safety. It all makes sense when cash flow dries up and credit risk rises, assets that don’t depend on anyone’s solvency, like gold, start looking very attractive. I’ve always kept a portion of my portfolio in cash-flow assets, but this new wave of regional bank stress is making me rethink things. If credit tightening continues, which sectors become the next minefields? Commercial real estate? Small-cap lenders? Or even parts of the consumer credit market? At the same time, every crisis creates opportunity. If smaller banks pull back on lending, companies with strong balance sheets and access to cheap capital might actually *gain* market share. Maybe that’s where value quietly builds while everyone else panics. I’m curious how everyone here is positioning. Are you rotating into safety (gold, Treasuries, defensive stocks), or are you using this volatility to hunt for quality names at better prices?

T,1nvbe1f,stocks,Amazon launches ‘price-conscious’ grocery brand with most products under $5,"Amazon on Wednesday expanded its private-label grocery lineup with the launch of a new brand aimed at “price-conscious” shoppers, with most products priced under $5. The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label. “During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement. It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.” The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux. The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K. At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks. The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

T,1nxas4k,financialindependence,Hit the 100k goal today at 26,"I passed $100k net worth today at 26, and wanted to document the journey and celebrate a bit. I’ve managed to reach this mostly on my own, which makes me feel proud and incredibly lucky. Here’s my breakdown. **Net worth distribution – $100,832 total** * Roth IRA: $34,707 (Rolled over a small 401k balance in 2023 and have maxed it each year since, investing in index mutual funds). * Pension: $37,183 (Will likely do a rollover into an IRA when I leave this job and get a one-time 50% match). * Brokerage: $2,425 (Opened this year). * Emergency HYSA: $26,517 (A year worth of living expenses). * No debt. **Job and salary progression** * 20 to 22 years old: $38-39k * 22 to 25 years old: $58-70k, (6 months of $82k before layoff) * 25 to 26 years old: $70k-74k (expecting a 5% raise next year) **Biggest net worth boosters** * **Graduating from college at 20 without debt.** I have to thank my lovely grandma for letting me live with her rent-free throughout most of college. I also graduated debt-free through cheap in-state tuition, working various jobs, and qualifying for Pell grants/academic scholarships. * **Having a debt-averse mentality.** Seeing my parents constantly fight and stress over money did a number on me. I have a strong savings habit as a result and avoid debt as much as possible. * **Doing low-cost hobbies/activities.** I enjoy working out, playing video games, and playing instruments. These hobbies have fixed low costs for the most part, and they bring me more joy than drinking often or going out every other night. When I do hang with friends, the nights out are sparse and we usually play board games, yap, or do free things outdoors. * **Living below my means and automating savings.** When I get paid, the first thing I do is transfer money to savings/investing accounts. My housing costs have stayed around $1,000 or less in a HCOL by finding good deals, and living with roommates or my partner. When I had to upgrade my car four years ago, I used my local credit union for a lower interest rate and made a large downpayment. I also picked a gas-efficient vehicle that gets me from A to B reliably, but it’s not anything fancy or modern at this point. * **Spending intentionally – more on what I care about, less on what I don’t.** If I make large purchases, it’s usually for hobbies like making music, going to concerts, or traveling abroad once a year. Other than that, I don’t shop often, eat out more than 1-2 times a week, or let my lifestyle inflate. I think this balance has kept me motivated in the long run. * **Educating myself.** For the last three years, I’ve been consuming all sorts of personal finance media like audiobooks, YouTube videos, podcasts, subreddits, and blogs. It’s been both inspiring and instrumental in getting me here. I only wish I had started sooner… but don’t we all? This year, I began tracking all transactions to better understand my financial behavior and create a better budget next year. **Current goals** I’m turning 27 soon and aiming to reach at least $200k by 30. With my emergency fund fully stocked, I’m now prioritizing the brokerage account to FIRE in my 50s and take a long trip in my 30s.

T,1o6t2i7,wallstreetbets,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion. **Executive Summary:** Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. **Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains** Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys). Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security). **Revenue Acceleration Levers** Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services). To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics. **Technology Roadmap & Differentiation** Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this: * Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft. * Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical). * Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream. Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere. Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables. **Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs** Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered UAV with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market. [Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk) [Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale. [Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET. **AI in print process optimization** Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware. **TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:** * Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified. * Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware. * Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA). * Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production. * Drones & UAVs - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing * AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat [Oh and lastly there is also this.](https://imgur.com/a/JtxgF9F) My review above might explain why a US representative, with a history of picking winners, that is sitting on the military construction subcommittee is buying $SSYS.

But is that true for the market today? Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty. Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns. For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years) and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers. Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25. So let's go with: * low: 20 * mid: 25 * high: 30 For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR. To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with: * low: 4% * mid: 6.5% * high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880) *(Note: these aren’t conservative.)* We now can get the terminal value: Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years current EPS = 219.52 From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations: * high: \~9% annual return * mid: \~4.7% annual return * low: \~1% annual return This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns. **Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.** The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth.

And even if you could, your return would likely remain the same. Great article from Scott Galloway's about the current bubble: >A few weeks ago, we warned that the AI economy, propped up by a web of circular financing deals, might be headed for a collapse. Since then, the deals have continued. Last week, a new circular deal emerged between AMD and OpenAI worth tens of billions of dollars. Just a few days later, a $2 billion funding agreement was announced between Nvidia and xAI. >What used to be a hot take is now the consensus. Mainstream media and even AI founders are saying AI is a bubble: >**Bret Taylor, OpenAI chair:** “I think we’re also in a bubble.” >**Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks:** “It’s peak AI bubble.” >What’s concerning is that much of the market’s strength — and the economy’s resilience — now seems to rely on that bubble. >AI companies have accounted for 80% of the gains in U.S. stocks year to date. >Technology and software investment (AI) was responsible for 92% of GDP growth in the first half of the year. Without it — GDP growth would have been flat. >This isn’t a controversial take anymore. So how are investors responding? One popular hedge this year has been gold. >Last week, gold hit $4,000 for the first time ever. The metal is up 121% since the end of 2022, its biggest rally since the 1970s. >Central banks are driving the demand for gold. Ninety-five percent of central banks plan to expand their gold reserves over the coming year. >This is part of the broader debasement trade — the idea that loose monetary policy (i.e., printing more and more money) will erode the value of fiat currencies. In this environment, investors seek hard assets like gold, which is scarce and has historically held its value better. >What started as institutional concern has now migrated to retail investors. Global gold ETFs hit $472 billion in assets under management (AUM), up 23% for the quarter to reach an all-time high. Gold has become a momentum trade. >Still, gold isn’t the only option. Historically, investing in the broader market at its peaks has had little impact on long-term returns. >The odds of a positive return if you invest in the S&P 500 and leave it for 10 years are ... 100%. >Trying to time the market or predict a bubble’s peak is nearly impossible, even for seasoned investors. >Consider this quote: >“By my count, we now have a stock bubble, a bond bubble, a gold bubble, a (new) housing bubble, a bitcoin bubble, a debt bubble, a profit bubble, a margin bubble, a Fed bubble, a dividend bubble, a social media bubble, a health care bubble, and an \[insert thing you don’t like\] bubble.” >Sounds like something from last week, right?

T,1o63dnv,stocks,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India. The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal. Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products. Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment. In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed. The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026. Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing. Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron. # Made in India by 2026 Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production. U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development. But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020. Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years. “It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added. India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint. Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

T,1o8izdu,investing,Contrarian POV: Why gold investing feels like the mother of all speculative bubbles,"Much of the current bull case for gold that’s been circulating in the financial media is U.S. or USD-centric. But gold has appreciated 50 to 70% YTD against all of the world’s major currencies, not just the USD. Including havens like Switzerland (CHF) 1) The weakening U.S. Dollar - The DXY bottomed in mid-September and has actually risen since. Gold was $3600 then; now it’s $4350. 2) The U.S. government shutdown - None of the previous 20+ shutdowns have ever caused permanent economic damage. It’s all political theater and will be resolved. 3) Federal Reserve easing - The bond market expects another 1% in easing over the next 12 months, taking rates down to neutral. The FOMC’s 3% neutral estimate hasn’t changed in a while. They only go below neutral during a recession. 4) Federal Reserve independence - During the September meeting, the rest of the FOMC treated Miran like a gadfly, voting 11-1 against him. 5) Geopolitical tensions - The Gaza conflict is now in a ceasefire. The Russia-Ukraine war is regionally contained. 6) Trade tensions - Trade deals have been negotiated with all of the largest trading partners except China. Trump has caved on China before; tariffs were 140% at one point before he lowered them. Notably, the bond market has not jumped in on the debasement trade. Treasury yields are at their second lowest of the year after the initial April tariff panic. In the current parabolic move that began on August 21, gold has risen from $3,350 to $4,350 per ounce, while many of the above bull-case catalysts have stabilized or even improved. RSI is at 90+ and prices are rising 1 to 3% almost every day on any news or no news. This feels like 1979 or 2011 all over again.",268,172,2025-10-16 21:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o8izdu/contrarian_pov_why_gold_investing_feels_like_the/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.465940,0.35,$T,0.8,[],['bull'],0.9057142857142856

You absolutely can walk away with gains and put it in a high yield savings account. You can wait till this settles and see how far down it goes. You really don’t have to go all in for the chance at a couple percent gains unless you actually want to. None of these people including me really know anything and they don’t care about you at all.

T,1np10yv,wallstreetbets,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it’s overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn’t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in. The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company’s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)—a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, “We process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,” underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD’s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta. Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD’s scalability and future cash flow. Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth—especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV. My positions included. This is not financial advice. Invest or not, at your own risk.",51,37,2025-09-24 02:47:55,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np10yv,2025-10-23 09:06:41.597793,0.35,$T,1.0,[],[],0.8999999999999999

Some are increased, decreased, threatened, negotiated etc. But China just pulled the rare earths card, which isn’t really a tariff, it’s simply a complete stop in supply, and since they have a monopoly on rare earths it’s strong card. What similar cards can the US pull in this situation???

T,1o78k68,stocks,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Great Returns On Investment","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion. **Executive Summary:** Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. **Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains** Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys). Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security). **Revenue Acceleration Levers** Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services). To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics. **Technology Roadmap & Differentiation** Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this: * Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft. * Drone structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical). * Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream. Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere. Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables. **Strategic Positioning in Drones** Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to drone endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered drone with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market. [Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk) [Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale. [Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET. **AI in print process optimization** Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware. **TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:** * Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified. * Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware. * Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA). * Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production. * Drones - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing * AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat [Oh and lastly there is also this.](https://imgur.com/a/JtxgF9F) My review above might explain why a US representative, with a history of picking winners, that is sitting on the military construction subcommittee is buying $SSYS.

T,1nwuti4,ValueInvesting,Realistic 10-year S&P 500 Returns,"**Are 10% annual returns realistic for the next decade?** Most investors on the internet talks about the expected 10% annual return, based on historical returns. But is that true for the market today? Historically the market is much cheaper than today, many investors seem not to care about valuations, and think AI will make explosive growth which will justify current valuations. However, we have a P/E over 31, and a Shiller P/E over 40, history tells us this won't end pretty. Lets look at the numbers and model out the scenarios, to see what we can expect for returns. For this model we need a low, medium and high terminal P/E (what P/E will the S&P 500 end at in 10 years) and we need low, medium and high estimated earnings growth numbers. Historically P/E has a median of 15, this is too low since it goes back to the 1800s, but in the past 50 years, the P/E median is \~20, in the past 20 and 10 years, it's \~25. So let's go with: * low: 20 * mid: 25 * high: 30 For growth estimations I looked at the past 20 years of earnings, 50% of the years were below or equal to 4% CAGR, which means this is most likely, and 20% of the years were above or equal to 8% CAGR. To give some room for more expected growth, let's go with: * low: 4% * mid: 6.5% * high 10% (only seen 4 times since 1880) *(Note: these aren’t conservative.)* We now can get the terminal value: Terminal value = current EPS \* (expected growh rate)\^10 years current EPS = 219.52 From here we can see what Compounded Annual Growth Rate will get to the current share price from the terminal value in 10 years. For my estimations I get the following annual returns from the estimations: * high: \~9% annual return * mid: \~4.7% annual return * low: \~1% annual return This shows another picture of what is preached about 10% annual returns. **Before the AI bulls comment, please read the section in my article about AI.** The S&P 500 is priced for perfection. But perfection almost never happens. At current valuations, investors are betting on a decade of above-average growth. Growth that history tells us is unlikely to materialize, and the assumptions are based on hype.

T,1npf99s,stocks,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032. But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push. The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news. Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.",47,79,2025-09-24 15:30:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npf99s/fermi_america_ipo_is_this_legit/,2025-10-23 09:07:08.984513,0.35,$T,0.9,[],['ipo'],0.8057142857142856

He also doubled down on being cautious with rate cuts, worried that moving too early could let inflation slip out of control. On top of that, tariffs are still a risk for prices, and while AI is boosting investment, the long-term impact is still up in the air. Powell also admitted the stock market looks pricey by historical standards, but kept a neutral tone. The only hint was that “moderately restrictive” policy could mean there’s room for gradual, measured cuts ahead. Bowman, on the other hand, took a much more aggressive stance — saying the Fed should cut sooner to prevent job losses and layoffs from snowballing. Personally, I think that carries more risk.

Some of the achievements from the last year: I asked for a raise that it took almost a year in a half to get it, but Im very happy to say that now is a six figure salary. Also I’ve being able to hit the bonuses that I couldn’t the previous years. The housing market is moving in our area and we found our dream place, that we purchased at the beginning of the year. It was a big milestone in our lives. Sold our good old 2003 German car (for more than I bought it 8 years ago), was replaced for a 2015 Japanese SUV for her business, paid in cash. I do basic maintenance on it myself. We keep saving and investing aggressively, avoiding debt at all costs. Our investments had grown despite the big purchases we did. Frugality is still a big part in our day to day routine, and side gigs whenever the opportunity comes. We didn’t upgrade any stuff at the new place and our furniture, bed, and kitchen stuff is close to 8 years. One upgrade we want to do is the mattress. We hope we can continue in similar situation and push it hard and for the next 5-10 years and that would leave us in a good financial position for the retirement phase.

T,1o3j65j,stocks,Gilat Satellite (GILT) might be seriously under radar and undervalued,"We are talking about an Israeli satcom/defense company with 35 years of story, it is valued like a small cap at $874,08 mi, despite projecting a guidance of $450 million total revenue in 2025, that's 45% increase compared to 2024 YoY. It is currently trading at around 25–30 times forward EPS despite growing revenue over 40% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA has climbed from about $30 million in 2022 to a projected $50 million for 2025, maintaining solid double-digit margins even as revenue grows more than 40%. But now let's dive in: What does it do? Gilat builds the hardware and software that let satellites deliver internet, military comms, and inflight Wi-Fi anywhere on Earth. It doesn’t launch satellites, it builds the infrastructure that makes satellites useful for its customers. Recent acquisitions: In recent years, Gilat acquired Wavestream, DataPath, and Stellar Blu to cover every layer of satellite communication, from radio amplifiers and tactical defense terminals to high-speed antennas for aircraft, turning itself from a modem maker into a full-scale satellite infrastructure company. All three based on American soil. Tech achievements: Gilat is transforming from a traditional satellite equipment supplier into a modern communications technology company. It develops cloud-based and AI-driven network platforms, advanced antennas for in-flight connectivity, and secure communication systems for defense and government use. Through its U.S. subsidiaries, the company now integrates hardware, software, and network management to support multi-orbit satellite operations (LEO, MEO, GEO). Its focus on virtualization, automation, and mobility positions Gilat as one of the leading players in next-generation satellite connectivity. Customers and contracts: Active contracts span defense, aviation, and government broadband programs worldwide with a total backlog of roughly US$450 million and customers ranging from the DoD (US$70 million), Israeli Army, OneWeb and national telecom agencies worldwide. Cash and debt: After the Stellar Blu acquisition, Gilat’s cash dropped from about $118 million to roughly $5 million, later rebuilt to around $65 million through a private share placement. Total debt stands near $100 million, leaving net debt around $30–40 million, a manageable level at less than one times projected 2025 EBITDA. Conclusion: In my view, Gilat is one of those “boring” and overlooked companies that deliver solid results and techs and have consistent growth, but lacks hype. It doesn’t build rockets or launch flashy satellites but it builds the wiring, antennas, and network brains that keep everything connected once those satellites are in orbit. It’s full of cables, code, and complex connectivity, but together they form the invisible backbone of defense communications, inflight Wi-Fi, and rural broadband. Gilat sits on the real infrastructure of global communication: profitable, under-the-radar, technically dense, and strategically essential for the defense industry, at a price of a small cap but with serious backlog, tech and guidance.",4,12,2025-10-11 01:41:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3j65j/gilat_satellite_gilt_might_be_seriously_under/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.888033,0.35,$T,0.9,[],"['rocket', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps', 'acquisition']",0.7342857142857142
T,1o6neku,ValueInvesting,stumbled onto something crazy by the looks of it (NTB - The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son),"Either I don't know anything about valuing banks or this is just too good to be true. Not sure, please help. Let's get right into it shall we: **Market cap = 1.75B** **Cash minus debt = 1.82 B** You might see this and conclude that maybe the bank is loss making or they are diluting like crazy or something is wrong? Well no because the buyback yield is 8% for the year, and they pay a dividend of 4.71% and have been for the last 10 years. With a payout ratio of 36% they are very healthy financially and profitable. **What do they do?** Well, they are a bank, for high net worth individuals who want to essentially not pay tax. The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son operates primarily as an offshore bank, focused on providing specialized financial services to high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and large corporations. Its operations are geographically concentrated in financially stable, low-tax jurisdictions, chiefly Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. **Moat** NTB's primary focus is on being a full-service bank and wealth manager in a few high-barrier-to-entry international financial centers like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, and Jersey. This specialization differentiates it from larger, global banks that treat these regions as secondary markets, and from smaller local banks that lack the international trust and wealth management scale. Founded in 1858, the bank has a deeply entrenched history and institutional reputation in its core markets. For high-net-worth clients whose primary concern is the safe, confidential, and multi-generational protection of their wealth, this long-standing stability and trusted brand acts as a significant moat that competitors cannot quickly purchase or replicate. The most substantial part of NTB’s moat comes from the difficulty and cost of moving its specialized services. Trust and Fiduciary Services involve complex legal, tax, and multi-jurisdictional administration. Changing the trustee of a complex, multi-generational trust is an expensive, legally onerous, and time-consuming process that strongly discourages customers from switching, making the revenue highly recurring. Private Banking relationships are often deep and built on decades of personal trust, which is highly sticky. **Catalyst** The management's primary focus is on returning capital, which includes a recently increased quarterly cash dividend and a new significant share repurchase authorization (1.5 million shares). With an 8% buyback yield and a stable dividend all we need to do is wait and collect until the market realizes the company's value.",10,10,2025-10-14 18:22:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6neku/stumbled_onto_something_crazy_by_the_looks_of_it/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.042204,0.35,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'loss']",0.7285714285714285

T,1o32ro4,investing,AI is Not In A Bubble or Is It?,"I was in the comments to a post about something completely different and inadvertently started a debate on this topic (LOL), so wanted to start its own discussion thread because this is an important topic with lots of viewpoints. I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct! My take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment. But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles. And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity. The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. Think about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer. The stock of pharmaceutical companies can go up thousands of percent overnight if you are there on the day that the breakthrough is discovered. That’s how you have to think about AI, but it’s nit just curing cancer (and it WILL do that), it’s curing every illness and disease known and unknown, it is automating everything, it will simplify attainment and use of logic and knowledge in all aspects of our lives. As the hardware becomes better and more efficient and everything is using it and it is all tied together, it will be even more efficient and effective. So, you’re paying 40x earnings? In the next 5-10 years earnings will be 1000x what they are today for a company like NVIDIA. Ownership is almost priceless, there’s no “Bubble”, they’ve discovered the cure for cancer and everything else; if it were a pharmaceutical company, the stock would have been up 10,000x by now.",0,44,2025-10-10 14:41:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o32ro4/ai_is_not_in_a_bubble_or_is_it/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.479740,0.35,$T,0.8,[],"['bear', 'earnings', 'dip']",0.7171428571428571

It’s year to year growth of revenue has been accelerating. It’s been opening new stores, which have been increasing revenue. It has a 6% profit margin, which is way higher than the average for competitors. They source their products domestically, so tariffs won’t have as big of an impact on them as competitors.

T,1o30vc8,ValueInvesting,There is a Bubble but until it pops theres still lots of money to be made,"I’m saying AI will stay hyped for at least another two years. Every breakthrough in AI needs more computing power. We might not get AGI, but we’re definitely not at the end of AI breakthroughs yet. The bubble will burst, but not next year. Until then, there’s still a lot of money to be made. These are all still growing industries that need computing power and aren’t even close to their end or a major slowdown. The demand for chips is insatiable. * Data centers are expanding faster than ever * Computers are turning into AI companions * Robotaxis will become fully autonomous * Humanoid robots will be everywhere Each breakthrough in AI needs more computing power. And it’s just getting started. We’re still early in that phase. Even though there will be a crash in the coming 10 years—because AGI just isn’t possible yet and the AI race is essentially an arms race: the first to reach AGI owns everything. Once the market realizes AGI isn’t achievable anytime soon, there will be a crash. Until then, there’s still a vast middle ground of near- to mid-term possibilities where these products, while far from AGI, will still be epoch-defining inventions that create astronomical value—and a lot of money to be made. So i personally believe for me it’s stupid not to invest in this amazing bull market, even at this all-time highs, just because of the fear of a crash coming soon .So i Just buy the dips and enjoy the gains, while adding a trailing stop-losses.

My thesis is pretty straightforward: cybersecurity demand isn’t slowing down, and CrowdStrike continues to execute well. Their revenue growth and margins are among the best in the sector, and the Falcon platform keeps expanding with strong retention and crosssell rates. Yes, the valuation is high, but quality growth rarely comes cheap. I see it as one of those companies that could keep compounding if you stay patient.

T,1o84sff,investing,No news is good news? - NTLA not raising capital,"Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) has seen a significant rally, up almost 300% recently, yet they still haven’t raised capital. NTLA is close to the commercialization of their first in vivo treatment and it is clear they will need more funding (currently enough cash till first half 2027). It would seem logical that the management would now raise cash and play it safe funding-wise. But they haven’t. I believe this could be very bullish signal for investors. Why wait to raise if the share price is already up 3x? Possibly because they expect even more upside in the near term, most likely tied to the clinical data readouts expected later this year. If management is confident that data will significantly move the stock higher, it would make sense to delay a raise and capture a much better valuation later. On the other hand the capital raise could be announced anytime now or there could be some other reason for silence. But I believe big moves are on the horizon. Can you think of a reason why a company would not immediately raise capital in similar situation?",7,7,2025-10-16 12:27:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o84sff/no_news_is_good_news_ntla_not_raising_capital/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.466677,0.35,$T,0.8,[],"['bull', 'rally']",0.7114285714285714

Recently I’ve gotten interested to create a saas (software as a service) business because I can’t turn 1k into 1 million dollars investing, the only way I can is through creating a business. I would really appreciate it if you guys would comment some pain points that I could possibly build a software to solve for. I got an idea to create an intrinsic value editor that allows users to calculate the fair value of a company’s stock by entering key inputs such as free cash flow, growth rate, and discount rate as well as many metrics from the financial statements. The editor automatically applies the intrinsic value formula and displays the results in real time. You can also set up if statements within the tool, for example, “if the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price, display a message that the stock is undervalued.” In addition, you can configure alerts so that when certain conditions are met — like a stock becoming 20% undervalued — the tool notifies you instantly. This makes the editor not only a calculator, but also a decision-support system for smarter investing.

T,1nsinid,ValueInvesting,Is Intel making a mistake?,"Full disclosure I have been interested in intel stock for a couple months now. Ever since the government took a 10% share in intel. I have been planning to invest 25k into the company but have not been liquid enough to do it just yet. I think intel despite its failings has a genuinely strong thesis. It’s the best US based foundry capable of producing microchips. With Chinas looming attack of Taiwan it is imperative for the U.S to have an answer for microchip production. China doesn’t have to actually take Taiwan to disable chip production , the process of making chips is so fragile that airburst from artillery could disrupt it. Microchips are core to Americas military , if TSMC is disabled we would see American military strength significantly weaken due to our weapons becoming difficult to replace and rearm. Intels success is literally a matter of national security. That being said Intel currently is a gutted company on the verge of collapse with only a few small signs of hope such as the NVDA investment. All of this being said I am not currently comfortable investing in Intel. Intel has seen a major increase in share price over the last couple weeks at a rate that seems detached from reality. Yes it has seen some minor wins but most of the gains are based on hype. “Intel in talks with TSMC” type of thing that doesn’t speak to the companies fundamentals. More so the stock has become a pseudo meme stock. I think this could be detrimental to the stock in the long run. If Intel stock keeps running up based on hype I think we will see a major retraction in the price in correlation with a market event. This type of fall will stunt intel’s long term growth due to investor fear of a repeat. Maybe even killing the company in the process. The question that I have is does my analysis make sense? I am still on the fence about investing in the company right now.

T,1obwk6s,financialindependence,Early-career crossroad: stay with a flexible consulting role or go all-in on a pre-IPO tech startup?,"Hi all, grateful for any thoughtful takes here. Context: I’m a pretty high-achieving person (or at least want to be). I’ve intentionally spent my 20s focused on financial and career progress... not much travel and rarely buy new things. My mid-term goal (next 10 years) is freedom: to never *have* to be always working, but to choose when and how I do. I want to be respected enough to work on projects I actually care about, and have the financial stability to say no when I need to. And then when I am working, not be working for someone else. I want to do 10am workout classes if I want, etc. I live simple regardless of money; outdoorsy, not a big consumer... and I’d feel “set” with about $1.5M in the bank at the end of the day (10-15 years from now). Not here to debate that number, there is so much more to it (family money incoming one day, etc), just sharing for context. **The situation:** I currently work for a very small consulting firm. My former leader brought me in as a sort-of informal partner... we split everything 60/40. The work is part-time due to lack of work (around 15–20 hours/week), and I’m not salaried, we just split all the work (I am VERY lucky, she is a great leader and the reason we have the good work we have is because of her). I’ll earn about $95K pre-tax this year (2025). On top of that, some assignments have potential upside, like commissions, that could be anywhere from $30K to $200K, depending on the outcome and timeline (could take 8 months to 2 years). So it’s not guaranteed, but the potential is *huge*. The work is flexible, meaningful, and I get a ton of autonomy. I am building my name and learning a lot. Basically my dream setup. But the pipeline of new work isn’t always consistent, and I’ve started wondering if I should be doing more to maximize my time and income. The other opportunity: About six months ago, a friend asked if I could help his tech company with events and operations. It’s not my main field, but I’m competent and said yes on a part-time basis. It pays $40/hr, remote, and informal (I’ve been wearing a lot of hats). At first I thought it was just side income, but the more I’ve learned about the company, the more interesting it’s become. It’s a well-known pre-IPO brand with real potential. If I leaned in, I think I could eventually earn equity or stock options. The downside: big startup energy. Long hours, high stress, constant pace. I am protected from this since I am not a full time employee right now, but if I went all-in, I’d lose a lot of the flexibility I currently have. **The decision:** Right now, I’m doing both. * **Job A (consulting):** life/work balance, flexible, uncertain upside but long-term dream life potential. * **Job B (tech startup):** high intensity, likely faster upside, more predictable path to big equity if it hits. I wouldn’t walk away from Job A unless I had equity *in writing*. But I keep questioning myself... am I being greedy by wanting more when I already have freedom most people dream of? Or lazy for not wanting to grind harder while I’m young (aka give up the flexibility), when the payoff could accelerate everything? **TL;DR:** Currently making \~$95K/yr working 15–20 hrs/week at a consulting firm with big upside potential but inconsistent work. Also doing part-time operations work for a pre-IPO tech company that could lead to equity but demands much more time. Torn between keeping my flexible “dream life” or pushing harder for faster wealth. Am I being short-sighted, greedy, or lazy?",0,16,2025-10-20 22:56:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1obwk6s/earlycareer_crossroad_stay_with_a_flexible/,2025-10-23 09:08:35.599648,0.35,$T,0.5,[],"['ipo', 'split']",0.7114285714285714

T,1nv985m,stocks,Cidara ($CDTX): Why 75% Probability of Success for Cidara’s Universal Flu Prophylaxis CD388 Is a Conservative Anchor for Valuation,"**TL;DR:** Many Phase 3 programs are treated like a 50/50 coin toss by investors in terms of probability of success. Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%. **Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice. In my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/) I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out. That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today: **1) The dataset is unusually large and robust** Many Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season. At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p<0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3. **2) The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith** Plenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities. **3) Safety looks clean so far** In NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo. **4) FDA has signaled confidence** The FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need. **5) A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug** The 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts. **While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \*conservative\*.** The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t. It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development. Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case. **TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence, which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model. I’ll be following up with a separate post to update my **valuation analysis** now that FDA minutes have confirmed the Phase 3 plan and expanded TAM to include all adults over 65.",7,8,2025-10-01 14:09:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/,2025-10-23 09:07:08.961891,0.35,$T,0.9,['CDTX'],['support'],0.7057142857142856

So the more taxable income you have, the more the tax burden is on long term capital gains, up to a certain percentage (~37%). That said, borrowing against said portfolio comes with interest, slightly higher than a normal 30 yr, but without paying taxes on the sale. Either loan option though, your left paying interest vs cash up front. Question - how does it actually benefit you to borrow against your assets if you don’t have an income?

One section talks about the factors that drive stock prices. Graham breaks them down into three categories: * **Market factors** * **Future value factors** * **Intrinsic value factors** These factors not only influence the bids and offers in the market (which ultimately set the price), but also serve as the line between *speculating* and *investing*, depending on which factors you choose to focus on.

T,1nz6nc6,financialindependence,Trying to choose between maxing out retirement accounts or buying rental properties to achieve FIRE,"I’m 25 and recently bought my first home, which I live in. I make a bit over six figures and have been debating what the smartest path toward early retirement is: maxing out my 401(k) and IRA every year or focusing on buying rental properties. My original plan was to save for my next home, but after running some numbers, the current high interest rates make it hard to find anything that cash flows well or shows strong returns. The main upside would be long-term appreciation since I’d likely buy in an area that’s expected to grow faster than average. Now I’m wondering if it makes more sense to focus on maxing my retirement accounts instead since the returns might be more reliable. The downside is that if I put the majority of my savings into retirement accounts, I’ll lose access to that capital and won’t be able to invest it into real estate opportunities for a while.

One kid with nanny 3–4 days/week, the other in daycare. **Household income:** \~$500K from employment (my part is about half) **My financial situation (\~$7M, largely inherited):** * $2M in rental real estate (150k gross income per year) * $2M equity in primary home (+$1M mortgage @ 1.5%) * $3M in equities * $1M in cash **Wife’s assets:** \~$800K in stocks + 1 rental property (65% mortgage remaining). **Good to know:** We have a prenup, I'm paying for most of our cost of living (around 150k annually + 100k in taxes) **Location:** MCOL/HCOL area, plan to stay. **What’s on my mind:** 1.

Yet here in r/financialindependence most retirement questions I see involve tax planning for $1M, $2M, or more in savings. So my question is: **what about the retirees with $250k–$500k saved?** Based on the Fed data, that should be the majority. Take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) as an example: * With $250k saved, your first required distribution at age 73 is around $9,500. * Most people at that level are going to withdraw at least that much anyway just to cover expenses. * And with today’s standard deduction ($29,200 for married couples), a household with mainly Social Security income probably pays little or no tax on that RMD.

T,1nr23ui,stocks,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.** It’s a short-term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you. Trading influencers will also love it. I’m not being cynical; I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call. Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post addresses key nuances in the argument for and against PDT’s removal. # Here’s my main point: A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability. The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media-influenced. **The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.** [Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/kcs82kp7lirf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91d791d95838ed0c5f53d63cdb09b3011823e85) # Addressing Surface-Level Nuances A trader had said, “People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.” This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market. Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule). This trader had also said, “There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.” For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.** # Nuance 1: The Main Narrative “What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.” I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics. # Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market. Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco. It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation. **Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.** The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail. # Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade? That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money. I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience. A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability. The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced. # Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000 If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in. **Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks** The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions. **Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule** Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way. It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk. The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms. In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional. People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone. **Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.** I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new. If people margin trade with purpose and understand it, e.g., futures and options, it’s fine, but margin trading stocks can be oversimplified, and risks can be played down. If people aimlessly use margin, there will be unnecessary liquidations. # Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now! This isn’t true, and it’s a short-term trend; anecdotes that don't hold weight, it's a trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable. [Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176) # Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor. Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account. # Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning. Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors. **Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.** That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit **Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.** Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations. # Ending / Agenda For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate. **If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?** I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs. I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest. **Lobbyists make the call.** # This is about enriching institutions, not you.

Central banks and ETFs have also been buying up physical silver pretty quietly, which adds a bit of backbone to the rally instead of just retail hype.

T,1o61ebg,ValueInvesting,"Assessing Management Quality: Beyond Vibes, Handshakes, and Governance Checklists","Buffett has always said that management's skill in allocating capital has an enormous impact on enterprise value. Greenblatt put it even more simply: if management has been a good allocator of capital, assume they'll keep doing that. Yet when I look at how most investors actually evaluate management, it's still governance checklists and gut feel from a couple meetings per year. It's subjective, hard to scale, and honestly not that useful. I've spent the last few years trying to build something more systematic. Here's what I've landed on: **1. Capital Allocation Discipline** Don't just look at whether the ROIC was good. Look at what management said when they made the decision. What opportunities did they see? What trade-offs did they talk about? What did they say success would look like? This tells you about their judgment before you know the outcome. And when you track this over multiple decisions, patterns become obvious. Some teams have a real framework. Others are just winging it and cleaning up the story later. **2. Forecasting Accuracy** Everyone analyzes official guidance. That's commoditized. The signal is in the operational stuff executives say in calls and presentations. ""We expect production volumes to hit X by Q3."" ""Customer adoption is tracking ahead of plan."" ""The regulatory approval should come through in the next 60 days."" They make these statements all the time, and they're way less hedged than the official numbers. Track whether they actually deliver on them. Some management teams consistently hit what they say. Others are constantly revising. There's research on this (Baik, Farber, and Lee 2011) showing that managers who forecast accurately actually run better businesses and their stocks outperform. **3. Strategic Execution** Talk is cheap. Everyone has a strategy. The question is whether they actually deliver on it. Track the initiatives they announce. New products. Market expansions. Cost savings programs. Whatever they're telling investors they're going to do. Then track whether they actually do it on the timeline they said. Persistent slippage tells you something about planning and organizational capability. Some teams consistently deliver. Others consistently don't. Kaplan's research found execution skills are one of the most predictive traits for returns. Makes sense when you think about it. **4. Communication Transparency** Watch how management communicates when things go well versus when they don't. Does the story change every quarter to match the results? Or is the messaging pretty consistent? Good teams tell you what's working and what's not. They explain variances clearly. Bad teams spin everything. Good quarters are because of brilliant strategy. Bad quarters are because of external factors nobody could have predicted. You can feel this when you read transcripts over time. Some CEOs just sound more credible than others. The trick is measuring it systematically instead of relying on feel. **Why This Actually Matters** The academic work here is pretty clear. Bertrand and Schoar showed back in 2003 that individual managers leave persistent fingerprints on how companies operate. More recent work (Bennedsen 2020) shows managerial ability explains a huge chunk of performance differences, even after you control for industry and everything else. Two companies with identical balance sheets can produce completely different returns based on who's running them. Yet management evaluation is still one of the least systematic parts of most investment processes. The hard part is moving from ""I got a good vibe from the CEO"" to actual data you can point to. **What I'm Not Including** Governance checklists are fine but they're table stakes. Everyone has independent boards and compensation committees. That doesn't tell you who's actually good at capital allocation. And I've learned not to trust my impressions from meetings. You see a CEO maybe six times a year if you're lucky. That's not enough data to judge someone. Plus you're probably just reacting to how polished their presentation is, which tells you nothing about judgment. **Looking for Feedback** I'd love to hear from folks here: * What am I missing in this framework? * How do you evaluate management today? * What patterns have you noticed in your own holdings about what separates good management from bad? I wrote up the full framework with all the research and details here: [https://www.marvin-labs.com/blog/evaluating-management-quality/](https://www.marvin-labs.com/blog/evaluating-management-quality/)",5,4,2025-10-14 00:43:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o61ebg/assessing_management_quality_beyond_vibes/,2025-10-23 09:08:12.044442,0.35,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'volume']",0.6114285714285714
T,1o4iq4i,ValueInvesting,Please criticize my Investment Thesis on Slide,"Maybe you will change my mind and save my money or I will change yours and make you money. Slide is a young Florida based home insurer (founded 2022) focusing on coastal properties which is a niche most large insurers have abandoned due to high hurricane and regulatory risk (Assignement of Benefit and one-way fees in courts, I can expand on this in the comments). They’re leveraging proprietary risk-modelling tech and data-driven underwriting to profitably insure where others won’t. The good: • Massive market opportunity: Citizens (state-backed insurer) is offloading policies, and looks like Slide is cherry-picking the most profitable ones so far (190k expected in 2025). Citizens sold 678k policies since January 2024 and have 772k outstanding yet to sell as of August 2025, so looks like this can last roughly 2 more years. • Rapid growth: revenue jumped from $242M in 2022 → $847M in 2024 while cutting the combined ratio from 90% → 79% → 72%, far below peers like HCI (83%) and Heritage (94%). • Structural tailwind: Florida’s post-2022 regulatory clean-up fixed issues like “assignment of benefit” abuse that bankrupted 11 insurers in 5 years before 2022 which makes Slide benefit from first mover advantage. The bad / risks: • Very young company (although the founder-CEO was a co-founder and CEO of Heritage Insurance before) • CEO and wife control over 51% of shares and 45% of votes which could create investor-management conflicts of interest. • 145 BBB complaints in 3 years and 82 in the last 12 months~10x higher than competition, so could be possible that their combined ratio is from aggressive claims handling and not from some wonderful modelling capabilities. • Sensitive to reinsurance pricing spikes after hurricanes (industry specific risk, not company specific) Valuation methodology I used: DCF with perpetuity 2% (Assumption for FCF increasing in line with inflation at mature state of the company) For revenue growth and FCF margin as of percentage of Revenue I used: 20% and 62% for 2026, 15% and 60% for 2027, 11% and 58% for 2028. Then I used 5% FCF growth for 7 more years to get 10 year forecast in total before applying perpetuity.

T,1o8tsey,financialindependence,DF Optional FI calculator - Feedback requested,"Hey all, I'd love for you to take a look at a calculator I built and let me know if you find it useful and if there are any issues. **Background:** I've never been much of a FIRE person myself. On the whole I've stayed away from sacrificing my now for a nebulous potential future. I did what I considered responsible (401(k) matching, etc), but didn't make big bets. But I'm also a big proponent for knowing when is ""enough"". I recently did the math, and discovered that ""enough"" was a lot closer than I expected. I'm 38, and from what I'm seeing retirement at age 45 as difficult but achievable, while retirement at 50 is a no-brainer. That's assuming the standard 7% nominal growth, 4% SWR, etc. and also comfortable with returning to the workforce to fund my excess and so on. I'm not aiming to fully stop working, I just want to no longer be \_coerced\_ to work. **The tool:** Part of ""doing the math"" meant building out a good Desmos calculator to find when my savings growth was likely to hit my savings targets. So that's what I built and that's what I'm asking y'all to take a look at. I've done what I can to validate the underlying math (both using my own education as well as leveraging some AI tools to check my math). But there's no substitute for more eyeballs. The tool shows 3 targets, all in real dollars (i.e. adjusted for inflation): * **The Fat target:** Treats mortgage as part of normal expenses (i.e., portfolio covers P&I and PTI via withdrawals). * **The Lean/Debt-free target:** Discounts expenses by the mortgage P&I, assuming the home is fully paid off. * **The Hybrid target (the one I'm targeting):** The debt-free target + the remaining principal on the mortgage (discounted for inflation). This is the target where you *could* pay off the mortgage and still cover all expenses, but allows you to keep arbitrage between your investments and the mortgage. The tool allows for a ""coast"" period, where no further savings contributions are made, but no withdrawal is made either. **Nitty details:** * ~~Tax drag on withdrawals isn’t explicitly modeled here and would be covered under “expenses.”~~ Edit: a term for this has been added. * This is all estimates, so fine-grained detail isn’t the goal. That’s why specific tax liability was left out. But anything that would cause it to scale differently should be called out. * This is intended to give an overall timeline, not determine whether you're currently \_at\_ a phase transition point. This expects that it's a long enough timeline for highs and lows to cancel out, but for actually making the jump you need to be prepared for things like sequence of returns risk. It *can* be useful for figuring out if you're close enough that you should start preparing, though (e.g. by starting the Roth Conversion Ladder if that's part of your tax strategy). **The request:** Please poke holes in this. I did my best to document what each variable means, but I might be using some nonstandard notation. The formulas will be close to textbook form, but might have common factors cancelled out and simplified. Double check that the formulas I'm using are sound and appropriate for their use. At this point I don't think it's safe to use until folks have properly reviewed it, but if it checks out I think it's something people might find useful. For me, personally, knowing the number I needed to save caused my eyes to glaze over. But seeing ""8 years"" made it more real for me. Note: in the link I'm providing I've obscured my actual numbers, so don't take this as an analysis of my actual situation. Original: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6brcerquy6](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6brcerquy6) Edited: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/suc6nuy9zr](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/suc6nuy9zr) * Cleaned up some of the slider ranges and added a few extra notes. * Added labels to target lines. * Added t\_eff for the effective tax rate of withdrawals, with a default value of 15%. F\_F and F\_DF now include a term of (1 - t\_eff) in their denominator (this also impacts F\_H). This adjusts the target portfolio size upward to account for tax drag.",1,5,2025-10-17 06:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1o8tsey/df_optional_fi_calculator_feedback_requested/,2025-10-23 09:08:35.601865,0.35,$T,0.5,[],[],0.6

The OpenAI team says talks are underway with hundreds of infrastructure providers across North America, but there are no firm answers yet. The U.S. grid is already strained, gas turbines are sold out through 2028, nuclear is slow to deploy, and renewables are tied up in political roadblocks.” I check this sub (and other stock ones) a fair amount but I always see one common theme: nuclear. The main concern there is how long it takes for those power plants to build. We can’t wait a decade. I’ve looked into solar and natural gas as well.

T,1o6fxae,investing,How I learned that efficiency can matter more than growth,"Over the past couple of years, I’ve started to realize that growth on its own doesn’t mean much if the foundation isn’t solid. I work at a company with around 300 employees, and last year things started to fall apart a bit not because revenue was down, but because operations were messy. We had too many tools, overlapping software subscriptions, and no clear view of where the money was actually going. It was frustrating because on paper everything looked good, but cash flow always felt tight. Projects got delayed, invoices went missing, and departments started pointing fingers. Eventually we had to slow down, take a step back, and focus on structure instead of expansion. We started tracking spending more closely, consolidating systems, and making accountability a daily habit. It’s not as exciting as talking about returns or stock picks, but that shift completely changed how I think about investing too. I used to focus on finding the next opportunity now I’m more interested in how efficiently each dollar is being used. Efficiency quietly compounds the same way returns do.",218,13,2025-10-14 13:45:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6fxae/how_i_learned_that_efficiency_can_matter_more/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.471436,0.3,$T,0.8,[],['revenue'],1.0
T,1o3y904,investing,When Your Investments Outperform Your Salary: Staying Motivated at Work,"I’ve been thinking about something lately and wanted to share it here, maybe some of you can relate. I’ve noticed that my motivation at work has dropped since my investments, mainly in ETFs and stocks, started performing better than my monthly salary. For example, if I earn around €3,000 a month, but my portfolio grows by €6,000 in the same period, it’s natural to feel more excited about that growth than about my paycheck. At the same time, I catch myself constantly checking market updates on my phone during the day. Since I invest regularly, I often open my investment apps to see how things are going which definitely distracts me from my work. Of course, I know that a stable salary is essential for everyday life paying rent, bills, and living expenses. Still, I can’t help but feel that when investment returns outpace my income, it becomes harder to stay motivated at my job. I also realize this view is somewhat biased. When the markets are strong, it’s easy to focus on the gains and feel less excited about work. But during downturns, I naturally appreciate the security of my regular paycheck more. It’s a cycle. Yet in a bull market, my attention and energy tend to shift toward my investments. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How do you stay motivated at work when your investments start to outperform your salary?

T,1o0dwu9,financialindependence,"3 Years, $20K Saved — So I'm Changing My Entire Career to Reach FI","Hi everyone, I’ve been following this community for a while but this is my first post. I wanted to share my current situation and get some perspective or advice from people who’ve been through similar transitions. I’m 27 years old, living in Turkey, and working as a mechanical engineer. I try to had two jobs — my main one as an Engineer and a part-time remote role at consumer department. Despite all that effort, after three years in the field I’ve managed to save only around $20,000. Mechanical engineering unfortunately doesn’t have the same financial value here as it does in other countries. Even with long hours, technical expertise, and leadership responsibilities, the income barely keeps up with inflation or housing costs. It’s been discouraging to realize that working harder in this field doesn’t really change the outcome financially. That’s why I’m planning a career shift: becoming a merchant marine officer (engineer officer at sea). It’s a tough and risky profession, but the financial upside is significant. After completing the necessary certifications, the career path looks like this: \* Trainee:\*\* \~$500/month \* 4th Engineer:\*\* \~$4,000/month \* 3rd Engineer:\*\* \~$6,000/month \* 2nd Engineer:\*\* \~$9,000/month \* Chief Engineer:\*\* \~$12,000/month Having to be a compulsory 6-month intern after this age is also one of the annoying points, but I see it as an investment. Each rank usually works 9 months per year, so even at mid-level positions, the annual income can easily reach $40K–$90K, and later on $150K+. With that income and a frugal lifestyle, I could finally reach a sustainable level of financial independence instead of constantly chasing stability. I don’t dream of luxury — just being able to live normally, save consistently, and eventually build a portfolio that works for me. My long-term goal is to grow my capital through investments and small ventures, eventually becoming financially independent within the next 10 years. Has anyone here made a similar high-risk, high-reward career change to accelerate their path to FI? Any advice for maintaining discipline while working away from home for long periods would also be great.

Basically, the market’s showing that fundamentals are what really drive stock moves right now. To back this up, they used a model looking at things like free cash flow yield, ROE, and new orders to estimate the chances of big moves. The results suggest the market might be underestimating potential swings, both up and down. They also highlighted 25 specific opportunities—20 bullish names like Disney, Citi, Broadcom, Microchip, and 5 bearish ones like MGM, Enphase, AMD. Goldman points out that the mispricing in options could create opportunities, but it’s risky and speculative, and not for someone who doesn’t understand options. The main takeaway? Long-term investing still comes down to fundamentals.

T,1o7177q,stocks,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company. For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company. I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade. Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone. But their moat is not actively growing. I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason. The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024. iPad: $26.69 B iPhone: $201.18 B Mac: $29.98 B Service: $96.17 B Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B (2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone. That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV). iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful. Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim. It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary. In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to. I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.

New visa changes are also a positive for them. Should make a big recovery with IT spend set to increase again. **UPST (Upstart):** AI driven lending platform – improving credit performance, potential profitability inflection. Lowering interest rate environment very good for them too. **VLN (Valens Semiconductor):** High speed connectivity chips for autos & industrial – benefits from EV and ADAS adoption.

Despite negative cash flow and a significant debt, their latest Q2 2025 results proved impressive with 90% of their debt reduced and cash flow improved. Their book:bill ratio is also much better than before. All signs point to a full recovery if they stay on track. The low volume shows that it is not very well known right now for investment purposes. You can’t find people talking about ATOS on any social media. You search the news on Google and there’s, what, 1 article per week? The market cap used to be ~€11B. Sure, the company has sold some assets and scaled down in some areas, but they are expanding in others, and the industry they are in is becoming more and more prominent.

T,1nvhekh,ValueInvesting,Upstart looking good,"They have about a 12.5 percent dilution risk and I believe that’s why they are trading low right now. With some reverse cash flows, the base case fair value of upstart (high probability catalysts only) winds up at $80 by 2027. Then considering the dilution from the 560 million in convertible notes at $55 (that’s your 12.5 percent). … basically, I bought a couple $55 January 2027 leaps that should let me ride it up over the next six months and cash out while (theoretically) we get another rate reduction or two, their expansion into the HELOC market continues, and people start to see ai underwriting actually does a better job at avoiding delinquency than the straight FICO system we use today. My really dumbed down thesis: People are still afraid of ai underwriting when they shouldn’t be, and as their revenue CAGR continues to accelerate that fear will diminish. Upcoming rate cuts (including the recent rate cut) will provide fuel for their fire. Market expansion will continue, global expansion is inevitable. Edit: I should add the conversion notes @ about 35 bucks for around 600 million, so the total dilution is around thirty percent but that $80 per share forecast includes it.

T,1nomhws,investing,Sam Altman's new blog post - who are the infra partners he's alluding to?,"Sama rarely blogs but he just posted this one: [https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence](https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence) Key sentences: * ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week."" * ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics."" * ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide."" * ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality."" Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas: * **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power.

I believe our investments are spread widely between stocks bonds mutual funds a small portion liquid in more of a money market etc. We pay our FA between $25-30k a year. He does a good job.. I just don’t like the guy. Do I just find a new FA and transfer the fiduciary rights over to him? Does the new person have to also use fidelity to house their funds? Or do I have to cash out everything and then reinvest (which obviously can’t happen due to capital gains tax)?

No withdrawals from any accounts. - I have 1 large 401k and 3 smaller 401ks from past jobs. (I have brokerage accounts, unrelated to this situation) Am I correct: - I can rollover the old 401ks to a Roth IRA without doing a backdoor Roth in this situation - There is no limit to the amount i can rollover unlike normal annual contributions to an IRA - This is a taxable event (pre tax to after tax) - Therefore I should wait to rollover until I move to that lower income job in 3-4 years and my tax rate is lower. - The 5-year rule applies. I will be 55 at that point. - There is no limit to what i can withdraw at 5 years except the amount i contributed. I wouldn’t plan to withdraw it all but just thinking ahead for all situations.

The company spun off the operations to a shell and here we are. Market Cap is $26M after dilution, there’s 8M in cash. Newtek bank retained a $5M earnout that we may have to pay out over the next 24 months. This earnout is somewhat but not wholly offset by earnouts from our legacy business. The company does ~25M in sales yearly at a 50% gross margin. Operating margin is near breakeven, so the company doesn’t make money currently, but has favorable unit economics if management can grow revenues. It’s important to note that the company is trading at 1x sales. So valuation could 3-4x on that basis. Customers are small business owners. Finally, there’s the margin of safety: the company may be free. There’s an IP lawsuit that the company won against Cisco for $65M. The post trial wrangling is going back and forth, but we shall see.

T,1nx45ob,stocks,Newish investor - should I worry?,"Was skimming through the CNBC news app and read this fear mongering article (can’t post attachments so will copy paste some parts): - “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday. Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names. Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks: Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner. Many investors assume investing in the S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said. If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur. But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%. Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future. Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback. Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies. Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks. That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k. With a good amount of money in there now, this article just worried me. What you guys think, is this still the strategy ? Are they just fear mongering?",0,21,2025-10-03 16:38:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nx45ob/newish_investor_should_i_worry/,2025-10-23 09:07:06.904709,0.3,$T,0.9,[],"['rally', 'split']",0.7114285714285714

T,1nvegky,investing,How do you weight your investments?,"I know some would say that you only need a handful of successful stocks to invest in but I’m not Warren Buffett and I feel more comfortable diversifying. Little by little I’ve picked up stocks that gave me some satisfaction and a few I’m speculating on. The main sectors, without going too much into the weeds, are Semiconductors, Electronics, Mining, Aerospace and Defense, Energy, Electric vehicles, Robotics, Healthcare and some more but these are the main ones I’d say. Overall I’ve ended up with 150 names that I’ll probably trim down by a 1/3 in the next few months depending on performance, future prospects and overall how I’m convinced by them. The thing is I don’t have a simple method to weight them . It definitely would not make much sense to have equal weights. Market cap could be an option, investing more in bigger and more solid companies and less in the rest… but they are overall all quite big. P/E ratio is interesting too but I don’t think one should invest more in a company just because it seems undervalued. EPS is another metric I think should be taken into consideration but again can’t be the main one right? Do you have a “simple” rule you follow to weight your stocks ? At this point I’m actually thinking of looking into the detail of an All World ETF and just adjust what I have according to the weights of the etf….",1,16,2025-10-01 17:23:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nvegky/how_do_you_weight_your_investments/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.306032,0.3,$T,0.8,[],"['market cap', 'eps']",0.7114285714285714

One can grow 40% a year for 10 years, and one can grow 3% a year for 10 years. Which is worth more today? Of course the 40% grower. You evaluate them the same way. Every investment is the present value of all future cash flow. For a company that has fast growth, that value is much higher today than a company that has low growth.

T,1o8q50l,ValueInvesting,What do you think?,"My High-Conviction Deep-Tech Portfolio — Betting on Hydrogen, Batteries, Robotics, and AI Hardware (Would Love Serious Opinions) Hey everyone, I wanted to share my current portfolio and get your views on whether I’m positioned in the right industries for the next 3–5 years. I know it looks risky, but I’ve been intentionally building exposure to what I believe are the foundation layers of the future industrial economy — power, storage, robotics, and autonomous systems. My portfolio right now: • PLUG (Plug Power) – 5,000 shares – Hydrogen / Clean Energy – around $18,600 value • DFLI (Dragonfly Energy) – 12,000 shares – Battery Storage – around $16,200 value • ARBE (Arbe Robotics) – 7,800 shares – 4D Radar / Autonomous Tech – around $17,700 value • RR (Richtech Robotics) – 2,950 shares – Robotics / Automation – around $16,700 value Total portfolio size is roughly $69,000 USD. My Thesis I’m betting on industries that sit underneath the AI and electrification boom — the physical enablers of the next decade. • Hydrogen & clean energy (PLUG): The world’s transition to energy independence will need hydrogen and fuel-cell infrastructure. • Battery storage (DFLI): Without large-scale storage, renewable energy grids can’t function efficiently. • Autonomous radar (ARBE): 4D imaging radar is essential for next-gen mobility, defense, and robotics. • Service & industrial robotics (RR): Labor shortages and rising automation will make robotics mainstream across logistics, retail, and hospitality. In short, I call my setup the “Power + Brain + Body” triangle: – Power (PLUG & DFLI) fuels and stores energy. – Brain (ARBE) gives machines perception. – Body (RR) executes automation in the physical world. I Know It’s Risky These are small-cap, high-volatility names with dilution and cash-burn risks. I’m fully aware that the short term will be rough. But historically, innovation sectors rebound the hardest after macro crises. Governments eventually fund energy, AI, and robotics to drive productivity again. I’m okay being early — I just don’t want to be wrong. My Three-Year Outlook (Base Case) If these industries evolve the way I expect, I see roughly 130–180% upside across most of these names over the next three years. In numbers, that would put my portfolio somewhere around $170K in a normal recovery and possibly $220–250K in a strong bull cycle. In a worst-case macro crisis, it could fall to around $25K, but innovation usually comes back first. What I’d Like To Hear From You • Am I positioned in the right sectors for the next industrial/AI cycle? • Are these companies just too early, or does patience pay off? • What would you diversify into without killing the deep-tech theme? I’m not here to pump anything — I just want honest takes from experienced investors who’ve lived through past market cycles and understand how early-stage industries move. Appreciate any input, bullish or bearish. I’m here to learn and refine my conviction before 2026 hits.

T,1odd14x,investing,I am at a loss. Want to start LP and get on with my life but need serious actionable advice.,"Advice on starting a business I want to start a hedge fund but do not have the capital required. I will provide some background about myself, why I want to start a fund, and the trouble I am encountering. If anyone could assist, it would take a huge load off my shoulders. First, I am in my late 20’s and have worked as a trader at a bank for the past three years. We are only a clearing firm and I took this job so I could watch institutional equity and fixed income trading activity. The result was fruitful. Over that period, I developed some multi asset strategies that blow every retail product and mutual I have seen out of the water. As an example, I run a couple of portfolios myself and for my family, I’ve been running a custom multi asset strat that is up 43% this year with an R squared of 0.1. Second, the problem is capital. Even averaging 50% returns would take years of my life starting with such a small sum of money that I have. I have developed unique tools and strategies, but don’t have the capital for it to be immediately life changing, and need to find capital somehow someway. Third, if someone could help set me on the right path at all, in terms of who to speak with to raise starting capital for an LP, it will save me my beautiful hairline and likely thousands of hours of lost time with my family in the long run.

T,1o779tq,investing,How does your portfolio size dictate asset allocation?,"Hi, being in my late fourties I'm sitting around 50/50 stock-bond split. But as my investment portfolio grows, so are my doubts whether that still makes sense :-) The way I see it, bonds serve two main purposes: 1. to cushion the psychological blow when markets tank, 2. to reduce Sequence of Returns Risk once regular withdrawals start. When we begin our journey, say with $10k or even $100k, point #1 matters more. The portfolio isn’t big enough for withdrawal plans yet, so staying sane through volatility is key. But things change once the portfolio hits \~$1M+. At that point, half in bonds (\~$500k) might be enough to cover several years of living expenses during a downturn, taking care of #2 (heavily depending on our lifestyle and where we live ofc, a different discussion). So if market drawdowns don’t shake you anymore and you’ve built the bond safety net, what’s the point of keeping a fixed 50/50 - wouldn’t it make sense to lean more heavily into stocks after a certain point?

My current thoughts are that the S&P 500 is turning into a massive bubble being held up by a few of the biggest AI companies who are bleeding money year on year with essentially no hope of ever getting returns to offset how much they have invested into AI. Nvidia is making massive investments (billions of dollars) seemingly everywhere, encouraging companies to build data centres packed with their GPUs. To me, this doesn’t seem sustainable. It feels like the market is treating these companies as if they’ve discovered an infinite money glitch, with valuations climbing endlessly. But unless someone figures out how to generate truly massive revenue from AI in the near future, I don’t see how this can continue. Therefore I want to take my money out of the S&P 500 soon and store it in gold as a stable asset that I believe will continue to rise in value as people look to store there money in safer assets.

T,1nphxtz,ValueInvesting,Advice starting a stock portfolio for my soon to be grandson,"I am a single father. I got full custody of my son around 6 months of age. He is now 22. His fiance is pregnant with their first child. A baby boy so I am a grandfather at the age of 43. I would like to do something to give my grandson a little head start when he gets older. I would like to open a stock portfolio for him now. He will be born in March. Then, let it grown until he is about 30 years of age or so. I figure by that time he will have completed college. Be settled into a career and possibly be settled down a little. I tried investing in bitcoin and the stock market years ago. I picked the wrong time to do it. It turned out to be right before COVID and it was all bad. I lost a good bit of money. I contribute a good bit of it to not knowing what the hell I was doing too. Now I have been doing a lot of reading and research. I started a little project since then where I invested a little money to get my feet wet and was able to do pretty good. Therefore, I would like to start another project for my grandson. I did pretty good with a little small portfolio I put together for practice. Just a couple hundred bucks to get my feet wet. I basically just picked stocks from companies whose products I use and know about. I work in computer repair so most of the stocks were technology stocks. I know about diversifying your portfolio. That ETFs are more conservative where individual companies is more risky. So I know the basics which is why I am asking for help and advice. My question is if I do something like I just did where I start a small portfolio. Say maybe $500 to start. Then, if I add a little money to it monthly (maybe over time other family members with pitch in) do you think I could grow it into something decent by age 30 or so? This is an amount of money I wouldn’t be upset with if I was to lose it all as long as I have a really decent shot at successfully completing the mission. Would it be better to maybe split the money between two portfolios? One conservative and one pretty aggressive? What would be a good strategy to go about this? Like I said I am a single parent. I am far from well off. I wish I had thousands I could have smartly invested. However, that is not the reality, and I want to leave my grandchild SOMETHING. Can you guys and gals please offer me some advice? I would extremely greatly appreciate it!

T,1o2xukt,investing,Opinions on investment mix for newly retired.,"Trying this again since my previous post was too fund-specific. Retired a little under three years ago, and was hoping to get some (constructive) opinions on my current account diversification. I am of the opinion that the market is due for a sizable correction that will lead to a stagflation scenario. To that end I diversified seven months ago into a “first step” mix that I think will, with further adjustments, stand up in that future scenario. I have one year’s worth of expenses in a HYSA separately. I pull mainly from Roth contributions and 457b currently. The percentages are a bit wonky; I haven’t rebalanced yet. Can I get your take on it’s current state? Top Level: 84% Equity, 8% Bonds, 5% Cash, 3% Gold ROTH: 82% Equity, 12% Bonds, 6% Gold. 60% Domestic, 20% Int’l, 20% Global. 63% LC, 2% MC, 10% SC, 7% EM, 12% Fixed, 6% Other. 71% Blend, 5% Value, 6% Growth, 12% Bond, 6% Other. Bonds 58% Mixed, 42% Treasury IRA: 77% Equity, 17% Bonds, 6% Gold. 72% Domestic, 22% Int’l, 6% Global. 60% LC, 5% MC, 6% SC, 6% EM, 17% Fixed, 6% Other. 53% Blend, 9% Value, 10% Sector, 5% Growth, 17% Bond, 6% Other.

T,1o2fjyg,investing,Would a market crash after a hypothetical AI bubble matter long-term for ETF investors?,"I’m not an expert, so everything I’m saying could be wrong, but I’ve been thinking about the following. Let’s say (hypothetically) that the current excitement around AI turned out to be a bubble and caused a market crash later on. If bubbles are basically misallocations of capital that eventually get corrected after a crash, wouldn’t the total market value eventually return to what it was before, just in a more balanced state with money redistributed more efficiently? If that’s true, would it really make a difference to invest, say 50€/month before and 150€/month after the crash, versus just continuously investing 100€/month, assuming you have a well-diversified ETF portfolio and are *not* saving not-invested money to invest later?

T,1nqfbgz,investing,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example. There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside… According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks. Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks. So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey? And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return. https://testfol.io/?s=j86M1wQwMgN",2,6,2025-09-25 18:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqfbgz/why_do_we_insist_on_crp_when_there_is_none/,2025-10-23 09:07:30.327976,0.3,$T,0.8,[],[],0.7

Everyone says to invest in index ETFs because they’re “safe” — but have you seen what’s happening right now with tech stocks? The explosion in a few mega-cap names is wild. Traditional market-cap weighted ETFs (like the S&P 500) give huge influence to the biggest companies, so when tech rallies hard, the whole index becomes overly concentrated. That’s not exactly diversification anymore. Wouldn’t it make more sense now to look at equal-weighted ETFs, where every company gets the same importance in the portfolio? That way, you’re not just betting on five or six tech giants — you’re spreading exposure more evenly and building a basket that actually represents the broader market.

T,1o9irar,investing,Calculating Risk-Free Rate and Cost of Debt using Risk-Free Rate and Default Speads: problem,"Let's say that we are trying to esimate US Risk-Free Rate and Cost of Debt for US company using these inputs: US T-Bond Rate: 4.00% US Default Spread: 0.25% Company Default Spread: 1.00% . Now, when we look at the formulas there are these: RfR = 10yr Bond Rate - US Default Spread = 4.00% - 0.25% = 3.75% . But there are two formulas for Cost of Debt, one is using Country Default Spread and other is not. Which one should I use for this exact scenario: 1. Cost of Debt = RfR + Default Spread(Country) + Default Spread(Company) = 3.75% + 0.25% + 1.00% = 5.00% 2. Cost of Debt = RfR + Default Spread(Company) = 3.75% + 1.00% = 4.75% . Note that I've cleansed RfR from US Default Spread, so I'm wonderind should I add it back or not when calculating Cost of Debt. On one hand it might seem that adding it back could be considered double-counting but if done other way, then US Default Spread is completely omitted. . And to expand double-counting question, do individual companies Default Spreads based on agency ratings include country specific Default Spreads or are they purely related to companies? . P.S. It doesn't need to be specifically US company, could be any company using aprioriate Bond Rates and Spreads for it's region - the question is about proper method and formula not particular case.",1,1,2025-10-18 01:15:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o9irar/calculating_riskfree_rate_and_cost_of_debt_using/,2025-10-23 09:07:28.462896,0.3,$T,0.8,[],['puts'],0.6057142857142856
T,1o6uq6f,investing,Traditional Investment Indicators,"Every other day there is a headline or post about all time high valuations across equities, gold, BTC, etc… and where to invest given all seems “frothy”. The measurements used to determine fair valuation are many, as I’m sure this sub has often debated and pointed out as to why a stock is/isn’t a good investment depending on the investor’s risk appetite or horizon. Certain articles or if we simply back-test, show us that markets more often than not, trade close to all time highs - this is often, I feel, a mental block for a retail investor. My question is, if we can with a certain degree of accuracy and statistical correlation, agree and prove that markets trend upwards in the long run, why is it that with increasing valuations, money supply, inflation, that valuation metrics (ie. Sharpe ratio, PE, Altman-Z, etc) do not get adjusted? Adversely, if the metrics are correct, and it is only a matter of time before the market comes back to reality and corrects, doesn’t that imply there is a limit to growth?

T,1ocbiwg,ValueInvesting,Bridging Crypto and Reality: My Shift Into Real World Asset Trading,"A few months ago, I started rethinking my trading approach after realizing how disconnected most crypto narratives were from real-world value. I have been deep in DeFi and memecoins for years, but after the latest market swings, I wanted something that actually *linked blockchain with tangible assets,* something that made sense beyond the hype. That’s when I began exploring **Real World Assets (RWA),** projects tokenizing things like stocks, bonds, and even commodities. It’s crazy how fast this narrative is growing. It’s like the bridge between traditional finance and crypto is finally being built, and we’re early enough to walk across it. Through **Bitget**, I started testing RWA exposure via tokenized U.S. stocks and onchain trading. What stood out is the accessibility, 24/7 markets, instant settlement, and no middlemen slowing things down. You can trade exposure to real companies and real assets but stay entirely within the crypto ecosystem. It feels like the best of both worlds, the structure of TradFi with the freedom of Web3. For me, RWA trading on isn’t just another market trend; it’s the evolution of investing. The ability to hedge crypto volatility with real world backed assets in the same place is a serious edge. I genuinely think this is where a lot of smart traders will rotate next, where blockchain meets real utility. Anyone else diving into RWA trading lately?
