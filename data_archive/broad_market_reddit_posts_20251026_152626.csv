VOO,1nzggcq,investing,VOO and chill in retirement,"For those who like this approach, what's your plan in retirement? Say you have $1 mm in VOO, in today's prices you would hold 1626 shares. Let's say you need $4000\mo from your investment account to fund your living expenses on top of your ss income. You would need to sell 6.5 shares monthly or 78 shares yearly to meet this requirement. If voo grows at 14%, your growth will outpace your sells (228 new vs 78 sold) which is sustainable. But if the market drops like in the 2008 gfc, let's say your shares drop to $400 each, you'll need to sell 120 shares to meet your income needs. In this scenario your 1626 shares drop to 1506 shares. And each year until recovery your share count will drop. A 5 year recovery could mean a loss of 600 shares dropping to 1000 total, a 40% decline in your nest egg. Alternatively, would you consider investing in something like spyi instead? In today's prices you would hold 19,230 shares with $1mm. That would generate around $10,000\month in income. If the market tanked as in the above scenario, and say your investment income dropped by half, you would still have $5000\month investment income, without having to sell anything while still invested in a sp500 fund... Just like VOO. And if spyi continues in recovery to pay 12% while the sp500 grows at 14%, there should be no nav erosion either. Thoughts? Edit: correction to sp500 growth should probably be closer to 11% since inception rather than 14% (over the last 15 years).",53,221,2025-10-06 11:29:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nzggcq/voo_and_chill_in_retirement/,2025-10-26 06:35:52.036428,1.0,$VOO,0.8,[],['loss'],0.9057142857142856,Broad Market ETF
VOO,1oaxxe9,Bogleheads,If i make enough money investing in VOO through a brokerage account over time to retire early or realize some of the gains; as long as I dont make over 47K taxable income said year then hypothetically wouldn’t it be tax free to withdraw gains (aside from state tax)?,(Trying to decide between accounts just want to make sure I understand) And if so is it still beneficial to go with roth ira over a brokerage account if im still fairy young and able to invest a decent chunk of my weekly paychecks into VOO and should have a pretty sizable amount well before the age of 60 with the compound interest accrued? Id like to be able to use portions of it before the age of 59 to help family members out of debt etc. Is the only drawback the 5% state income tax id have to pay on dividends and gains?

I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job. I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years.

Then it gets complex.

VOO,1nr37sf,Bogleheads,Move out of FZROX into VOO?,"Let me preface this with... I wish I had found this (and other) subreddits before starting to make some of these moves. My income situation has improved recently and I've maxed out all of my tax-sheltered options so I'm now putting money into taxable accounts. By default, I put my first couple of contributions into FZROX, because mutual funds were what I knew for diversified investment (or so I thought...) In the interim, I did more reading/found more reddits and discovered the potential tax surprise/drag implications of carrying mutual funds on a taxable account, and started contributing into VOO instead. My intention is to continue doing that, maybe with some into some broader exposure ETFs (though I don't particularly see the need right now, following the S&P seems to be the way to go). Now, I'm in a position where I'd like to protect myself long-term and get out of FZROX, but I've also made some fairly significant gains in FZROX due to market performance this year so moving out of it will cost me a pretty penny. I've already resigned myself to waiting until the year mark so I can take the long-term capital gains rate, but even then that's still going to cost me a good chunk of those gains. I'm really not a fan of trying to time the market, I would rather set it and forget it, so this is where I'm at right now... do I just leave what I have in FZROX in there and take the tax hits as they come? Do I move out immediately as soon as I hit the capital gains rate? Or do I bide my time and try and take advantage of a downturn to make that move?

I've been lurking this sub for a while and I never really had the money to make significant investments, but my situation changed and I want to set myself up for the future. I'm 24M living at home with my parents, no expenses besides gas/insurance, leisure, and additional food outside of what's cooked for dinner. I got hired at the post office so I left my old job, and was recently able to over my old employee sponsored 401k plan into a Roth IRA (my reasoning being that I'm in a low tax bracket and I'd know exactly how much I could pull out once the time comes). I don't come from much financial knowledge or success, I grew up and still live in a HCOL area (Long Island, NY) and I've seen what my parents have had to do to keep food on the table and while I greatly appreciate it, I don't want to put myself through the same type of stress. My first question is: What should I invest my IRA holdings in for the most amount of growth over the long term? From what I've learned, I'm assuming I can just buy all VT just to set it and forget it for a while as i continue to contribute, then down the line diversify my contributions for more stability. My goal is to retire as early as possible, and the fastest way to do that seems to be getting your money to work for you as much as possible. Since starting my new job, I cleared all my credit card debt and have a plan to pay off my student loans by the end of 2026. After that I don't have any debt and don't plan to incur any until I can start considering buying a house hopefully in the next 10 years. I buy my cars off Marketplace in cash so no worries about payments, pay my insurance policy in full so that it's a one time expense, and I've been adjusting my lifestyle to significantly cut down on leisurely spending and focus on investing in my future. My Roth has about $9k after the rollover, but most of it has been sitting uninvested the last couple days due to me not wanting to make a costly wrong decision or accidentally set myself back. Outside of my IRAs I've bought $1k in both VOO and VTI so that I'd at least be making something while I mull over the decision, any and all advice is greatly appreciated so thank you guys in advance!",23,18,2025-10-19 13:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oapx46/vt_and_chillright/,2025-10-26 06:36:04.605096,0.5,$VOO,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999,Broad Market ETF

Any legitimate investor isn’t buying something that “might” be worth more later, yet isn’t producing anything of value. Meanwhile the VTI and chill crowd is up 15% YTD, after two consecutive 20%+ years. I have no qualms with an international hedge, if you believe in that, and ignore currency risks/fluctuations.

VOO,1ntzajp,investing,"In investing, what are the advantages and disadvantages of growth vs. dividend investing?","If you've ever been to r/Bogleheads or r/dividends, you've seen two ends of a spectrum where both are convinced the other side are idiots. Personally, I lean in the Boglehead direction, but I'd really like to expand my knowledge and get a better idea of the overall pros and cons of both sides. I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications. On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times. That's about the extent of my knowledge though.

VOO,1odxsfc,Bogleheads,I lost almost all because I am dumb,"Hello Guys, Today I want to tell you one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Usually I am very careful with my money and have been almost entirely invested in ETFs. Some time ago I pulled all my money from ETFs because I feared the market would crash (I know timing the market usually doesn't work). Then yesterday for whatever reason my brain stopped working and I put almost everything I had in to BYND. Unfortunately I had a very high buy in price and now realized my losses, which amount to over 45k$. I lost half my money on this incredibly stupid mistake and I really hope, that I have learned for life. Currently I am 27 years old soon to be 28 and making about 100k gross a year. Around 4k net a month but have to pay 1k for rent. What should I do with the money that I have left? I know usually the answer is ETFs but I really really think some correction must be coming soon. Usually I would probably just buy VOO or All world ETF for 70-80% of my portfolio, keep around 15% to invest in to individual stocks and about 5% for crypto or some kind of ""gambling""!

VOO,1obz0sw,Bogleheads,Need advice on investments with my advisor,"Hello! Throw away account for anonymity. Sort of a long story but here it goes. I have been saving/investing for about 18 years mainly focusing on my employer's 401k program. About two years ago, I switched jobs and had to decide what to do with my 401k, if anything. I have had a financial advisor pretty much the whole time whom I have been paying a flat fee per year (completely worth it in my case imo). To give a bit of pertinent info, the advisor is also a close friend whom I trust and is a CFP. When asked what shall I do with my 401k, he took his time and was going back and forth whether I should just leave it or roll it into my new job's 401k program. We also discussed opening an IRA with his company (a large and relatively well known wealth management company). He wasn't pushing me either way, just laying out info and options. Although I had been saving and investing, I really didn't know much as far as finances go so I was hoping for guidance on this decision. We ended up opening an IRA with about 80% of the old 401k and put the rest into the 401k with my new job(target date fund). Again, he is a close friend whom I have trusted. He said it would be an actively managed account and he would charge me the lowest fee he could which is 0.5%. I have learned this is actually pretty good as far as AUM fees go (I realize this is highly debatable) but I was comfortable with this as I trust him. Fast forward 2 years later and here we are. I have been really digging deep (at least to me lol) to learn as much as I could about investing and finance. I also have since realized I would like to retire as soon as is feasible, which likely will not be for at least about 10 years, more likely 15. But what I have learned is that it is extremely hard to beat returns on an index fund such as VOO and others. And on top of that, the fees are much better (my 401k has a fee of 0.08%). I know that there are different risk levels and that will determine returns as well. I have always been a moderately aggressive to aggressive investor based on his firm's terminology. The IRA currently is 80% equity, 12.5% fixed income, 5% alternative and 2.5% cash. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples to my 401K to see if I made the right choice as I suspect I may not have. The **401K rate of return is: 17.27% ytd and 15.02% for just the year 2024**. I used these timeframes as the account has only been open about 2 years and when I tried asking for the return rate for 1/1/24-10/19/25 it said 35.2% which didn't seem right. The **IRA rate of return is: 13.38% ytd and 11.98% for 2024**. This is before fees I assume so take off another 0.5% plus fees for the various funds (the portfolio has no less than 25 positions). I would like to stick with him at least as far as the flat fee annual financial planning and guidance goes but I am having second thoughts on the investments. So my questions are: 1. Does this look like a fair comparison? 2. If so, is it a good idea to leave these investments in the IRA? I am not looking forward to the conversation of taking out my funds but I definitely will if I determine it is in the best interest for me and my family.

VOO,1o1tlzd,Bogleheads,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability. But that aside, why would someone choose broad based funds like VTI or VOO over more focused options like SP100 or SCHG? Edit: Thanks everyone! I really enjoyed reading your thoughts on investing and life. It’s super interesting and refreshing to hear different perspectives.

VOO,1nx45ob,stocks,Newish investor - should I worry?,"Was skimming through the CNBC news app and read this fear mongering article (can’t post attachments so will copy paste some parts): - “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday. Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names. Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks: Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner. Many investors assume investing in the S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said. If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur. But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%. Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future. Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback. Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies. Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks. That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k. With a good amount of money in there now, this article just worried me. What you guys think, is this still the strategy ?

I have a long standing money market and roth ira account with Edward Jones but the more control I have with vanguard and fidelity is appealing. Recently created a roth on fidelity and playing with which etfs to include. currently have about $100 in it, 20% SCHD and QQQI/SPMO/SPYI/VT at 10% each with 40% left in unallocated funds, based on investor youtube videos. My question is twofold. My EJ Roth has a return rate (since inception in 2021) of about 11%. It has averaged 20% per year except for 2022 which was -20%, i assume a covid related crash. Problem is that most portfolios I find in videos average about 7% per year. Much less than the 11% EJ seems to be giving me. Im tempted to switch but if the difference really is that drastic it makes more financial sense to stay with them. Is it normal to have such wide variance with returns, and a much higher average return at that? Second: I am interested in upping my liquid investments as well, but I want to do so in a way that minimizes my taxes. I currently have about 40k with FNILX but thinking about switching to VOO for the portability.

VOO,1ny1npl,stocks,Is there a best way to protect your 401k if there was a crash?,"This is all theoretical for an example. Let's say a person has $25,000 usd in a Roth 401k and that money is in an ETF like VOO. There are no other assets such as real estate, gold or crypto. What is the best way to reduce the impact from a market crash or collapse. Could you change say the ETF like VOO if you think a crash will happen to another stock or asset group that would be less volatile and a crash would not impact it as much? Potentially change to foreign assets or something idk, something that would lessen the impact. I understand markets will go up and down, but is there a way to reduce the impact from a crash? From my understanding the roth 401k could not be changed to assets like gold easily. One could roll the 401k into a self-directed Gold IRA account that allows for gold investment. I don't really know much more than that and seems a bit complicated and you could lose larger gains after the crash potentially.

VOO,1ocq8u8,investing,How do you feel about self-directed retirement plan through employer-sponsored 457/401?,"I currently have a retirement plan through my employer where about 40% of my funds are self-directed vs picking different options through my plan administrator. I chose to move those funds, to a self-directed broker; it is not automatic. My knowledge of investing is fairly limited and high level as I just haven't had the time to really learn about investing. I do not even know if the statement I made above makes any sense. Most of my self-directed funds are in ETFs. It was explained to me that going this route has lesser fees than if I were to go through a plan offered by my administrator. I do have investments in individual stocks as well (using my retirement plan) Part of me is getting nervous about the stock market in general but I can't explain why since my understanding is surface level. My self-directed portion has been pretty successful so far but so has the rest of my retirement that's manages through administrator. I'm turning 40 next year so I have plenty of time left in my career. Knowing me, I am not at the point where I am able to make really educated decisions on what ETFs or stocks to invest in. Should I reallocate all my funds into the self-directed brokerage account and invest into different ETFs? Should I move my funds that are in individual stocks into ETFs? Or should I just stay the course?
