AAPL,1njcfnv,wallstreetbets,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B üöÄ)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B üöÄ)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

AAPL,1ng2qrk,wallstreetbets,In 5 days i gained back 9 months of losses.,"That pump mid chart was April 8th-9th. Got lucky with NVDA and SPY puts for liberation day, then on the 9th I got in midway on apple calls for about 2k. Proceeded to lose big from either buying in at a bad time and selling for a loss, buying and it going in the wrong direction immediately, holding out on hope for the next day to crush me, being greedy wanting more profits and watching it all fall. All those reasons led to that bottom point on september 4th.

This past 2 weeks I got luckier than all fuck on my option picks. Wish I held the oracle calls but the euphoria of going from being over leveraged by 1k, (hence why my account reads into the negative after pulling out my money) to earning 15k in 7 trading days. I took out 12k, and bought myself essentially a free trip next weekend. 11k in the savings, 3k on OPEN 13C for 9/26, which i sold some already for a profit.

AAPL,1no5e8t,investing,Best 8 stocks for short term growth,"Hey guys, not sure if this post is going to be deleted, but I need some general advice from some more educated people.

I've been assigned a project where I have to invest a fake $500 000 into 5-10 stocks, and I was wondering if my choices will be optimal for short term growth over a semester.

I have currently chosen: AAPL, NVDA, RHM.DE, CCJ, L, PLTR, TSLA, KRYS

Now because I am just starting to learn about stocks, and have started to develop a deep interest in them. I was wondering if you guys believe that I'd be well positioned to win this project? (I understand that we can never be 100% sure, and we cant predict the future.)

AAPL,1nbchk7,investing,Does tax-loss harvesting actually do anything?,"I am 67 years old and have around $450k in my pension, two 401(k)s and an IRA. However I also have 11,200 shares of AAPL in a brokerage account with a total cost basis under $6000. So I don't want to sell anything while I am still working for fear of exceeding the $200k Obamacare tax threshold and triggering the additional 3.8% tax. I have been talking to the investment advisors at my bank who are trying to convince me to let them manage everything with the aim of using tax-lost harvesting to sell my AAPL shares and diversify before I retire at 70. Does this make any sense at all? It seems to me that eventually I will need to pay capital gains tax one way or another and my goal is to keep as much of that to 15% tax as possible. Also FYI I live in Washington State so there is a second 7% tax on all capital gains over $270,000 or so.",63,129,2025-09-08 02:52:48,2025-09-25 02:30:07.858369
AAPL,1nahs5r,investing,Why no Leveraged ETF under 1x?,"There‚Äôs been an explosion of leveraged funds of all different types recently, and it‚Äôs getting a little ridiculous: There are 1.5x, 2x, 3x, for indexes, sectors, industries, countries, and even individual stocks. Want 2x leverage for Japanese stocks? No problem- EZJ. Want 2x leverage for AAPL? AAPU is for you. And there‚Äôs dozens of 2x short ETFs too. But, as far as I can tell, there‚Äôs no leveraged funds between 0 and 1x, and I don‚Äôt see why. 

The benefit of leveraged funds is obviously higher yields, and the drawback is volatility decay. If the S&P 500 goes up 20$ and then back down 20$, you end up losing money with leverage. With a lower leverage, like .75, the opposite would happen. Instead of volatility decay, you‚Äôd have volatility *growth.* Something like this would actually offer upside when the stock market is flat and protect against downside while offering only slightly limiting upside in a bull market. Look at the example below:

Let‚Äôs pretend the ABC index is at 100$. It drops 4%, or 4$, then returns to where it was at $100. In this scenario, if I owned 1 share of ABC, I would end up with a 0% gain. I‚Äôd start with $100 and have exactly $100 at the end.

Now let‚Äôs say I own shares of a .75x leveraged ETF that tracks the ABC index. Let‚Äôs call this ETF ABCL. If I own $100 of ABCL, then when ABC drops by 4%, ABCL would drop 3%. I‚Äôd have 97$. But when ABC goes back up 4$, it actually grows by 4.17%. Therefore, ABCL would grow by 3.13%, which gives a total of $100.04, which is .04% above the underlying. Yeah, that‚Äôs not much, but in a flat market that‚Äôs at least something. If the market stays relatively flat over a 6-month period, those fractions of a percent would add up. Plus, there‚Äôs the downside protection. If an index drops 40% and returns to its previous high, .75x leverage puts you back at 105% at a minimum. There‚Äôs serious money to be made for anyone who can predict a big downturn.

I‚Äôve done a bit amount of digging, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything like this. Why not?",0,28,2025-09-07 02:31:11,2025-09-25 02:30:07.858388
AAPL,1n96la8,investing,Looks like Warren Buffett proved it was time for him to retire,"Just was noticing AAPL is having a good run and thought I'd look and see what price it was when BRK sold. For reference, AAPL is trading at $240 this morning, Buffett sold at $190-$200. So basically, BRK gave up a 25% gain so they could buy more 5% treasuries? Yikes.

Buffett looked like a genius in April when the tariff's first hit but for the past 6 months the S&P 500 has beat BRK 10-to-1. He's still slightly ahead of the S&P 500 YTD but over the past 12 months the S&P 500 is up 18% compared to 9% for BRK. What's interesting is BRK actually had a good run against the S&P 500 for several years, which was largely timed along his ownership of AAPL.

I understand a conglomerate like BRK sitting on cash is not necessarily the same as ""timing the market"" like us regular joes. But Warren said for years there were no good deals, while the market has continued to say otherwise.

EDIT - I'm getting a lot of grief over this. But if you look at what WB has said in the recent past, what he did with AAPL goes against the grain of what has made BRK successful. In 2021 after selling his airline positions at a loss Buffet said ""When we sell something, very often it‚Äôs going to be our entire stake: We don‚Äôt trim positions. That‚Äôs just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We‚Äôre going to sell it down to 90% or 80%. If we like a business, we‚Äôre going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd when we change our mind we don‚Äôt take half measures.‚Äù Again that quote wasn't from the 80's, that was 4 years ago.",0,36,2025-09-05 14:20:51,2025-09-25 02:30:07.858403

AAPL,1n32vqy,investing,"Hi, freshly starting investing into stocks. I need advice on the following potential portfolios. I am torn between multiple different versions.","Hello, I am a 21-year-old male investor from Australia using Pearler as my broker platform of choice. My primary goals are:

Long-term wealth accumulation (15-25+ year time horizon).
High growth, prioritizing capital appreciation.
A well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.
Financial Independence / Retire Early (FIRE), with an ambition to eventually have my portfolio generate enough passive income to cover at least some of my living expenses (e.g., rent or groceries).

I am looking for a second opinion on three potential portfolio allocations. My current portfolio looks really solid, but I've been considering multiple alternative drafts.
Please provide a detailed analysis of each portfolio, including an assessment of its strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for my stated goals. Pay close attention to how each portfolio's asset choices affect the trade-off between capital growth and passive income.

AAPL,1n1u5je,investing,Experience with AI-driven portfolio so far,"Hey everyone! I've decided to try something different and vibe-coded a portfolio management system. It's basically an LLM with a bunch of tools to design a portfolio for you according to your investment goal. I've been test-driving it for about 6 weeks, and here are my results so far.

The goal was to build a moderate risk portfolio with some crypto exposure.

Initially it gave me this:

AAPL 5%  
MSFT 5%  
BND 10%  
ICLN 5%  
QQQ 10%  
SCHD 10%  
VNQ 5%  
VTI 25%  
VXUS 15%  
ETH-USD, BTC-USD 5% each

it went about 4% up so far. I got a little lucky with massive jump in ETH, at which point it suggested to rotate some of the profits into SGOV/BND, and reduce crypto exposure in general, so I'm down to about 6% crypto total.

ICLN was a little surprising as a recommendation, considering the political climate, but it paid off so far, up about 7%. 

Probably lucky timing as well, since the market was up in general. Actually the only losing investment was BTC-USD, down about 5%.

The whole portfolio looks pretty conventional, which is probably not too surprising considering that LLM would likely give you middle-of-the-road advice.",0,4,2025-08-27 21:45:03,2025-09-25 02:30:07.858436

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

AAPL,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

GOOGL,1npjlwc,wallstreetbets,$GAP - Yolo,"NFA, DYOR.

A few people posted DD on this. I didn't do it myself - credit goes to these guys

I read this DD (primary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking much more successful. IE: Youtube ads have 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. They went totally viral with the younger generation, with many people reposting videos / replicating the dances. Inventory was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked when the DD was posted (6 days ago)

\---

As well as this one (secondary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

This only came to my attention as 2 guys in my dm's mentioned it to me & I've heard of GAP before (founded in the 1960s) so took a look. I did some very high level due diligence on, they might be right (but we won't know for months)

My DD looked at a few things. Price: It's currently trading lower than when both those DD's were posted (it's on a 3 week dip). They were all bullish (ie: good sentiment) -- I can't evaluate this one well tho due to small sample size. Chatted with a few people about it in my dm's, overall unsure how this one plays. Seems everyone had the same thesis tho. I bought these calls this morning after doing \~30 minutes of my own DD. It looks like it's been consolidating for months. The DD I read looks real (ie: those posts didn't look to be bots to me). It doesn't look to have bots pumping it either. I missed AEO + impact of social media (Sweeney really did carry them) so I checked google trends. Yes - the trends / searches & this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. Compounded with the school season timing, this could do well. It has already run a bit in the last few months -- so things could also be priced in. We won't know until ER's tho -- which is in November. I also am aware not near as many people here are aware of the ad campaign (ie: I wasn't). I validated it was real myself tho. I didn't see too many people talking about it here / in the daily / etc - I only became aware as some guys in my dm's dropped me the dd and asked for thoughts. One of the times my play comes thru dm's / other places than the daily. Just like things like $SNAP tho - just because you think it's dead, doesn't mean it is. See the 1st linked DD for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did.

I bought 4 months of time. I picked these strikes and expirations for risk management (sufficient time for the next ER's + a little buffer room). If the thesis is true, it'll shoot past 25. If false - probably sideways (and I eat theta decay). As with all my other plays - 4 months of time doesn't imply I'll be holding for 4 months.

Current P/E is 9.8, and IV is super low so calls are cheap imo. They have a solid dividend too + been around long enough that they're not going anywhere so shares are also an alright bet imo. Payoff of these calls is \~5:1 if they hit the PT's defined in the DD post, and downside is \~50% loss assuming they decay and we just go sideways. IE: Positive EV with an expected \~2.5:1 payoff. Shares may have a \~50% upside, ie: \~1.5:1 payoff. Since not many people have been discussing this one - I haven't been able to quantify risks well. I bought calls due to higher EV & the nature of my high risk investing. I'm either early or wrong, only time will tell.

GOOGL,1np10yv,wallstreetbets,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it‚Äôs overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn‚Äôt run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company‚Äôs robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)‚Äîa segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, ‚ÄúWe process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,‚Äù underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD‚Äôs platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD‚Äôs scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth‚Äîespecially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

GOOGL,1nm0a5q,wallstreetbets,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won‚Äôt affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they‚Äôre winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron‚Äôs memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  Ôøº

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that‚Äôs a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  Ôøº
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúWedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron‚Äôs future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.‚Äù „ÄêBarron‚Äôs„Äë

Barclays ‚Äì PT $175

‚ÄúBarclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.‚Äù „ÄêBarron‚Äôs„Äë

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) ‚Äì PT $175

‚ÄúDeutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.‚Äù „ÄêInvestors.com„Äë

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) ‚Äì PT $182

‚ÄúMizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron‚Äôs results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron‚Äôs increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.‚Äù „ÄêMarketWatch„Äë

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) ‚Äì PT $185

‚ÄúUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron‚Äôs price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron‚Äôs technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.‚Äù „ÄêPriceTargets.com„Äë

Susquehanna ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúSusquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron‚Äôs earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.‚Äù „ÄêPriceTargets.com„Äë

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) ‚Äì PT $185

‚ÄúJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron‚Äôs price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron‚Äôs HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.‚Äù „ÄêBenzinga„Äë

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúRosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm‚Äôs target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron‚Äôs November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.‚Äù „ÄêBenzinga„Äë

‚ÄúZacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks‚Äô consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron‚Äôs strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.‚Äù „ÄêZacks / MarketBeat„Äë

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20‚Äì30%, pushing toward $180‚Äì$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78‚Äì$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42‚Äì43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop ‚àí10‚Äì25%, retracing toward $120‚Äì$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. 

Good luck üôè",218,165,2025-09-20 14:54:22,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293152
GOOGL,1nl8km0,wallstreetbets,Duolingo DD,"Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I‚Äôve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying ‚Äúwtf the language learning app?‚Äù. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you‚Äôre an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but¬†

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%.¬†

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. ‚ÄúHow is this bullish?‚Äù Well lets think, what‚Äôs Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo‚Äôs demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It‚Äôs like saying in the year 2000, ‚Äúwhy would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?‚Äù fucking regards.¬†

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what‚Äôs most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers.¬†

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that ‚Äúding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of ‚Äúessential apps.‚Äù

	When people talk to each other about music they ask ‚Äúwhat's you‚Äôre spotify?‚Äù Nobody asks whats your ‚Äúapple music, amazon music or youtube music‚Äù

	When your wife‚Äôs boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says ‚Äúnetflix and chill‚Äù NOT ‚Äúamazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?‚Äù the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo‚Äôs subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess.¬†

Wait? Chess? Wtf?¬†

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc‚Ä¶

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would¬† put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification.¬†

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we‚Äôre fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn‚Äôt ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative.¬†

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can‚Äôt afford to lower rates but rather might¬† increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.¬†

|Free cash flow|$53.7|$86.3|**61%**|
|Free cash flow margin|30.1%|34.2%|\~4 pts|

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company‚Äôs growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity.¬†

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you.

GOOGL,1nl4g6m,wallstreetbets,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you‚Äôve seen my last couple posts I‚Äôve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I‚Äôm a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I‚Äôm rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500‚Äôs worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you‚Äôre a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don‚Äôt call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD‚Äôs slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn‚Äôt have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren‚Äôt taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre undervalued‚Äù or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don‚Äôt care either way because I think they‚Äôll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said ‚ÄúTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green‚Äôs imaginings.

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok‚Äôs walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",91,61,2025-09-19 14:03:11,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293362

GOOGL,1nkow7c,wallstreetbets,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 ‚Äì 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B ‚Äì beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call ‚Äì 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney‚Äôs labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat ‚Äì SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management ‚Äì they noted that they saw ‚Äúnice upticks‚Äù in the AE business in Q3 ‚Äì signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook ‚Äì coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw ‚Äúnice upticks‚Äù in the AE business in Q3 ‚Äì signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook ‚Äì coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline)¬†

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They‚Äôre much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally ‚Äì operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella ‚Äì GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn‚Äôt say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral ‚Äì similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok ‚Äì just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I‚Äôm sure I probably haven‚Äôt seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP‚Äôs earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn‚Äôt find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT ‚Äì the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim ‚Äì which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP‚Äôs earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their ‚Äúreinvigoration‚Äù efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it‚Äôs been touted as ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù to do an Ad in comparison to AEO‚Äôs campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs ‚Äì their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that‚Äôs about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets ‚Äì we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls ‚Äì who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I‚Äôve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok‚Äôs original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE‚Äôs main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE‚Äôs best ads.

   * Instagram‚Äôs original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE‚Äôs main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube‚Äôs Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE‚Äôs remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations ‚Äì and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a ‚ÄúCrop Tank Top‚Äù, which you‚Äôd have to scroll down to find ‚Äì but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

GOOGL,1nhanqj,wallstreetbets,"+600k this weeks, thanks GLXY","Galaxy Digital was getting crazy undervalued the last couple weeks. Tons of extremely positive news on both the crypto side of their business and data center side. Looking to roll these into 2026's when they should get a portion of their 2.7GW understudy approved by ERCOT (on top of the 800MW they already have approved/leased) and leased out to a big hyperscaler like Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta.

If the full 3.5GW is approved and leased out at the same terms as their current CoreWeave deal, Galaxy could generate ~$5.25B/year in average annual revenues at 90% EBITDA margins (market cap Friday was ~$11B (@~$30/share), subtract their $3B balance sheet and you get ~$8B in equity value attributable to their crypto and data center business).

Think a fair price in the short term is $54/share (w/no additional approvals) and then gets into the $100's of dollars / share range if they can execute on their 3.5GWs + future power/site acquisitions.

I truly believe this is only the beginning of the journey and we are still so early. Just this week the senior management of the company met with 50+ institutions and I‚Äôm expecting we catch a bid in Q4, please keep in mind Galaxy has only been listed on the NASDAQ since the middle of May.

GOOGL,1ne8vin,wallstreetbets,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

3. **Update on expansion pipeline:** By **Aug 15, 2025**, Galaxy says it has **2.7 GW of additional power capacity under various stages of load study**, with **potential to 3.5 GW** at full build-out; this is separate from (and **in addition to**) the 800 MW already contracted to CoreWeave.

4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2‚Äô25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader ‚Äúunder study‚Äù pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** ‚ÄúAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure‚Äù was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the ‚Äú**Begin Actual Construction**‚Äù definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn‚Äôt final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council‚Äôs dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there‚Äôs **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren‚Äôt there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA‚Äôs Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

GOOGL,1ndis0f,wallstreetbets,Why would hyperscalers spend so much with $ORCL instead of just spending themselves?,"UPDATE: It's apparently$300B just from OpeniAI. So yeah, like I hypothesized, the hyperscalers don't need shit from Oracle and there is a high chance most of this doesn't happen. OpenAI can't afford $300B.

I don't get it. They say they got $400B in backlogs from only a few customers, which means like $100B+ per customer. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon...

There are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

It's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.

The whole cloud revenue/order backlog thing looks like bullshit to me. It's going to grow $144B in cloud revenue in 5 years? Uh, I don't see Google, Microsoft, or Amazon doubling cloud revenue every year, so how the fuck is Oracle?",291,103,2025-09-10 16:20:54,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293676

GOOGL,1n9n3mt,wallstreetbets,Snap (SNAP): Acquisition Target or Dead Money?,"So Snap‚Äôs stock has been in free fall ‚Äî down over 90% from the $80 peak in 2021, now sitting around $7. At the same time, the company still has ~469M daily active users, mostly Gen Z, who treat it like an operating system for their social life (AR lenses, Bitmoji, Maps, AI assistant, etc).

Here‚Äôs the case for why people think Snap is a buyout candidate:
	‚Ä¢	Valuation: Trading at one of the lowest price-to-sales multiples in social media. Dirt cheap compared to Meta, Pinterest, or TikTok‚Äôs implied value.
	‚Ä¢	User Base: Half a billion DAUs is nothing to sneeze at. Extremely sticky with younger demographics.
	‚Ä¢	Strategic Fit: Big tech (Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix, etc) could bolt this onto their ecosystem. Rumors of Alphabet interest pre-IPO have floated before.
	‚Ä¢	Market Sentiment: Polls show a lot of retail/institutional investors believe Snap gets bought out in the next 1‚Äì2 years.

But here‚Äôs the catch:
	‚Ä¢	Founder Control: Evan Spiegel & Bobby Murphy still hold ~96% of the voting power. If they don‚Äôt want to sell, it doesn‚Äôt matter how attractive the numbers look.
	‚Ä¢	Current Strategy: Snap‚Äôs been on offense, buying up smaller apps like Saturn (popular in U.S. high schools). That‚Äôs not what you do if you‚Äôre prepping for a sale.
	‚Ä¢	Execution Risk: Advertising headwinds, competition from TikTok/Instagram, and weak monetization continue to crush the stock.

TL;DR: On paper, Snap looks like one of the most attractive acquisition targets in tech cheap, highly engaged user base, potential fit for multiple buyers. But with founder control and ongoing internal growth moves, it‚Äôs far from a guaranteed outcome. If anything, it‚Äôs a speculative play on either a turnaround or someone eventually forcing their hand.

GOOGL,1n95r4r,wallstreetbets,All-in! $1 Million in HUT 8 (parent company of American Bitcoin) $HUT $ABTC,"Comprehensive Bull Case for Hut 8 Corp ($HUT): Evolving from Bitcoin Mining to a Powerhouse in AI, HPC, and Energy Infrastructure

Hut 8 Corp, ticker $HUT on Nasdaq and TSX, started back in 2017 as one of North America's largest Bitcoin mining operations. Over the years, they've evolved into a full-fledged energy infrastructure platform, focusing on the intersection of power generation, digital infrastructure, and high-performance computing (HPC). Think of them as a ""power-first"" company that's building the backbone for energy-intensive tech like AI, cloud computing, and yes, still crypto mining.

Their business is structured in three layers:

1. Power (Layer 1.0)\*\*: This is the foundation. Hut 8 acquires, develops, and manages energy assets like interconnects, powered land, and electrical infrastructure. They have a joint venture with Macquarie for power generation, owning and operating four natural gas power plants in Ontario, Canada. They also offer managed services to institutional investors, helping them develop energy infrastructure end-to-end.
2. Digital Infrastructure (Layer 2.0)\*\*: Here, they design, build, and operate data centers tailored for heavy-duty applications. This includes ASIC colocation (hosting third-party Bitcoin mining hardware), CPU colocation for enterprise workloads like storage and networking, and flexible facilities that can pivot between crypto and other uses.
3. Compute (Layer 3.0)\*\*: The top layer focuses on specialized hardware. This encompasses Bitcoin mining (now through their subsidiary American Bitcoin), data center cloud services (backup, disaster recovery, etc.), and GPU-as-a-Service via Highrise AI ‚Äì a platform built specifically for AI workloads.

Hut 8 isn't just a Bitcoin miner anymore ‚Äì they're a diversified infrastructure play betting on the explosive demand for power in AI and HPC, where data centers are gobbling up electricity like never before.

Fueling the Growth Engine

1. Massive Capacity Expansion: Doubling Down on Power in a Scarce Market

Hut 8 just announced plans to develop four new sites across the US (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), adding a whopping 1.53 GW of capacity. That's more than doubling their current power under management to over 2.5 GW across 19 locations. In a world where power is the new oil ‚Äì especially with AI training models requiring insane energy ‚Äì this is huge. These sites range from 50 MW to 1 GW each and are strategically placed in areas with growing energy demand and supportive regulations.

Why does this matter? Power scarcity is a real bottleneck for tech giants like Google, Amazon, and OpenAI. Hut 8's ability to secure and develop these assets positions them as a key supplier. If they monetize even a fraction for HPC or AI colocation, the revenue potential is enormous. Analysts at Benchmark raised their price target to $36 on this news alone, citing the expansion's role in driving upside.

2. Carving Out Bitcoin Mining into American Bitcoin: Unlocking Value and Reducing Risk

One of the smartest moves Hut 8 has made is spinning out their direct Bitcoin mining operations into a new entity called American Bitcoin (ABTC). This partnership with Eric Trump, transfers Hut 8's Compute division (which generated $80.7 million in revenue last year) into a standalone company focused purely on Bitcoin accumulation and yield.

Hut 8 will retain a majority stake (around 64%) and act as the exclusive infrastructure partner via long-term agreements. American Bitcoin is set to go public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, expected to go public this week, trading on Nasdaq under $ABTC.

This separation achieves a few things:  
\- Lower Capital Intensity: Mining is volatile and capex-heavy. By isolating it, Hut 8 can focus on stable, contracted revenues from hosting, power sales, and AI services.  
\- Access to Cheaper Capital: As a ""pure-play"" energy infra company, Hut 8 becomes more attractive to institutional lenders. They just secured a $200 million revolving credit facility backed by Bitcoin, boosting liquidity to $2.4 billion. They also issued a $5B ATM to accumulate even more Bitcoin.  
\- Valuation Clarity: The public listing of ABTC will put a market price on Hut 8's stake, potentially unlocking hidden value. If ABTC trades well (as a top Bitcoin holder with efficient ops), it could add billions to Hut 8's implied worth.

This move is straight out of the playbook for value creation ‚Äì think of it like a conglomerate spinning off a division to let each part shine.

The Full Bull Case: Here's why I'm bullish on $HUT as a long-term hold (targeting 3-5 years):

1. \*\*Power Scarcity as a Moat\*\*: With global data center demand projected to triple by 2030, companies like Hut 8 that control power assets are golden. Their 1.5 GW expansion isn't just growth ‚Äì it's a defensive play in a constrained grid. Monetizing for AI/HPC could yield high-margin, long-term contracts (think 10-20 year PPAs).
2. \*\*Diversification Reduces Crypto Risk\*\*: Post-carve-out, Hut 8 becomes less tied to Bitcoin volatility. Revenue shifts to stable sources: hosting fees, power sales, AI cloud services. American Bitcoin provides upside exposure without dragging down the core business.
3. \*\*Valuation Unlock and Catalysts\*\*: The ABTC spin-out is a near-term catalyst (closing soon). If ABTC's market cap reflects its Bitcoin holdings and efficiency, Hut 8's stake could be worth more than the current enterprise value. Plus, the $200M credit line gives ammo for more acquisitions/expansions. Stock looks undervalued ‚Äì trading at a discount to NAV, with analysts seeing 2-3x upside.
4. \*\*Macro Tailwinds\*\*: Bitcoin halving cycles, AI boom, and US energy policy (e.g., incentives for domestic infra) all play in Hut 8's favor. They're in growth hotspots like Texas, where power demand is skyrocketing.
5. \*\*Efficiency and Scale\*\*: As one of the most efficient miners (pre-spin), and now a scaled infra player, margins should improve. Q2 profitability is a sign of things to come.

Thesis Summary:

Hut 8 is transforming into a high-growth energy/tech hybrid, with the ABTC carve-out and capacity build-out as key inflection points. In a bull-case scenario, this could be a 5-10x from current levels if AI adoption accelerates and Bitcoin rallies. If you're looking for exposure to the AI/power nexus with a side of crypto upside, Hut 8 deserves a spot on your watchlist.",11,24,2025-09-05 13:47:39,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293758

GOOGL,1n8phu8,wallstreetbets,"2.8k to 50k, 1800% Returns Over the Summer","I started with 2.8k in AMD leaps back in February. They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.



My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.



I read about Donald Jr.‚Äôs new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.



I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y‚Äôall seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost.¬†



The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don‚Äôt even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there‚Äôs this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  



At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they‚Äôre even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I‚Äôm somehow at 50k.

GOOGL,1n4wvy8,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia‚Äôs top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two¬†Nvidia¬†customers made up 39% of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial¬†filing¬†on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker‚Äôs clientele.

‚ÄúCustomer A‚Äù made up 23% of total revenue, and ‚ÄúCustomer B‚Äù comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company‚Äôs second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That‚Äôs higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia‚Äôs top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia‚Äôs explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as¬†Microsoft,¬†Amazon,¬†Google¬†and¬†Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that ‚Äúlarge cloud service providers‚Äù made up about 50% of the company‚Äôs data center revenue. That‚Äôs important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia‚Äôs overall revenue in the second quarter.

‚ÄúWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,‚Äù Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

‚ÄúWe see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,‚Äù wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia‚Äôs Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It‚Äôs a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both ‚Äúdirect customers‚Äù and ‚Äúindirect customers.‚Äù Customer A and Customer B are listed as ‚Äúdirect customers.‚Äù

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia‚Äôs chips. They‚Äôre companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia‚Äôs direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia‚Äôs mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an ‚ÄúAI research and development company‚Äù contributed a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company‚Äôs AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and ‚Äúneoclouds,‚Äù which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for ‚Äúsovereign AI.‚Äù All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia‚Äôs revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend ‚Äî $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

‚ÄúAs you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,‚Äù Huang said.",1627,261,2025-08-31 14:58:16,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293872

Google¬†has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

‚ÄúRight now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports‚Äù than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. ‚ÄúSo a lot of fast progress there.‚Äù

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, ‚Äúinternal barriers‚Äù and Google‚Äôs culture after several recent rounds of layoffs,¬†buyouts¬†and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

‚ÄúWhen we look across our entire leadership population, that‚Äôs managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,‚Äù he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO¬†Sundar Pichai¬†weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company ‚Äúto be more efficient as we scale up so we don‚Äôt solve everything with headcount.‚Äù

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year,¬†said¬†in October that she would push cost cuts ‚Äúa little further.‚Äù Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring,¬†asking¬†employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented ‚ÄúVoluntary Exit Program‚Äù offers. They‚Äôve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year.¬†

Fiona Cicconi, Google‚Äôs chief people officer, said at last week‚Äôs meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

‚ÄúThis has been actually quite successful,‚Äù she said, adding ‚ÄúI think we can continue it.‚Äù

Pichai said the company executed the¬†voluntary buyouts¬†after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of work that‚Äôs gone into implementing the VEP program, and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve done it,‚Äù Pichai said. ‚ÄúIt gives people agency, and I‚Äôm glad to see it‚Äôs worked out well.‚Äù

‚ÄòWanting a career break‚Äô

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually quite interesting to see who‚Äôs taking a VEP, and it‚Äôs people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,‚Äù she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs¬†hurt morale¬†as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet‚Äôs shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to¬†Meta‚Äôs¬†‚Äúrecharge,‚Äù a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

‚ÄúWe have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that ‚Äî resting and recharging,‚Äù said Alexandra Maddison, Google‚Äôs senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very confident that our current offering is competitive,‚Äù Maddison said.

Meta didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies‚Äô benefits.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,‚Äù Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, ‚ÄúShould we incorporate all policies of Meta while we‚Äôre at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I should try running the company with all of Meta‚Äôs policies,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúNo, probably not.‚Äù",970,116,2025-08-30 14:54:27,2025-09-25 02:30:14.293900

GOOGL,1n1i1vn,wallstreetbets,BitFarms $BITF High-Performance Computing Play,"**Strategic Shift to AI and HPC:** The company is accelerating its move into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. This strategic diversification beyond just Bitcoin mining is seen as a positive step for future growth and has been highlighted in analyst reports. Bitfarms has already announced a partnership with T5 Data Centers to develop its Panther Creek campus for HPC/AI

  
**On August 18, 2025, Bitfarms announced the appointment of Wayne Duso, a former Amazon Web Services (AWS) executive, to its Board of Directors**. This appointment is a significant development because of Bitfarms' strategic pivot towards high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Duso's extensive experience at AWS, where he helped scale and lead several businesses in data storage and cloud infrastructure, is seen as a major asset to this new direction.

Similarly, **Terawulf $WULF** stocks recent surge is primarily due to a major strategic shift from Bitcoin mining to providing high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. 

**Massive AI Hosting Deal with Fluidstack:** TeraWulf announced a 10-year agreement with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. This initial agreement is valued at approximately **$3.7 billion** and can potentially grow to **$8.7 billion** if extensions are exercised. 

**Google ($GOOGL)'s** recently announced providing a **$1.8 billion backstop** for Fluidstack's lease obligations and has taken an **8% equity stake** in TeraWulf

  
**TLDR:**  I'm expecting $BITF to sign a HPC deal in near future causing stock price to surge.

GOOGL,1npncdh,investing,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.",266,103,2025-09-24 20:38:02,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275485

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

My ""target"" Shiller PE is \~80 for 2026-2028, jumping to 300-1500 by 3032 depending on social and educational evolution being restructured by pressures from AI.",3,3,2025-09-23 23:45:25,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275499

GOOGL,1nnk8wj,investing,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	‚Ä¢	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	‚Ä¢	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	‚Ä¢	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	‚Ä¢	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	‚Ä¢	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	‚Ä¢	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	‚Ä¢	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They‚Äôre growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

	‚Ä¢	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	100% annual net income growth
	‚Ä¢	54% gross profit CAGR
	‚Ä¢	GMV +93% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Net margins improving each year
	‚Ä¢	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	‚Ä¢	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	‚Ä¢	A true ‚Äúsubscription/toll bridge‚Äù style business in the making.

‚∏ª

Loadstar (3482.T)
	‚Ä¢	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	‚Ä¢	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	‚Ä¢	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	‚Ä¢	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	‚Ä¢	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

‚∏ª

Good Life (2970.T)
	‚Ä¢	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Net income up 48% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 44% YoY
	‚Ä¢	ROE ~29%
	‚Ä¢	PE ~11
	‚Ä¢	Share buybacks in 2025
	‚Ä¢	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

‚∏ª

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	‚Ä¢	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	‚Ä¢	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	‚Ä¢	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	‚Ä¢	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	‚Ä¢	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds. With the U.S. looking stretched, diversifying into Japan here looks like a once-in-a-generation setup.",0,17,2025-09-22 11:46:48,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275526

GOOGL,1nmnmh3,investing,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, ‚Äúaccessible luxury‚Äù) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I‚Äôve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU‚Äôs demise, I thought ‚Äúoh course!‚Äù (hindsight‚Äôs easy, huh?) and began thinking who‚Äôs next? While already down bad this year, I can‚Äôt help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle‚Äôs Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don‚Äôt know where they can turn. I don‚Äôt trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with ‚Äúhealthy options‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh ingredients‚Äù, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they‚Äôve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clich√©d. Their complacency isn‚Äôt deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we‚Äôre at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we‚Äôve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we‚Äôre seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing‚Äôs for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",20,5,2025-09-21 09:34:11,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275543
GOOGL,1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited.

GOOGL,1njurb9,investing,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

GOOGL,1ni2rm2,investing,Financial advisor broker - should I fire,"I've been with the same advisor for the past 14 years, and my portfolio has done fairly well over the years. Have seen people with way more performance, but overall I've remained in the green (except for a few big downturns).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in.

GOOGL,1nhtsh0,investing,NYT: fewer companies going public because of cumbersome corporate governance rules driven by fear of shareholder lawsuits.,"[The Quiet Force Imperiling Our Booming Stock Market](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/opinion/stock-market-corporate-governance-ipo.html)

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations ‚Äî which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change ‚Äî are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",79,33,2025-09-15 18:24:40,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275578
GOOGL,1ned4dy,investing,Oracle phenomena - ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I‚Äôve been pretty skeptical about Oracle‚Äôs surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the ‚Äúbig AI‚Äù bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we‚Äôre seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, ‚Äúold guard‚Äù player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked.

I do think there is a hype in AI with both ignorant (in the good way) investors and CEOs just looking for money (Altman) or justifying investment in something that MAY pay off in a way they dont even know how to capitalize other than ""will change everything"". We are like what, 3 years down the road and nothing truly revolutionary has happened. I think yes, we do use AI in many things, but nothing groundbreaking such as Google's search algorithm that made it a powerhouse.

I'm wondering if in this context is wise just to sell off my SPY holdings and invest in a more balanced way in Industry specific ETFs (my broker here in Argentina offers a ""pack"" where it picks 12 industry specific ETFs, including IT, in a balanced fashion, no sector going above 15%).

GOOGL,1n29y2a,investing,"Starting investing at 23, any advice?","I have not done much, but so far,

\- $650 in Wealthfront (HYSA for emergency fund)

\- $1000 in Robinhood (ROTH Ira) (yes I know Fidelity is better but Robinhood's clean user interface attracted me in the beginning)

I may be missing a lot of more potential investments, but Im finishing up school so I do not have much money on me right now. I would rather not ask money from my parents but rather just keep throwing money into my accounts from part time.

Let me know if I should invest into anything else such as S&P 500, treasury bills, real estate.

Any knowledge that Google may not provide that you learned through your personal experiences will be INIFINTELY more valuable to me than anything else right now.

EDIT:

My dad has been supporting me financially for the longest time, but I cant keep asking him to send me money every time just for me to deposit.

He lives overseas and i'm not sure if he is able to transfer funds directly into my Robinhood.

Is there a way to link a foreign bank account into my robinhood, or am I the only person who is able to deposit?

I'll be asking him if he is able to deposit even like say $50 a month into my account, he is quite well off but it is my responsibility to grow the account, not his, but I would also love to feel a little safer for investments just so my parents will feel a little less stressed",3,18,2025-08-28 11:42:53,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275626
GOOGL,1n0zps0,investing,I think the market is undervalued,"If you look at the historical data points, it suggests that SPY is undervalued rather than overvalued. The reason I make this point is that EPS is growing at a faster rate relative to the historical average P/E ratio. Note: the historical data I‚Äôm referencing dates back to 1926.

The average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is¬†**17.97**.  
The average EPS growth rate of the S&P 500 is about¬†**5.5‚Äì6% per year**.  
The current P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is¬†**27.28**.  
The EPS growth rate of the S&P 500 since the second quarter is¬†**12%**.

So, if we equalize the P/E ratio relative to EPS growth with how fast companies are expanding, the P/E ratio could rise as high as¬†**35.82**, given today‚Äôs growth rates.

The reason I find this a compelling argument and why I believe it applies is that companies are not valued only on their present earnings, but also on their future potential. In today‚Äôs market, which is driven by quarter-to-quarter news, as long as EPS growth continues at this pace, a P/E of 27.28 is absolutely justifiable given historical data.

NOTE: It is possible for my numbers to be wrong since I am relying on Google AI Search, ChatGPT deep research, and historical charts. But if these figures are accurate, then I see a genuine reason to believe the market is undervalued rather than overvalued.",0,53,2025-08-26 22:18:16,2025-09-25 02:30:16.275632
GOOGL,1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

‚Ä¢ **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

‚Ä¢ **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

‚Ä¢ **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
‚Ä¢ AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
‚Ä¢ Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
‚Ä¢ More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
‚Ä¢ New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
‚Ä¢ Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
‚Ä¢ Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
‚Ä¢ Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
‚Ä¢ Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
‚Ä¢ Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
‚Ä¢ Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
‚Ä¢ Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
‚Ä¢ High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
‚Ä¢ Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
‚Ä¢ Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
‚Ä¢ Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
‚Ä¢ Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
‚Ä¢ Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
‚Ä¢ Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
‚Ä¢ Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
‚Ä¢ Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",88,62,2025-09-24 21:14:03,2025-09-25 02:30:18.161975

What I thought would happen next, is that I'd need to have cash in the account on the upcoming date September 29th in order to get the new ""ORSTED T"" shares.

But outside of Interactive Brokers, I cannot get the market price or information on these ORSTED-T units, for example Google Finance or Financial Times market data. This is problematic for me since I manage all my holdings in a Google Sheet.

Additionally, the IBKR message has popped up a second time about a voluntary CA Election. It says that of my remaining ORSTED-T holdings, I can further subscribe them to another election.

GOOGL,1nny89w,stocks,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you‚Äôre looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",1,16,2025-09-22 20:51:16,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162027
GOOGL,1nnpcoc,stocks,Can Google Avoid a Breakup Twice?,"In a landmark decision this month, a federal judge spared Google from a breakup proposed by the government to rein in the company‚Äôs monopoly in search.

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google‚Äôs monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema‚Äôs ultimate decision could disrupt the company‚Äôs $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

GOOGL,1nnk82c,stocks,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	‚Ä¢	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	‚Ä¢	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	‚Ä¢	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	‚Ä¢	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	‚Ä¢	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	‚Ä¢	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	‚Ä¢	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They‚Äôre growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

‚∏ª

CREAL (2998.T)
	‚Ä¢	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	‚Ä¢	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	100% annual net income growth
	‚Ä¢	54% gross profit CAGR
	‚Ä¢	GMV +93% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Net margins improving each year
	‚Ä¢	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	‚Ä¢	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	‚Ä¢	A true ‚Äúsubscription/toll bridge‚Äù style business in the making.

‚∏ª

Loadstar (3482.T)
	‚Ä¢	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	‚Ä¢	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	‚Ä¢	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	‚Ä¢	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	‚Ä¢	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

‚∏ª

Good Life (2970.T)
	‚Ä¢	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Net income up 48% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 44% YoY
	‚Ä¢	ROE ~29%
	‚Ä¢	PE ~11
	‚Ä¢	Share buybacks in 2025
	‚Ä¢	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

‚∏ª

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	‚Ä¢	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	‚Ä¢	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	‚Ä¢	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	‚Ä¢	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	‚Ä¢	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds. With the U.S. looking stretched, diversifying into Japan here looks like a once-in-a-generation setup.",82,84,2025-09-22 11:45:38,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162077
GOOGL,1nmnics,stocks,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, ‚Äúaccessible luxury‚Äù) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I‚Äôve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU‚Äôs demise, I thought ‚Äúoh course!‚Äù (hindsight‚Äôs easy, huh?) and began thinking who‚Äôs next? While already down bad this year, I can‚Äôt help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle‚Äôs Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don‚Äôt know where they can turn. I don‚Äôt think they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with ‚Äúhealthy options‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh ingredients‚Äù, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they‚Äôve made it to the top. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Now, they feel tired and clich√©d. Their complacency isn‚Äôt deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we‚Äôre at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we‚Äôve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. It feels like we‚Äôre seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. One thing‚Äôs for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",8,4,2025-09-21 09:27:06,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162102
GOOGL,1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that‚Äôs what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don‚Äôt even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody‚Äôs reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",36,38,2025-09-20 18:07:12,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162125
GOOGL,1nm2ecd,stocks,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can‚Äôt lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it‚Äôs even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I‚Äôm crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

GOOGL,1nlylxt,stocks,Why is using maximum margin to buy and hold long term a bad idea when the numbers say otherwise?,"Everyone always says using margin is a terrible idea, it‚Äôs super risky etc.  right now I have a $100,000 trading account, let‚Äôs say 5 years ago I used my full maximum margin to simply invest $300,000 to buy GOOGL ($200,000 of which would be from margin). Even after all the interest you would pay on the margin funds, I would practically be a millionaire.  

Let‚Äôs be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?  

Sure Google could or whatever company could be the next Enron and you lose it all, but that risk is no different than you taking out a big business loan to start a business and your business fails.  What am I missing?",0,51,2025-09-20 13:46:25,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162144

GOOGL,1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",111,57,2025-09-19 11:50:52,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162155

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by¬†Nvidia,¬†Microsoft¬†and¬†Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust¬†ruling¬†by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal¬†monopoly in search¬†and related advertising.

But Judge¬†Amit Mehta¬†decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President¬†Donald Trump¬†congratulated the company and¬†called¬†it ‚Äúa very good day.‚Äù

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google‚Äôs IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the¬†creation¬†of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was¬†named CEO¬†of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai‚Äôs latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up¬†helping¬†Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company‚Äôs hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google‚Äôs flagship suite of AI models.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1ne09jg,stocks,"$BYRN DD: It's Mispriced, and I think it'll pop by October 8th. I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company‚Äôs publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman‚Äôs Warehouse. They can‚Äôt tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don‚Äôt care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it‚Äôs working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I‚Äôm betting 30k shares that it‚Äôs going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)


Thank you regards for reading this far. The same fundamentals as any other slept-on stock applies to this one. Buy and hold, check the next interest report coming out on 09/15, etcetera. If any oldheads read this post, please fact check my ass. I'm trying to navigate this into as much profit as I can possibly take myself.

GOOGL,1nctxgv,stocks,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle¬†shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†$1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it¬†signed an agreement¬†with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to¬†Nvidia‚Äôs¬†graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google‚Äôs Gemini artificial intelligence models would¬†become available¬†on Oracle‚Äôs cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday‚Äôs close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

GOOGL,1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It‚Äôs survived wave after wave of ‚Äúthis app is dead‚Äù & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

GOOGL,1nbwetv,stocks,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,90,2025-09-08 18:54:56,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162330

Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google was fined almost ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

‚ÄúWhen markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,‚Äù EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. ‚ÄúTrue freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.‚Äù

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move ‚Äúimposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.‚Äù

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU‚ÄìUS trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc‚Äôs efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google‚Äôs adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company‚Äôs central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera‚Äôs predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a ‚Äúmandatory divestment‚Äù of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than ‚Ç¨8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",710,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162371

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Mahaney‚Äôs current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a ‚Äúbig win‚Äù for Apple.

‚ÄúThis has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they‚Äôve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,‚Äù he said.

In a¬†landmark case¬†filed in 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Google kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance.

GOOGL,1n6cctp,stocks,Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio,"Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!

I understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it‚Äôs my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven‚Äôt had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I‚Äôm debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

> Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker‚Äôs clientele. ‚ÄúCustomer A‚Äù made up 23% of total revenue, and ‚ÄúCustomer B‚Äù comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company‚Äôs second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That‚Äôs higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia‚Äôs top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

> The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia‚Äôs explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that ‚Äúlarge cloud service providers‚Äù made up about 50% of the company‚Äôs data center revenue. That‚Äôs important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia‚Äôs overall revenue in the second quarter. ‚ÄúWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,‚Äù Nvidia wrote in the filing.

> Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia. ‚ÄúWe see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 [cloud service provider] capex expectations,‚Äù wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock. But Nvidia‚Äôs Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It‚Äôs a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.",955,168,2025-08-28 20:30:41,2025-09-25 02:30:18.162489

GOOGL,1n1oftl,stocks,"Google has eliminated 35% of managers overseeing small teams in past year, exec says","Google¬†has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

‚ÄúRight now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports‚Äù than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to an audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. ‚ÄúSo a lot of fast progress there,‚Äù

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, ‚Äúinternal barriers‚Äù and Google‚Äôs culture after several recent rounds of layoffs,¬†buyouts¬†and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

‚ÄúWhen we look across our entire leadership population, that‚Äôs mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,‚Äù he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO¬†Sundar Pichai¬†weighed in, reiterating the need for the company ‚Äúto be more efficient as we scale up so we don‚Äôt solve everything with headcount.‚Äù

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year,¬†said¬†in October that she would push cost cuts ‚Äúa little further.‚Äù Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring,¬†asking¬†employees to do more with less.

MSFT,1nesqr3,wallstreetbets,"DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play","Hello fellow regards,

I am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk.¬†

Before we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.

* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.
* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.
* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.

This is just the start. There isn‚Äôt enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.

Now, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers ‚Äì their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).

I want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:

* What BITF don‚Äôt have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.
* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).
* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.

So, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.

Now moving on to my bulll thesis:

They have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania.¬†

* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.
* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 ‚Äì 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.
* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported. ¬†
* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.
* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation ‚Äì this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.
* It is a value play ‚Äì yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.
   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)
   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)

Can BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.

Have fun

Regards,

checazzo

MSFT,1ne8vin,wallstreetbets,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2‚Äô25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader ‚Äúunder study‚Äù pool).

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** ‚ÄúAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure‚Äù was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**.

[The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the ‚Äú**Begin Actual Construction**‚Äù definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn‚Äôt final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council‚Äôs dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there‚Äôs **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren‚Äôt there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA‚Äôs Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

MSFT,1nddyqw,wallstreetbets,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.

Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.

**Cloud revenue ratio**

* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio
* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5‚Äì12√ó

**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**

* Company | Market cap (we‚Äôre using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR
* CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9√ó
* NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53√ó

To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.

With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.

It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.

Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted
* Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted
* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap

**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**

* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr
* CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M
* NBIS | $105.1M | \~40‚Äì55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91‚Äì2.63M)

https://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE‚Äô25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ‚âà $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26‚Äì$1.30B** and FY‚Äô25 **$5.15‚Äì$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ‚âà $1.66‚Äì$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22‚Äì40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ‚âà $0.19‚Äì$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE‚Äô25 **ARR guidance $0.9‚Äì$1.1B** (**‚âà$0.225‚Äì$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

MSFT,1nda69a,wallstreetbets,$100K on BTBT Because the Market Doesn‚Äôt Understand it owns 74% of WYFI,"Everyone is talking about NBIS and its new mega contract with MSFT.

Me?  I‚Äôm focused on the next NBIS, which is BTBT.

The thesis is simple.  BTBT is trading at a massive discount to its intrinsic value right now.

Here is the math:

BTBT owns 121,252 ether in its treasury, valued today at ~$525 million.

BTBT also owns a 74% stake in WYFI, an AI Infrastructure/GPU cloud provider that it recently spun off in an IPO.  At $18.95, WYFI market cap is ~$717 million.  BTBT‚Äôs 74% stake = $530mm.

So thats $1.05 Billion in intrinsic value for BTBT when you combine its ether holdings and stake in WYFI.

What‚Äôs BTBT trading at?  $2.77/share or $890 million in market cap.  This is a 16% discount to its intrinsic value of $1.05 Billion.

Many Wall Street analysts from Needham to Macquarie have price targets on WYFI much higher ($25-$34/share).  Many analysts also have targets on ether that are much higher $10K+.

You do the math for what this could mean for BTBT.  The upside is legitimately insane.  The market is completely asleep on this massive opportunity but when people wake up, BTBT will absolutely soar.",179,65,2025-09-10 10:09:02,2025-09-25 02:30:23.297130

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying.

Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Sector would be cloud and infra. So $amzn, $googl $msft. Then neo clouds like $crwv ( coreweave).",126,218,2025-09-10 05:57:28,2025-09-25 02:30:24.714736

MSFT,1n32vqy,investing,"Hi, freshly starting investing into stocks. I need advice on the following potential portfolios. I am torn between multiple different versions.","Hello, I am a 21-year-old male investor from Australia using Pearler as my broker platform of choice. My primary goals are:

Long-term wealth accumulation (15-25+ year time horizon).
High growth, prioritizing capital appreciation.
A well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.
Financial Independence / Retire Early (FIRE), with an ambition to eventually have my portfolio generate enough passive income to cover at least some of my living expenses (e.g., rent or groceries).

I am looking for a second opinion on three potential portfolio allocations. My current portfolio looks really solid, but I've been considering multiple alternative drafts.
Please provide a detailed analysis of each portfolio, including an assessment of its strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for my stated goals. Pay close attention to how each portfolio's asset choices affect the trade-off between capital growth and passive income.

MSFT,1n1u5je,investing,Experience with AI-driven portfolio so far,"Hey everyone! I've decided to try something different and vibe-coded a portfolio management system. It's basically an LLM with a bunch of tools to design a portfolio for you according to your investment goal. I've been test-driving it for about 6 weeks, and here are my results so far.

The goal was to build a moderate risk portfolio with some crypto exposure.

Initially it gave me this:

AAPL 5%  
MSFT 5%  
BND 10%  
ICLN 5%  
QQQ 10%  
SCHD 10%  
VNQ 5%  
VTI 25%  
VXUS 15%  
ETH-USD, BTC-USD 5% each

it went about 4% up so far. I got a little lucky with massive jump in ETH, at which point it suggested to rotate some of the profits into SGOV/BND, and reduce crypto exposure in general, so I'm down to about 6% crypto total.

ICLN was a little surprising as a recommendation, considering the political climate, but it paid off so far, up about 7%. 

Probably lucky timing as well, since the market was up in general. Actually the only losing investment was BTC-USD, down about 5%.

The whole portfolio looks pretty conventional, which is probably not too surprising considering that LLM would likely give you middle-of-the-road advice.",0,4,2025-08-27 21:45:03,2025-09-25 02:30:24.714769

""Unlike typical cloud datacenters, which are optimized to run many smaller, independent workloads such as hosting websites, email or business applications, this datacenter is built to work as one massive AI supercomputer using a single flat networking interconnecting hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs.""

""Azure was the first cloud provider to bring online the NVIDIA GB200 server, rack and full datacenter clusters.""

""For the latest NVIDIA GB200 and GB300 deployments globally, at the rack level these GPUs communicate over NVLink and NVSwitch at terabytes per second, collapsing memory and bandwidth barriers.""

""These new AI datacenters are part of a global network of Azure AI datacenters, interconnected via our Wide Area Network (WAN). This isn‚Äôt just about one building, it‚Äôs about a distributed, resilient and scalable system that operates as a single, powerful AI machine. Our AI WAN is built with growth capabilities in AI-native bandwidth scales to enable large-scale distributed training across multiple, geographically diverse Azure regions, thus allowing customers to harness the power of a giant AI supercomputer.""

MSFT,1nnth5t,stocks,What's to stop AI companies from just continuing to invest in each other? Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

[**WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&p=d) \- Paramount/Skydance are preparing a bid for WBD, reportedly backed by Larry Ellison. This stock exploded around 10:30 PT yesterday, moving from $13.50 to $17. Currently I'm interested if we can continue momentum today (it's held up decently well).

More media sector consolidation, the last time we've seen something like this is the failed bid for Paramount (which later led to Paramount/Skydance). Obviously deal risk is the main concern here, if talks fall through or the rumor is refuted then we'll go back to original price.

[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d) \- OpenAI has received Microsoft‚Äôs approval to transition its for-profit arm, thus boosting strategic AI partnerships. This move essentially signals confidence in MSFT's continued collaboration with OpenAI and AI-driven growth and presumably means that they'll use MSFT products like Azure for their cloud compute. This happened afterhours yesterday, and moved the stock 2%.  MSFT has moved back slightly, not so interested in this unless we have a huge surge of volume off the open.

[**OPEN (OpenDoor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d) \- Stock price has gone gangbusters since the appointment of Kaz Nejatian, Shopify‚Äôs former COO, as the new CEO. We moved from 6->10 in the past 2 days, not interested in a long, maybe a short if the stock price goes parabolic to something like 15/20. Stock is pretty liquid (millions of shares every minute) so no concern with getting size if needed. It's also a meme stock, so we'll see how this turns out.

[**ORCL (Oracle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \- ORCL is selling off after one of the craziest earnings moves I've ever seen, but it's retraced back significantly from the $345 high.

MSFT,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don‚Äôt make money, they burn money, so it‚Äôs not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it‚Äôs really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it‚Äôs also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm‚Äôs hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it‚Äôs going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won‚Äôt be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.",50,28,2025-09-12 02:57:35,2025-09-25 02:30:26.408102

TSLA,1njcfnv,wallstreetbets,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B üöÄ)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B üöÄ)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

TSLA,1n8phu8,wallstreetbets,"2.8k to 50k, 1800% Returns Over the Summer","I started with 2.8k in AMD leaps back in February. They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began.



My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness.



I read about Donald Jr.‚Äôs new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me.



I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y‚Äôall seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I‚Äôm not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost.¬†



The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don‚Äôt even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there‚Äôs this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason.  



At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they‚Äôre even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I‚Äôm somehow at 50k.

Luckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. 

I kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time.

Options. The answer is always options. /yes, this is a joke  


(my last post got removed, ig for not being enough of a meme? or maybe my options joke? well, now it's full effort time, with emoji reactions and making sure I fully identify jokes... hey, I'll even throw in educational backstory)

educational backstory: year to date losses were from call options in $SOFI. Those would have fully recovered, if you take a look at YTD performance. I'd been doing quite well with $SOFI in my 401(k), but of course, the moment I liquidated my ever-rolling $SOFI calls in Robinhood (to evaluate my next move), that's when $SOFI mooned, and I figured it was a dead cat bounce, so I missed out. So I've since returned to an old favorite, which is what is driving the portfolio value difference between each screenshot taken within minutes of each other‚Äìlots of $VFC call options that have been on a tear lately (I'm sorry‚ÄìI like en dashes, I'm not AI).

Now for that All-Time loss story. A bit of that was from learning options, but most of those losses, iirc, were from early stage healthcare stocks, a movie ticket service, and a major, now infamous, Indian streaming company that had some loyal followers on forums. I abandoned my $TSLA call options just before it went onto massive gains years ago, and went all in on the streamer.  Actually did seem legit from my DD, because they were merging with a notable American studio that had produced some solid blockbusters. But hey, guess what? Months after that merger went through, the American studio, iirc, sued the streaming platform and they separated. The rest is history. Also tried out a healthcare company with a solid product portfolio and management that had good results on previous ventures. Like a lot of early medical companies seem to though, they used the stock like a piggybank and kept issuing more and more shares. It didn't matter how well trials were doing or what cleared the FDA, because any gain would be suppressed by another issuance and a fair bit of M&A and management bonuses that were funded by shares.

I don't know what it is though. When I'm self-managing my 401(k), I'm very responsible and have solid, market-beating gains. When I open up Robinhood, it's like I need to rep my WSB cred and yolo on some hair-brained idea.

So now I'm on my redemption arc of trying to treat my Robinhood account a bit more like my 401(k).",395,47,2025-08-29 20:56:06,2025-09-25 02:30:30.278531

This suggests a decline in local demand, which might have an impact on commodities, multinational corporations (AAPL, TSLA, NKE), and international commerce.

I'm not saying this is the start of a new trend where Elon keeps buying TSLA shares, but he HAS stopped selling TSLA shares for about 3 years now.

TSLA,1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks‚Ä¶ are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn‚Äôt new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren‚Äôt perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That‚Äôs a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn‚Äôt just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here‚Äôs the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

- If orange man dies, Vance becomes president. This propels PLTR to be the president‚Äôs stock, just as TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency. Tesla kept going up, until tensions between trump and musk were getting bad.

The problem is I‚Äôm a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I‚Äôm rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500‚Äôs worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you‚Äôre a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don‚Äôt call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD‚Äôs slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn‚Äôt have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren‚Äôt taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre undervalued‚Äù or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don‚Äôt care either way because I think they‚Äôll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said ‚ÄúTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green‚Äôs imaginings.

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok‚Äôs walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",91,61,2025-09-19 14:03:11,2025-09-25 02:30:37.130284

AMZN,1nn2eed,investing,Would you keep 40% of your portfolio in AMZN to avoid capital gains tax?,"I've vested Amazon shares over the years and I sell to cover then leave them in AMZN. I have that portfolio of 100% AMZN, and another one that I actively manage which is about 40% SPY, 20% bonds and gold, and 40% in individual stocks. 

I ran the numbers and, when both portfolios are combined, 40% of my holdings are AMZN. 

My AMZN portfolio is +30% overall. I know I'm overweight in AMZN due to the shares given to me. I want to sell about half of the AMZN shares and put that money into SPY and bonds. 

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares. 

Given the tax implications, what's a sound strategy I should do? Continue holding all AMZN in my one port? Sell a portion and redistribute?

AMZN,1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I‚Äôm bullish on the company and we‚Äôre plenty diversified so we‚Äôre holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I‚Äôd sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That‚Äôs just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that‚Äôs not bad. 




Here‚Äôs where it‚Äôs free money:


1. I‚Äôll get this out of the way: I‚Äôm completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It‚Äôs been an underperformed and was ‚Äúfree‚Äù to begin with. I‚Äôm not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I‚Äôve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn‚Äôt have many unexpected upside moves, it‚Äôs just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I‚Äôm just not particularly worried about and it seems I‚Äôd be able to buy back in. I‚Äôm genuinely open to advice if I‚Äôm fucking something up, but I don‚Äôt think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,2025-09-25 02:30:39.275631

Long-term wealth accumulation (15-25+ year time horizon).
High growth, prioritizing capital appreciation.
A well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.
Financial Independence / Retire Early (FIRE), with an ambition to eventually have my portfolio generate enough passive income to cover at least some of my living expenses (e.g., rent or groceries).

I am looking for a second opinion on three potential portfolio allocations. My current portfolio looks really solid, but I've been considering multiple alternative drafts.
Please provide a detailed analysis of each portfolio, including an assessment of its strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for my stated goals. Pay close attention to how each portfolio's asset choices affect the trade-off between capital growth and passive income.

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account. How do you all decide to take profit (minus life changing choices events like buying a house, medical or other type of emergency, etc etc)?

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it‚Äôs my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven‚Äôt had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I‚Äôm debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

AMZN,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here‚Äôs how her top positions look right now:
	‚Ä¢	NVDA ‚Äì +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	‚Ä¢	NFLX ‚Äì +$418.00 (+458.53%)

	‚Ä¢	TSLA ‚Äì +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	‚Ä¢	K (Kellogg) ‚Äì +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she‚Äôs outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she‚Äôs beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she‚Äôs actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I‚Äôm hiring them to manage my accounts.

NVDA,1npnj6l,wallstreetbets,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I‚Äôm picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

‚Ä¢  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies‚Äîvolume‚Äôs solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

‚Ä¢  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

‚Ä¢  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds‚Äîpartnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

‚Ä¢  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume‚Äîtechnical setup for extension if momentum holds.

‚Ä¢  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact‚Äîoptimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I‚Äôd say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

NVDA,1nk5cl8,wallstreetbets,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
¬†
Overall
¬†
‚Ä¢PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
‚Ä¢Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
‚Ä¢Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
‚Ä¢Scope: Product collaboration‚Äînot a foundry manufacturing deal
¬†
Why it matters
¬†
‚Ä¢Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA‚Äôs fastest-growing AI platforms.
¬†

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B üöÄ)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B üöÄ)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

NVDA,1nhzrer,wallstreetbets,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.",286,135,2025-09-15 22:09:49,2025-09-25 02:30:44.454662

NVDA,1ne8vin,wallstreetbets,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2‚Äô25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader ‚Äúunder study‚Äù pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** ‚ÄúAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure‚Äù was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the ‚Äú**Begin Actual Construction**‚Äù definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn‚Äôt final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council‚Äôs dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there‚Äôs **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren‚Äôt there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA‚Äôs Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

I don't believe in technical analysis or colorful lines but since the drop, the stock has been bouncing off resistance at $180 until it broke through on Thursday. On Friday it continued up while the rest of the market and tech sector sold off. Nothing about the core business has changed and I believe the selloff was bigly overdone, so over the course of the next month or two we'll see a move back to the $270 range. Two upcoming catalysts will likely help with that, MNDY speaks at the Goldman Sachs conference Sep 10th, and they're hosting the 2025 Elevate conference in NYC on Sep 17th-18th. Goldman Sachs maintains a BUY rating and $270 PT on the stock, and I expect we'll get more information about the AI hyped digital workers and product powerups the company has been teasing during Elevate.

Also Congressman Bresnahan, the guy who said he'd ban trading in congress, bought MNDY twice this year alongside his other tech purchases NVDA and SNOW.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",1835,389,2025-08-29 11:36:32,2025-09-25 02:30:44.454788

NVDA,1nnti8f,investing,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. 

Just my opinion would love peoples thoughts.

LMK if you made a better return on stocks than BTC or if you think my idea is flawed?",0,55,2025-09-22 17:53:39,2025-09-25 02:30:46.859397
NVDA,1nnpoxo,investing,Is AI the Future of the Stock Market and Investing? And is it Smart to Invest in AI now or in a Few Months?,"I can‚Äôt wrap my head around AI and how it will impact the future of the Stock Market and investing. AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day. People are starting to use AI more and more in their day to day lives, however many companies are starting to incorporate AI into their systems and software to help make them generate more money. I do believe AI is the ‚ÄúNext Big Thing‚Äù when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand. I have a TFSA open (opened January 2024, and I have invested the maximum allocated limit ($7000 CAD a year) I have invested all of the money that is in my TFSA into ETF‚Äôs as it is one of the safest ways to invest and watch the money grow rather than depreciate because of inflation. In January 2026 when I can invest another $7000; I want to invest it all into AI. I was thinking of putting $3500 into TSMc and $3500 into NVDA. Both of these companies have been doing very well, and I do believe they will continue to do so. Is this a fair statement; and is it smart to invest in AI? I have played it safe in the last few years with putting all of my savings into ETF‚Äôs, but now I want to take a bigger risk with the possibility of great return.

But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|
|:-|:-|:-|

|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**‚àí US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|

|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

I am looking for a second opinion on three potential portfolio allocations. My current portfolio looks really solid, but I've been considering multiple alternative drafts.
Please provide a detailed analysis of each portfolio, including an assessment of its strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for my stated goals. Pay close attention to how each portfolio's asset choices affect the trade-off between capital growth and passive income. 

I would also appreciate a final verdict on which portfolio is best for a young investor with these specific goals, as well as any general advice on rebalancing or asset management.

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

NVDA,1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks‚Ä¶ are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn‚Äôt new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren‚Äôt perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That‚Äôs a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn‚Äôt just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here‚Äôs the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

NVDA,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don‚Äôt make money, they burn money, so it‚Äôs not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it‚Äôs really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it‚Äôs also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm‚Äôs hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it‚Äôs going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won‚Äôt be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.",51,28,2025-09-12 02:57:35,2025-09-25 02:30:49.614098

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

NVDA,1n3dv7e,stocks,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia‚Äôs H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",374,149,2025-08-29 17:35:24,2025-09-25 02:30:49.614121

NVDA,1n1s58d,stocks,NVDA 2Q26 Earnings Result,"**Earnings per share**: $1.05, adjusted, up 54% from a year ago

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.¬†NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA‚Äôs outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",478,195,2025-08-27 20:26:38,2025-09-25 02:30:49.614142

META,1np10yv,wallstreetbets,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it‚Äôs overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn‚Äôt run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company‚Äôs robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)‚Äîa segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, ‚ÄúWe process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,‚Äù underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD‚Äôs platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD‚Äôs scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth‚Äîespecially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

My positions included. This is not financial advice. Invest or not, at your own risk.",36,34,2025-09-24 02:47:55,2025-09-25 02:30:53.025552
META,1nl4g6m,wallstreetbets,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you‚Äôve seen my last couple posts I‚Äôve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I‚Äôm a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I‚Äôm rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500‚Äôs worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you‚Äôre a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don‚Äôt call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD‚Äôs slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn‚Äôt have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren‚Äôt taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre undervalued‚Äù or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don‚Äôt care either way because I think they‚Äôll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said ‚ÄúTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green‚Äôs imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok‚Äôs walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",88,61,2025-09-19 14:03:11,2025-09-25 02:30:53.025579

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

META,1nhanqj,wallstreetbets,"+600k this weeks, thanks GLXY","Galaxy Digital was getting crazy undervalued the last couple weeks. Tons of extremely positive news on both the crypto side of their business and data center side. Looking to roll these into 2026's when they should get a portion of their 2.7GW understudy approved by ERCOT (on top of the 800MW they already have approved/leased) and leased out to a big hyperscaler like Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta.

If the full 3.5GW is approved and leased out at the same terms as their current CoreWeave deal, Galaxy could generate ~$5.25B/year in average annual revenues at 90% EBITDA margins (market cap Friday was ~$11B (@~$30/share), subtract their $3B balance sheet and you get ~$8B in equity value attributable to their crypto and data center business).

Think a fair price in the short term is $54/share (w/no additional approvals) and then gets into the $100's of dollars / share range if they can execute on their 3.5GWs + future power/site acquisitions.

I truly believe this is only the beginning of the journey and we are still so early. Just this week the senior management of the company met with 50+ institutions and I‚Äôm expecting we catch a bid in Q4, please keep in mind Galaxy has only been listed on the NASDAQ since the middle of May.

There are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

It's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.

META,1n9n3mt,wallstreetbets,Snap (SNAP): Acquisition Target or Dead Money?,"So Snap‚Äôs stock has been in free fall ‚Äî down over 90% from the $80 peak in 2021, now sitting around $7. At the same time, the company still has ~469M daily active users, mostly Gen Z, who treat it like an operating system for their social life (AR lenses, Bitmoji, Maps, AI assistant, etc).

Here‚Äôs the case for why people think Snap is a buyout candidate:
	‚Ä¢	Valuation: Trading at one of the lowest price-to-sales multiples in social media. Dirt cheap compared to Meta, Pinterest, or TikTok‚Äôs implied value.
	‚Ä¢	User Base: Half a billion DAUs is nothing to sneeze at. Extremely sticky with younger demographics.
	‚Ä¢	Strategic Fit: Big tech (Google, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Netflix, etc) could bolt this onto their ecosystem. Rumors of Alphabet interest pre-IPO have floated before.
	‚Ä¢	Market Sentiment: Polls show a lot of retail/institutional investors believe Snap gets bought out in the next 1‚Äì2 years.

But here‚Äôs the catch:
	‚Ä¢	Founder Control: Evan Spiegel & Bobby Murphy still hold ~96% of the voting power. If they don‚Äôt want to sell, it doesn‚Äôt matter how attractive the numbers look.
	‚Ä¢	Current Strategy: Snap‚Äôs been on offense, buying up smaller apps like Saturn (popular in U.S. high schools). That‚Äôs not what you do if you‚Äôre prepping for a sale.
	‚Ä¢	Execution Risk: Advertising headwinds, competition from TikTok/Instagram, and weak monetization continue to crush the stock.

TL;DR: On paper, Snap looks like one of the most attractive acquisition targets in tech cheap, highly engaged user base, potential fit for multiple buyers. But with founder control and ongoing internal growth moves, it‚Äôs far from a guaranteed outcome. If anything, it‚Äôs a speculative play on either a turnaround or someone eventually forcing their hand.

META,1n43n2j,wallstreetbets,"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google¬†has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

‚ÄúRight now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports‚Äù than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. ‚ÄúSo a lot of fast progress there.‚Äù

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, ‚Äúinternal barriers‚Äù and Google‚Äôs culture after several recent rounds of layoffs,¬†buyouts¬†and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

‚ÄúWhen we look across our entire leadership population, that‚Äôs managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,‚Äù he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO¬†Sundar Pichai¬†weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company ‚Äúto be more efficient as we scale up so we don‚Äôt solve everything with headcount.‚Äù

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year,¬†said¬†in October that she would push cost cuts ‚Äúa little further.‚Äù Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring,¬†asking¬†employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented ‚ÄúVoluntary Exit Program‚Äù offers. They‚Äôve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year.¬†

Fiona Cicconi, Google‚Äôs chief people officer, said at last week‚Äôs meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

‚ÄúThis has been actually quite successful,‚Äù she said, adding ‚ÄúI think we can continue it.‚Äù

Pichai said the company executed the¬†voluntary buyouts¬†after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of work that‚Äôs gone into implementing the VEP program, and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve done it,‚Äù Pichai said. ‚ÄúIt gives people agency, and I‚Äôm glad to see it‚Äôs worked out well.‚Äù

‚ÄòWanting a career break‚Äô

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually quite interesting to see who‚Äôs taking a VEP, and it‚Äôs people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,‚Äù she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs¬†hurt morale¬†as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet‚Äôs shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to¬†Meta‚Äôs¬†‚Äúrecharge,‚Äù a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

‚ÄúWe have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that ‚Äî resting and recharging,‚Äù said Alexandra Maddison, Google‚Äôs senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very confident that our current offering is competitive,‚Äù Maddison said.

Meta didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies‚Äô benefits.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,‚Äù Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, ‚ÄúShould we incorporate all policies of Meta while we‚Äôre at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I should try running the company with all of Meta‚Äôs policies,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúNo, probably not.‚Äù",970,116,2025-08-30 14:54:27,2025-09-25 02:30:53.025677

META,1n21jmh,wallstreetbets,CRWV BULLISH DD,"Alright listen up you red crayon eaters. Because it is time to turn your -90% portfolios to +400%.

CoreWeave has been bashed in recent times due to mounting debts. But not many billionaires would advise you to keep emergency cash in fact, borrowing is the meta to becoming rich. The printer never stops, you just need to outgrow inflation and grab all that newly minted benjamins. If CoreWeave was a soy boy, they'd be delisted in 2 years. To win, you need to take risks, and CoreWeave has done exactly that.

Sure their business model is absolutely asset intensive but 99% of men love assets. But enough yappers. Because I will show you some calculations on the breakdown on their CAPEX, and estimated OPEX.

Before we begin, as with most bullshit corporate documents, I will outline assumptions based on Gemini-able, GPT-able, GROX-able information. We will be assuming land cost, PUE, construction costs, and IT costs in estimates. Utility prices will be taken off latest available information off the net.

CoreWeave has reported that they are on track to deliver up to 900MW in their 2025 guidance. This is almost double their current active capacity, sitting at 470MW. But oh boy those datacenters they are gonna erect will give many Wallstreet Buffets wannabe ED. Sure, datacenters are expensive but the premium of these bad boy Grace and Blackwell supercomputers can command gives me viagra on crack and Redbull. The following calculations are all based in USD.

**First up CAPEX (on 430MW)**

Hard Construction Costs: $18M per Megawatt  
Soft Construction Costs: 20% of Hard Construction Costs  
Land Required/MW: \~550m^(2)¬†(5,920ft^(2)¬†for retards)  
Land Cost/m^(2)¬†: $20  
Jensen Baby Cost per GB300 NVL72: \~$3M (each takes up 130kW)  
Assume 80% Fit-out of GB300 NVL72: 2,646 GB300 NVL72s = $7,939M  
Other supporting racks/IT (20% fit-out): $5M/MW = $430M

**Total CAPEX = $7,939M + $430M + $4.73M + $7,740M + $1,548M = $17,661.73M**

**Next up OPEX (on 430MW)**

Total IT Power = 430MW  
Assumed PUE = 1.2  
Total Power Consumption = 516MW  
Commercial Power Price = $0.1185/kWh  
Total Cost for Energy = $535.64M/year

Estimated Water Consumption = 2m^(3)/hour/MW  
Commercial Water Price = $6/m^(3)  
Total Price of Water = $45.21M/year

Asset Maintenance for IT (including depreciation): 5% of IT Cost/year  
Total Maintenance cost for IT = $418.45M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Electrical Systems: 3% of System Cost/year (41% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $95.20M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Mechanical Systems: 4% of System Cost/year (25% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $77.40M/year

Headcount: estimated 806, prorated  
Estimated average payroll/head: $150,000  
Total payroll: $120.9M/ year

**Total Annual OPEX = $535.64M + $45.21M + $418.45M + $95.20M + $77.40M + $120.9M = $1292.80M (excl interest expenses and depreciation)**

Considering CRWV announced capital expenditure of $20 \~ $23 billion, probably likely includes financing leases and acquisition of Core Scientific. But what the hell do they mean?

Based on earlier Q2 earnings suggests, the revenue per Megawatt is \~$11M. If we scale that up without considering any premium for the GB200/GB300, the revenue for just this 430MW is \~$4.73B, logically speaking, we might be looking at almost $5.4B instead.

Tech refresh cycles that is gonna be 3/4 years for these chips, that's fair. But these chips don't just go obsolete / worthless because some accountant deems their ""useful"" life a certain number of years. They can be repurposed, if they retain even 30% of their value in 3 years, the ROI will look even better, and eventually, D&A becomes very misleading and conservative. The buildings and infrastructure are good for 10, 20 years so retrofitting them at fraction of the initial construction costs to suit future needs.

Considering EBITDA, the ROI is as low as 4.4 years, and based on GAAP, the ROI could be 10 years (4 years cycle). And if we consider 30% resale value of these chips at end of 4 years, the ROI can be 8.7 years.

Currently, the FY25 guidance are reporting a mix of Hopper racks and maybe just a quarter of GB200/GB300. As CRWV gain more contracts using GB200 & GB300, and if they can grab and monopolize much of the available Blackwell chips, CRWV can command a higher premium. NVDA's stake in CRWV allows them to get priority access to latest chips, and they are very likely to be first to deploy the Vera Rubin slated to launch in 2026.

The whole AI shenanigans is still at the infant stages, all these large language models is really just the beginning. CRWV having 2.2GW of contracted capacity after acquiring Core Scientific is a calculated and strategic step to ensure they have room to grow at the pace they want to meet the demand they see.

Please do fact check my numbers if you have actual industry knowledge in the US, but they should be in the higher range. I highly believe actual numbers are even more optimistic.

**TLDR:**¬†CoreWeave is basically lighting money on fire today so it can sell compute at premium tomorrow. Their $20‚Äì23B capex plan is insane scale, but it checks out: racks of $3M GB200/GB300, $18M/MW concrete palaces, and power bills that could run a small country.

Yes, depreciation nukes GAAP, but that‚Äôs just accounting cosplay ‚Äî the GPUs don‚Äôt turn to dust after 3 years, they still earn or can be resold. Interest costs are a real drag, but adjusted EBITDA margins (\~60%+) show the core biz is printing.

The risk? Expansion outpaces demand or tech cycles compress faster than resale value. The upside? CRWV has Nvidia‚Äôs golden ticket, first dibs on new silicon, and 2.2GW of contracted capacity locked. Revenue will double, as a low hanging fruit next year.

Numbers go brrr, depreciation makes GAAP cry, but the growth story is very real.

META,1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that‚Äôs what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don‚Äôt even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody‚Äôs reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",6,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,2025-09-25 02:30:54.501017

Abstract

We provide data and code that successfully reproduces nearly all cross-
sectional stock return predictors. Our 319 characteristics draw from pre-
vious meta-studies, but we differ by comparing our t-stats to the original
papers‚Äô results. For the 161 characteristics that were clearly significant in
the original papers, 98% of our long-short portfolios find t-stats above 1.96.
For the 44 characteristics that had mixed evidence, our reproductions find
t-stats of 2 on average. A regression of reproduced t-stats on original long-
short t-stats finds a slope of 0.90 and an R 2 of 83%. Mean returns are mono-
tonic in predictive signals at the characteristic level. The remaining 114
characteristics were insignificant in the original papers or are modifica-
tions of the originals created by Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2020). These remain-
ing characteristics are almost always significant if the original characteristic
was also significant.",2,1,2025-08-28 23:11:53,2025-09-25 02:30:54.501103

META,1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

‚Ä¢ **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

‚Ä¢ **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

‚Ä¢ **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
‚Ä¢ AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
‚Ä¢ Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
‚Ä¢ More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
‚Ä¢ New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
‚Ä¢ Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
‚Ä¢ Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
‚Ä¢ Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
‚Ä¢ Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
‚Ä¢ Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
‚Ä¢ Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
‚Ä¢ Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
‚Ä¢ High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
‚Ä¢ Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
‚Ä¢ Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
‚Ä¢ Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
‚Ä¢ Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
‚Ä¢ Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
‚Ä¢ Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
‚Ä¢ Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
‚Ä¢ Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",83,62,2025-09-24 21:14:03,2025-09-25 02:30:56.618151

META,1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that‚Äôs what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don‚Äôt even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody‚Äôs reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",39,38,2025-09-20 18:07:12,2025-09-25 02:30:56.618190

META,1nlf722,stocks,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Krak√≥w, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC‚Äôs total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social‚Äôs strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout‚Äôs competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It‚Äôs moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

What‚Äôs do you guys think about Sprout Social?",5,2,2025-09-19 20:54:37,2025-09-25 02:30:56.618227
META,1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",113,57,2025-09-19 11:50:52,2025-09-25 02:30:56.618231

META,1njv8wk,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company‚Äôs first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC¬†report¬†in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses¬†appeared¬†on Meta‚Äôs YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company‚Äôs audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental¬†Orion augmented reality glasses¬†that the company revealed at last year‚Äôs Connect event.¬†Orion¬†can overlay 3D visuals over a person‚Äôs real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

‚ÄúThese are glasses with the classic style that you‚Äôd expect from Ray-Ban, but they‚Äôre the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn‚Äôt block a person‚Äôs view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that¬†went on sale¬†in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person‚Äôs temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company‚Äôs original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version¬†released¬†in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company‚Äôs Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta‚Äôs partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

META,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don‚Äôt make money, they burn money, so it‚Äôs not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it‚Äôs really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it‚Äôs also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm‚Äôs hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it‚Äôs going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won‚Äôt be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.",46,28,2025-09-12 02:57:35,2025-09-25 02:30:56.618284
META,1nd8ojp,stocks,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing?

META,1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It‚Äôs survived wave after wave of ‚Äúthis app is dead‚Äù & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

Then, whatever position you had went down 10-35%. And all of a sudden it's harder to justify selling.

Now think about the overall stock market right now. How would you feel if you sold your positions today?

META,1n6cctp,stocks,Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio,"Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!

I understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it‚Äôs my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven‚Äôt had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I‚Äôm debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

NFLX,1nij58k,wallstreetbets,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it‚Äôs Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok‚Äôs US assets. If you think Larry‚Äôs not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY‚Äôs content library, you‚Äôve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers‚Äô screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   * ¬†PSKY‚Äôs market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney‚Äôs balance sheet.

**I‚Äôm no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER.¬†

NFLX,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here‚Äôs how her top positions look right now:
	‚Ä¢	NVDA ‚Äì +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	‚Ä¢	NFLX ‚Äì +$418.00 (+458.53%)

	‚Ä¢	TSLA ‚Äì +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	‚Ä¢	K (Kellogg) ‚Äì +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she‚Äôs outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she‚Äôs beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she‚Äôs actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I‚Äôm hiring them to manage my accounts.
