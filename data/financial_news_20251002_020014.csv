Are We Alone? NASA’s Habitable Worlds Observatory Aims to Find Out,"The Habitable Worlds Observatory is poised to tell us whether Earth-like planets are common—if it can get off the ground

It’s a sweltering Tuesday in Washington, D.C., the kind of day that stretches the definition of Earth as a “habitable” planet. But on an eighth-floor terrace near the U.S. Capitol building, dozens of people are outside anyway, talking and watching as passersby dart between pools of shade on the sticky streets below. Besides the heat, the onlookers are sweating something else, too—an audacious project to learn, at last, whether we have any neighbors living on Earth-like planets in our neck of the Milky Way.

Giorgio Armani’s will shocked the fashion world — here’s why your final wishes should never be a surprise,"Iconic Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani kept tight control of the brand he founded 50 years ago. He never took the company public and remained the sole major shareholder until his death on Sept. 4 at the age of 91.

The Future of Labor in Retail | Marshall Fisher and Santiago Gallino,"Transcript

Understanding Retail Labor in the Grocery Industry

Dan Loney: We are at an interesting time in the labor markets. The economy is pretty strong, but technology is playing a larger role in the day-to-day operations. How to manage a staff plays a big part in the success of the firm. A recent report by two Wharton professors looks at the state of retail labor using the grocery industry as the main example.

Pleasure to be joined by Marshall Fisher, who’s a professor of operations, information and decisions here at the Wharton School, and also Santiago Gallino, who’s an associate professor of operations, information and decisions as well as an associate professor of marketing here.

Transient juvenile demyelination impairs maturation and function of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex,"Recent studies have highlighted axonal myelination as a common feature of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons throughout the cerebral cortex. However, the precise function of PV interneuron myelination remains incompletely understood. In this study, we used the cuprizone model of demyelination in mice to investigate how PV interneuron myelination might influence their neuronal physiology. Specifically, we examined whether impairing myelination from postnatal day 21 onwards, during a critical neurodevelopmental period of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), can affect PV interneuron maturation and function. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to examine intrinsic properties of PV interneurons in the PFC, we found that juvenile demyelination in mice induced robust alterations of PV interneuro",Plos.org,2025-09-30T14:00:00Z,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003421,2025-10-01 22:31:33.817506,
Optimization of echinococcosis control measures based on system dynamics,"This study aimed to provide strategies to optimize the prevention and control measures of echinococcosis in Gansu Province. Based on the transmission mechanism of echinococcosis, a System Dynamics (SD) model of echinococcosis in Gansu Province was established using Vensim software. Through this model, parameters such as vaccination coverage, domestic dog deworming coverage, slaughter management level, and health education level were adjusted to predict the changing trends in the number of human cases and infected sheep. The results showed that the number of human cases was most sensitive to the adjustment of health education level, followed by changes to vaccination coverage.

Top 5 Upgrades:

Morgan Stanley upgraded Celsius Holdings (CELH) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $70, up from $61. Brand Celsius has returned to growth following last year's share slowdown and the firm expects further improvement with much easier comps from December through early June, says the firm, which sees another leg up in the stock to be driven by a greater than expected reacceleration in topline growth.

Ottawa denies Marineland request to export its remaining beluga whales to China,"Ottawa has denied a request from Marineland to send its remaining beluga whales to China.

Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson says the federal government will not grant an export permit to ship the 30 whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom aquarium.

Thompson says approving the request would mean a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment for the whales.

She says the decision is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, made entertainment shows illegal and forbade breeding.

Twenty whales have died at Marineland since 2019 and the 30 that remain are the last captive whales in Canada.

Marineland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OPEC+ panel stresses need for full compliance with oil output limits,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Alex Lawler

LONDON (Reuters) -An OPEC+ panel stressed the need for achieving full compliance with oil output agreements and extra output cuts that some members are required to make to compensate for earlier exceeding quotas at a meeting on Wednesday, OPEC said in a statement.

The online meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, started at about 1230 GMT.

The JMMC retains the authority to convene additional meetings or request a full meeting of OPEC+ if needed, the statement said. It does not hold decision-making authority over OPEC+ production levels.

OPEC+ in April reversed its strategy of output cuts and has already raised quotas by more ",Yahoo! Finance,2025-10-01T14:20:05Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-panel-stresses-full-compliance-142005085.html,2025-10-01 22:37:05.603269,-0.01960784313725494

It's the metric most business owners obsess over, the one that looks great on a chart or in a pitch deck. But here's the catch: business buyers don't reward revenue, they reward business value. The smaller businesses that command the highest price when sold aren't the ones with the biggest revenue. They're the ones built to run without the founder, with systems, contracts, and recurring income that make growth predictable.

Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?,"Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?





Coffee growers are dealing with a lot right now. Most immediately, the Trump administration's tariffs, which threaten their sales, add to the ongoing challenges of pests and diseases for coffee production. In the longer term, experts say the coffee industry can't continue with business as usual. Growers face a waning labor force, and the areas where coffee can reliably grow are poised to shrink dramatically. While your morning cup isn't going away anytime soon, it could become more expensive — and could taste different, too. In honor of International Coffee Day on Oct. 1, we're taking stock of the world of coffee and what to expect in the years to come.

Celebrate your bike's scratches and turn them into art with this ancient Japanese craft | BikeRadar,"Bumps, scrapes, and scratches are an inevitability of bike ownership.

Goldfinger is a metallic paint-like compound originally manufactured for the art world by UK-based company Daler-Rowney. It’s designed to fill scrapes and scratches with a gold or silver finish, highlighting rather than concealing them.

The process is similar to kintsugi – or 'golden joinery' – the Japanese craft of repairing broken pottery with lacquer mixed with powdered gold, silver or platinum. It’s celebrated as a craft that highlights wear, rather than hiding it.

Ottawa denies Marineland request to export its remaining beluga whales to China,"Ottawa has denied a request from Marineland to send its remaining beluga whales to China.

Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson says the federal government will not grant an export permit to ship the 30 whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom aquarium.

Thompson says approving the request would mean a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment for the whales.

She says the decision is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, made entertainment shows illegal and forbade breeding.

Twenty whales have died at Marineland since 2019 and the 30 that remain are the last captive whales in Canada.

Marineland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Why Growing Revenue Won't Guarantee A Bigger Exit When Selling,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Growing revenue feels like progress. It's the metric most business owners obsess over, the one that looks great on a chart or in a pitch deck. But here's the catch: business buyers don't reward revenue, they reward business value.

OPEC+ panel stresses need for full compliance with oil output limits,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Alex Lawler

LONDON (Reuters) -An OPEC+ panel stressed the need for achieving full compliance with oil output agreements and extra output cuts that some members are required to make to compensate for earlier exceeding quotas at a meeting on Wednesday, OPEC said in a statement.

The online meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, started at about 1230 GMT.

The JMMC retains the authority to convene additional meetings or request a full meeting of OPEC+ if needed, the statement said. It does not hold decision-making authority over OPEC+ production levels.

OPEC+ in April reversed its strategy of output cuts and has already raised quotas by more ",Yahoo! Finance,2025-10-01T14:20:05Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opec-panel-stresses-full-compliance-142005085.html,2025-10-01 22:41:01.580109,-0.01960784313725494

Coffee growers are dealing with a lot right now. Most immediately, the Trump administration's tariffs, which threaten their sales, add to the ongoing challenges of pests and diseases for coffee production. In the longer term, experts say the coffee industry can't continue with business as usual. Growers face a waning labor force, and the areas where coffee can reliably grow are poised to shrink dramatically. While your morning cup isn't going away anytime soon, it could become more expensive — and could taste different, too. In honor of International Coffee Day on Oct. 1, we're taking stock of the world of coffee and what to expect in the years to come.

Ottawa denies Marineland request to export its remaining beluga whales to China,"Ottawa has denied a request from Marineland to send its remaining beluga whales to China.

Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson says the federal government will not grant an export permit to ship the 30 whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom aquarium.

Thompson says approving the request would mean a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment for the whales.

She says the decision is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, made entertainment shows illegal and forbade breeding.

Twenty whales have died at Marineland since 2019 and the 30 that remain are the last captive whales in Canada.

Marineland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OPEC+ panel stresses need for full compliance with oil output limits,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Alex Lawler

LONDON (Reuters) -An OPEC+ panel stressed the need for achieving full compliance with oil output agreements and extra output cuts that some members are required to make to compensate for earlier exceeding quotas at a meeting on Wednesday, OPEC said in a statement.

The online meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, started at about 1230 GMT.

The JMMC retains the authority to convene additional meetings or request a full meeting of OPEC+ if needed, the statement said. It does not hold decision-making authority over OPEC+ production levels.

Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?,"Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?





Coffee growers are dealing with a lot right now.

Growers face a waning labor force, and the areas where coffee can reliably grow are poised to shrink dramatically. While your morning cup isn't going away anytime soon, it could become more expensive — and could taste different, too.

Ottawa denies Marineland request to export its remaining beluga whales to China,"Ottawa has denied a request from Marineland to send its remaining beluga whales to China.

Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson says the federal government will not grant an export permit to ship the 30 whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom aquarium.

Thompson says approving the request would mean a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment for the whales.

She says the decision is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, made entertainment shows illegal and forbade breeding.

Twenty whales have died at Marineland since 2019 and the 30 that remain are the last captive whales in Canada.

Marineland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Coffee growers are dealing with a lot right now. Most immediately, the Trump administration's tariffs, which threaten their sales, add to the ongoing challenges of pests and diseases for coffee production.

While your morning cup isn't going away anytime soon, it could become more expensive — and could taste different, too. In honor of International Coffee Day on Oct. 1, we're taking stock of the world of coffee and what to expect in the years to come.

Ottawa denies Marineland request to export its remaining beluga whales to China,"Ottawa has denied a request from Marineland to send its remaining beluga whales to China, Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson said Wednesday.

The federal government will not grant an export permit to ship the 30 whales to the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom aquarium, she said.

They are the last captive whales in Canada.

Twenty whales — one killer whale and 19 belugas — have died at the Niagara Falls, Ont., tourist attraction since 2019, according to a database created by The Canadian Press based on internal documents and official statements.

""To approve the request would have meant a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment,"" Thompson said in a statement.

Why Growing Revenue Won't Guarantee A Bigger Exit When Selling,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Growing revenue feels like progress. It's the metric most business owners obsess over, the one that looks great on a chart or in a pitch deck. But here's the catch: business buyers don't reward revenue, they reward business value. The smaller businesses that command the highest price when sold aren't the ones with the biggest revenue. They're the ones built to run without the founder, with systems, contracts, and recurring income that make growth predictable.

OPEC+ panel stresses need for full compliance with oil output limits,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Alex Lawler

LONDON (Reuters) -An OPEC+ panel stressed the need for achieving full compliance with oil output agreements and extra output cuts that some members are required to make to compensate for earlier exceeding quotas at a meeting on Wednesday, OPEC said in a statement.

The online meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes top ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, started at about 1230 GMT.

The JMMC retains the authority to convene additional meetings or request a full meeting of OPEC+ if needed, the statement said. It does not hold decision-making authority over OPEC+ production levels.

Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?,"Change is brewing in the coffee industry. What lies ahead?





Coffee growers are dealing with a lot right now. Most immediately, the Trump administration's tariffs, which threaten their sales, add to the ongoing challenges of pests and diseases for coffee production. In the longer term, experts say the coffee industry can't continue with business as usual. Growers face a waning labor force, and the areas where coffee can reliably grow are poised to shrink dramatically. While your morning cup isn't going away anytime soon, it could become more expensive — and could taste different, too. In honor of International Coffee Day on Oct. 1, we're taking stock of the world of coffee and what to expect in the years to come.

Candles? As Gifts? Groundbreaking. Try This Chic Scent Diffuser Instead.,"Something I unabashedly love about myself is that I am a great gift giver. I’ve given friends unique jewelry pieces that wind up in their daily rotation, surprised my parents with sweet birthday treats that fit within their diet, and once gifted my fiancé’s brother-in-law (a guy I barely knew) with coffee beans so good he still orders them to this day. I guess you could say this talent is just my gift in life.

Candles? As Gifts? Groundbreaking. Try This Chic Scent Diffuser Instead.,"Something I unabashedly love about myself is that I am a great gift giver. I’ve given friends unique jewelry pieces that wind up in their daily rotation, surprised my parents with sweet birthday treats that fit within their diet, and once gifted my fiancé’s brother-in-law (a guy I barely knew) with coffee beans so good he still orders them to this day. I guess you could say this talent is just my gift in life.

If you’re wondering how you, too, can become an expert-level gifter, here’s my secret: always choose the unexpected. The best presents are the ones people might not buy for themselves but end up using every single day. That’s why, this holiday season, I’m skipping the predictable candle aisle and reaching for something more chic, more versatile, and — honestly — more fun: the Air Wi",Bustle,2025-10-01T13:01:43Z,https://www.bustle.com/shopping/candles-as-gifts-groundbreaking-try-this-chic-scent-diffuser-instead,2025-10-01 23:03:35.163518,0.4745098039215687

Florida was a top destination for immigrants who came to the US under Biden,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — After Paola Freites was allowed into the U.S. in 2024, she and her husband settled in Florida, drawn by warm temperatures, a large Latino community and the ease of finding employment and housing.

They were among hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the state in recent years as immigration surged under former President Joe Biden.

No state has been more affected by the increase in immigrants than Florida, according to internal government data obtained by The Associated Press.

Florida was a top destination for immigrants who came to the US under Biden,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — After Paola Freites was allowed into the U.S. in 2024, she and her husband settled in Florida, drawn by warm temperatures, a large Latino community and the ease of finding employment and housing.

They were among hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the state in recent years as immigration surged under former President Joe Biden.

No state has been more affected by the increase in immigrants than Florida, according to internal government data obtained by The Associated Press. Florida had 1,271 migrants who arrived from May 2023 to January 2025 for every 100,000 residents, followed by New York, California, Texas and Illinois.
