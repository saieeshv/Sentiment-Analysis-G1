T,1o7954w,wallstreetbets,AHOY! We set sail on the Digital Ocean - DOCN $20k YOLO,"Ahoy Mateys, Last week I introduced you guys to the [P A T H](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1o18pxg/30k_yolo_on_uipath_the_path_to_generational_wealth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which was up 30% until the Trump Tariff Tape Bomb on Friday. I'm still holding a large January position there (see updates in post). Thesis intact! But now, it be time to set sail on the DIGITAL OCEAN $DOCN as well! I noticed a lot of you discussing “FuNdAmEnTaLs” and “PrIcE tO EaRnInGs RaTiOs.” Maybe some of you need to switch over to r/investing or r/dividends. Since when is this place full of a bunch of value investors? Anyways, here’s an AI play with fundamentals so strong that your mom, dad, grandma and grandpa can buy. Maybe they’ll love you if you can make them some money. I present: DOCN. Below, check out the chart. Notice anything? Almost the exact same set up as P A T H, which took off explosively last week after breaking mult-year accumulation range. Here we have a smaller market cap, and much lower P/E at 31. End of September it JUST completed a Golden Cross. https://preview.redd.it/4spb82g0n9vf1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e8f47a51d85453a5a6da8deed7e2eafc04dd53 Trendline going back to August 2023 indicates a breakout here would be huge, and at a meager market cap of 3.6B, this can easily double from here through the end of the year. Once eyes are on this and it finally gets the attention it deserves, it’s going to absolutely fly in this frothy market that is salivating for any AI play it can sink its teeth into. Now lets look at fUnDamENtalS **What the fuck does DOCN do?** Digital Ocean is a cloud computing company that owns and operates the equipment to run data centers globally. That's right, THEY RUN DATA CENTERS. Oh, just the little old things that are required by **every single AI developer and crypto miner** to do… fucking everything. THINK MARK, THINK. **They’re selling SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH** Now, as if just being a data center isn’t enough to send a stock flying in this market… \**cough cough\**… APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD… \**cough cough*\* DOCN has something that few emerging AI/data/cloud companies bring to the table…**EARNINGS. This company actually makes money. They have a 31 p/e and reported an adjusted EPS of $.92 on September 4, 2025.** **DOCN IS ALSO A DIRECT VENDOR OF AMD CLOUD COMPUTING GPUS.** **The numbers:** Go ahead, take a look. Find me another data/AI company with a $3b market cap boasting numbers like this: https://preview.redd.it/jlywjt63n9vf1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed35a8ce47fd7ee30ddb33f5c79e97f87ed2a45 These guys are printing money for their size. **They BIGLY beat earnings expectations eight times in a row. Last earnings they pumped 30%.** For comparison, APLD has a market cap 3x larger with only \~60m in quarterly revenue. (thats like one third of the quarterly revenue DOCN makes.) Jensen Huangs speech last week emphasized the importance of data centers. And that’s not where the NVDA connection stops… **New Partnerships:** ever heard of NVDA? Ever heard of AMD? Ever heard of openAI? Well… DOCN has deals with **ALL THREE**. The openAI deal is brand new as of October 2025. AS IF this company isn’t a powerhouse on its own… they stand to be a DIRECT BENEFICIARY to the AMD/openAI deal… You know, the one that caused AMD to pump almost 50% last week??? Why? I’ll repeat it again you dense motherfucker. **DOCN IS A DIRECT VENDOR FOR AMD GPUS.** **NAMELY, THE MI300X CHIP.** openAI is driving the implementation of AMD’s chips to supplement the heavy chip demand. As i was preparing this, an additional AMD deal was announced with Oracle for deployment of 50,000 AMD cloud GPUs… data/cloud/ai is the place to be in this market. ***Now of course this is WSB and who cares about fundamentals when the market runs on crushing those “not long” and exploiting gamma ramps, and this is where things start to get really spicy…*** **IV / TA** Let me be clear. This is a 31x p/e company with excellent cash flow. The thesis of this play is NOT a S I play, but a realization of value… That said, bears have painted themselves into a corner. DOCN went public in 2021 and pumped to an ATH of $133 within months… then, stock suffered a large drawdown in the 2021/2022 bear market but stabilized around 30 to 40, where it’s been sideways for three years despite growing their revenue and EPS. Per fintel, the stock has 15.57% S I… That’s not all… check out the insane gamma ramp for the November option expiration. https://preview.redd.it/aa979si9n9vf1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=35413ba0b91d84cc4994fb261e6c85214cef0e75 This can gamma ramp in a hurry with a breakout over $40-45, and IV is still very very low, sitting around 80% across most contracts. And because there’s no weekly options, market makers cannot easily hedge upwards momentum, so there’s absolutely nothing to stand in the way of this gamma ramp a month out if things pick up speed. Monthly options carry much greater gamma risk for market makers. You want in on this before it gets stacked with weeklies! **Analysts upgrades:** turns out, I'm not the only idiot who has found this company… * Canaccord raised their price target from 49 to 55 10/10/2025 * UBS raised price target to 40 from 32 * Market Edge rates it as “Long” (their maximum rating) * LSEG rates this stock as “out-perform” **Position:** Currently holding these calls post dating earnings. 40 x Jan '26 $55c 30x December '25 $55c 55x November $50c https://preview.redd.it/jrbuvp1pc9vf1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41b4bb0a338a482e04bf764f2a5631775eaaad9 https://preview.redd.it/g7fd1kt1d9vf1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a14dbebe04ebc73b0a744f9d317c51bdabd874 TLDR; ***DOCN is*** ***SELLING SHOVELS IN A GOLD RUSH***, they’re a cloud/data center company that makes a lot of fucking money. They have a 30x p/e, a $3.6b market cap, established partnerships with AMD, NVDA, and a brand new October 2025 deal with OPENAI. They also stand to be a direct beneficiary of the AMD/openAI, and AMD/ORCL deal. Other data centers such as APLD, GLXY, CRWV, NBIS, INOD have pumped to the moon, while DOCN has been sleeping despite the fact that it has incredibly strong numbers. The stock is breaking out of a 3 year consolidation. Previous ATH was 133.

AMZN,1okbo7n,wallstreetbets,AMZN's KUIPER is worth $500BN (part of $4T AMZN)..and it's being priced at $0.,"After being mocked and my post on AMZN banned (I swear I don't use AI..) I'm back to provide how I arrive at a $500B valuation for AMZN's Kuiper business. It's Starlink vs. Kuiper, and one of these is being criminally mispriced. # The Starlink Story First, let's give respect where it's due. It's the first mover, the cool kid on the block with \~5,000 satellites in orbit and 2.6 million customers paying for the privilege. They proved this stuff works for real when they kept Ukraine online while the world was throwing money at them. So what's it worth? Somewhere between a new car and a superyacht. Analysts are throwing out numbers from **$10 billion to a whopping $130 billion**. That's a huge range because nobody knows how to value a company that burns cash to build a sci-fi network in the sky. It's a pure-play bet on global internet, and it's a good one. SpaceX builds its own rockets, so they're printing satellites and launching them cheaper than anyone. That's their moat. But Starlink is just an Internet Service Provider. A really, really cool one, but that's it. They sell you access and you pay the bill. # The Kuiper Gambit: Amazon's Checkmate Move Now, let's talk about the real play. Amazon's Project Kuiper. You think Bezos is spending $15 billion extra a quarter just to launch some satellites so you can stream Netflix in the woods? Get real. Kuiper isn't a business; it's a weapon. The strategy is so simple it's genius. Starlink's game plan is: Sell Internet -> Get Money. Kuiper's game plan is: Sell Internet -> Acquire Customer -> Put them in the Amazon Flywheel FOR LIFE. Think about it. Kuiper brings a new customer online in a village in India or on a farm in Nebraska. Where do you think they're going to shop? Amazon. What cloud service will the local businesses there use? AWS. How will they get their stuff? Prime logistics. Kuiper is the ultimate customer acquisition tool, a top-of-funnel marketing machine for a $2 trillion empire. \[Don't take it too literally point is market expansion like Uber and Uber EATS\]. They just inked a deal with JetBlue for free Wi-Fi. That's not a revenue play; that's a proof-of-concept for a B2B blitzkrieg. # So, What's Kuiper Actually Worth? You can't value Kuiper like Starlink. Let's use Starlink's mid-range valuation of **$70 billion** as our starting point for a scaled satellite internet provider. Now, add a massive premium for the Amazon flywheel. The ability to lock customers into the entire Prime/AWS ecosystem is worth more than just subscription fees. That's a **200million subscriber or, $200-$300 billion** advantage, easy. Then, subtract a discount because they're late to the party and don't have their own rockets. They have to beg ULA for launch slots. That's a **-50 billion** haircut. My math puts Kuiper's strategic value at somewhere around **$400 to $600 billion**. And the market is pricing this at **ZERO.** You are literally being given a $500 billion growth engine for free because the clowns on Wall Street are too lazy to read a 10-Q that shows them spending an extra $15 billion a quarter to build it. # -FIN Positions: still at 103 shares https://preview.redd.it/y32a5853dbyf1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac9b79b0083983271966d52ef1563cb00a3efb3 **TLDR: Starlink is a great ISP. Kuiper is a weaponized customer acquisition tool for Amazon. The market is giving away a $500 billion asset for free. Stop playing checkers and start playing 4D chess. Buy AMZN.** Again..I swear it's not AI. If the MODS will unban the AMZN post (again not AI..I just went the extra mile and bulleted it) it'll make a lot of sense for me to add a link here for our all knowing public. edit : I know AMZN is up..we shall see if the numbers stick. https://preview.redd.it/t2ygtj7tcbyf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4088b8650bb5373e975f9de7dfc6f271062f6b4 not AI proof: https://preview.redd.it/pffmr34v6jyf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d903fcc54475f975ef95da25ef568fcbaf222630",114,142,2025-10-30 21:04:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1okbo7n/amzns_kuiper_is_worth_500bn_part_of_4t_amznand/,2025-11-07 16:40:22.595215,1.0,$AMZN,1.0,[],"['bull', 'puts', 'rocket', 'rally', 'revenue', 'acquisition']",0.9342857142857142,Consumer Cyclical
T,1oji9tp,wallstreetbets,Elon's $1T Compensation Package: The Perfect Distraction From TSLA Fundamentals,"**Elon's $1T Compensation Package: The Perfect Distraction From TSLA Fundamentals** Here’s how I plan to trade Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for November 6: * The board and Elon Musk himself are warning (almost to the point of blackmailing) shareholders that if the $1T compensation package doesn't go through, Elon will leave the company. * Several proxy advisor firms and other institutions have advocated against approving this package. This creates a massive overhang on the stock. Why? * Well, if Elon leaves, Tesla is cooked. The stock is trading at 360x P/E, with EPS projected to decline by over 30% yoy in FY 2025. It doesn't take two brain cells to click that Tesla stock is basically Elon's promises. Without him, Tesla would be a boomer automobile maker, trading at boomer P/E multiples (10x lower than today's) * I believe the $1T plan will go through, even though shareholders remain skeptical of the terms, the dilution it could bring, and the moonshot milestones required to hit the 1% stock unlock thresholds. As the overhang (Elon leaving Tesla) dissipates, the stock could rip. I own $460, Nov. 7 call options to ride the wave. *(Note: watch me in the porn loss section next week)* **The $1T Compensation Plan Is THE Perfect Distraction From Fundamentals** The noise around the 2025 shareholder meeting, where a decision on Elon's $1T compensation package will be made, is pretty much why the stock is still staying afloat after releasing terrible Q3 earnings results (despite the tailwind related to the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit in September). To understand what I mean by terrible, take a look at the revenue growth below (quarterly data): [Fiscal AI | Quarterly Revenue Growth \(yoy change\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek4lz67sj4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec911d70f430773c3a8c9fece6601f2a93ba5ec) The one-time bump in Q3 is laughable to say the least. Speaking of laughable things, just take a look at all the promises that management (mainly Elon) failed to deliver this year: [GuidanceTerminal.com | Missed promises from Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/t5wdyhqtj4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea16ae2b557d5d263a690805a9c0dfd5151d57e4) And that's just the tip of the iceberg. How about the future ventures? Let's start with robotaxis first. In Q2, Elon stated: And I think we'll probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. In Q3, this is what he said: And then we do expect to be operating Robotaxi in, I think, about 8 to 10 metro areas by the end of the year. This is the classical mañana, mañana, mañana. He promised autonomous ride-hailing to 50% of the US population and now only to 8-10 metro areas. Today, there are only 2 areas under operation, with a safety driver (chaffeur) on board! Let that sink in: 2 areas since June. And Elon is saying 8-10 before year-end. Moving on to the automotive segment, I was let down by Elon's promise of an affordable model <$30k in H1 2025. [GuidanceTerminal.com | Elon's Goal Evolution Status](https://preview.redd.it/gocvcnqvj4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c58d8e9a28a24d1edf7952e086a5700db74c88b) I mean, it's baffling how management said this in Q3 last year: But now it'll cost on the order of cost roughly $25,000. So it is a $25,000 car. (Elon Musk) Sure. I mean, as Elon and Vaibhav both said, you are in plan, to meet that in the first half of next year. (Lars Moravy) Well, the May 7, 2025 introduction was a Model Y Long Range RWD at $44,990 MSRP (about $37,490 after the $7,500 federal credit). The Model Y Standard is $39,990, and even the recently announced Model 3 Standard is $36,990. Laughable to see how management fails to deliver. Speaking of laughable things: Optimus. Back in Q2, no other than the main man, Elon, said: So there will probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 end of this year and then scale production next year. In Q3, the mañana, mañana pattern emerged again: we look forward to unveiling Optimus V3 probably in Q1. I think it will be ready for -- to show off. I could go on and on, and the list of failed and downgraded promises just keeps on forever. Moving on to the Street's expectations, the top-line (revenue) looks awful this year. Next year, it seems that it could go up by 15%, but that’s only because of an easy comparison (2025 was a slow year, so beating that is not a major feat). [Seeking Alpha | Revenue Expectations](https://preview.redd.it/387nhh0yj4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=dba83aa44460ff555c85921107f7969f58db47b1) On the bottom line, things are raw, with a 31% yoy decline projected this year. [Seeking Alpha | EPS estimates](https://preview.redd.it/783g9dvzj4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc73c80a7d104f284e2a3931a0f22eeb8735fa4d) That 36% improvement that you see next year is, again, due to easy comparables. Take into account that if EPS drops 30% in one year, and increases 30% the next year, you haven't fully recovered the 30% drop. Basic math, boy. So, overall, the picture look raw in the near to mid term for Tesler, regardless of whether Elon is around or not. In any normal scenario, I wouldn't touch this stock (let alone options) with a 10ft pole. So, why do I own ATM call options expiring on November 7? The answer is asymmetric upside. **Tesler Stock Has A Massive Overhang About To Be Removed** For the degens reading this that don't know what overhang means in financial jargon, it refers to a major risk or uncertainty that weighs on a company's stock until it's resolved. Take the example of Alphabet (Google) on September 3: * Shareholders had a carrot up their ass for 5 years as Google was fighting in an antitrust case vs the FTC for its Chrome browser, the Android OS, and the ability to pay Apple (under-the-table style) amounts closer to $20B a year to be the default browser in Safari. * As soon as U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled on September 3 in favor of Google, the stock ripped as the company can keep doing the same shenanigans with Apple. Since then, the stock has been up 30%. Why? **Because a major overhang (i.e., carrot in shareholders' ass) was removed.** How is this related to Tesla? Here is where things get interesting. This Monday, no other than Tesla's Chair, Robyn Denholm, went live on CNBC on a pressure campaign (almost blackmailing in street terms), warning shareholders that if the $1T compensation plan doesn't get through, the company would lose its CEO. She said: Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become In plain English: Tesla is trading at a 1-year forward P/E multiple of 358x. Clarifying for the degens, that means you're paying 358 times for next year's earnings (i.e., the midpoint of Wall Street's expectations). In comparison, boomers are paying 8x for GM's next year's earnings, and tech bros are paying 45x for NVIDIA's next year's earnings. Essentially, she is hinting at three things: 1. Tesler is a meme stock that is trading at a sky-high premium. 2. That premium could rerate and revert back to the median if Elon leaves the company. 3. If you don't vote ""Yes"" to the $1T plan, he leaves and the stock rerates at ""GM-levels"" Now, give me in the comments section one chair of a publicly traded company in the US that went live on TV to recommend shareholders voting for a specific clause within a proxy statement (for the degens that don't know what a proxy is, this is a DEF14A filing that contains the details of Elon's compensation plan). For context, she went live on CNBC due to the pushback from boomer proxy advisor firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who publicly recommended voting ""No"" for Elon's compensation plan. By the way, those two are just the tip of the iceberg. There are many others pushing shareholders to vote ""No"", including the SOC Investment Group, several state treasurers (including Nevada, New Mexico, and Connecticut), Americans for Financial Reform, AFT, CWA, or Public Citizen. In fact, Elon himself called[ ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/24/elon-musk-corporate-terrorists-iss-glass-lewis-proxy-advisors-pay.html)these players the T word in the last earnings call. **So, what?** Believe it or not, Tesla is mostly owned by institutional investors and not retail degenerates. [Fiscal AI | Tesla Stock Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/k6ae37c2k4yf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8df7eef08220e33cd4b9f911e36a2cc2e97d446) These heads of these funds are mostly boomers (on substances) who tend to hire firms to advise them on what to do. Those firms are right now recommending against the $1T compensation plan. Therefore, shareholders have a carrot up their ass, similar to Alphabet shareholders in the 5-year antitrust case, but the resolution date is just a week from now (November 6). I have a high conviction that there is an overhang on Tesla right now. I argue that if the overhang dissipates, shares could rip (similar to Alphabet, or any public US equity on April 9, when the market realized Trump was bluffing with the tariffs on his April 2 spreadsheet). **The Trading Opportunity** I'm betting with my call options ($460 strike, Nov. 7 expiration) that the $1T plan will get approved, and Elon will remain in the company, pumping the stock in his style. Why am I so convinced? Simple. It doesn’t take two brain cells to see this fact: If Elon is not around, Tesla will tank. As a shareholder, that's the last thing you want, regardless whether you like the $1T plan or not. Therefore, I believe the boomers who own most of Tesla (I’m talking about >1% holders, not “Eric the degen” who can barely afford 10 shares) will still vote yes while gritting their teeth. Once the $1T compensation plan gets approved, bulls will likely pump the stock as the overhang disappears. **If you think this is a sell on the news, think twice.** A sell on the news is a sell on an anticipated event where you know something is about to be announced with certainty (i.e., the new iPhone 17, the Model 3 Standard, Nvidia's GTC events, etc). However, even though I am convinced that the $1T package will go through, **there is no guarantee it will**. This adds uncertainty, which is not welcomed by the market (therefore, the overhang). In other words, I don't think there will be a sell on the news. That said, if the package doesn't go through, you will see me in the porn loss section.

CMG just reported terrible traffic trends, particularly among 25-35 year olds (Uber's core demographic). 1. **Expectations are high**: Consensus expects $0.67 EPS with ""high teens"" gross bookings growth. That's ambitious when restaurant stocks are showing consumer pullback. 2. **Limited upside, meaningful downside**: Stock would need to beat significantly just to make new highs. But any miss or cautious guidance could trigger 10-15% correction to align with peer group weakness. 3. **Recent volume divergence**: Rising prices on declining volume is a bearish divergence - similar pattern preceded CMG's collapse. 4. **Macro headwinds**: If Gen Z/millennials are cutting dining out (per Chipotle's CEO), they're probably also reducing Uber rides and food delivery frequency. By Revenue: * **Delivery (Eats): 32%** ($4.1B) Nearly a third of Uber's revenue comes from food delivery. If Chipotle's 25-35 year olds are cutting back on dining out, they're probably also cutting Uber Eats orders. The fact that Uber is still near all-time highs while restaurant stocks (their customer pipeline) have cratered is a massive red flag. Uber Eats is essentially a leveraged bet on restaurant traffic - and that traffic is collapsing according to CMG's latest report. This makes Monday's earnings even riskier.

T,1on5kky,ValueInvesting,A quick and dirty valuation of Reddit stock.,"The Emphasis is on quick and dirty. The methodology is quite simple. We calculate the implied share price at the end of 2029. We then compare this with the last closed price and see if it meets our investment criteria. I will go through it step by step so that you can DIY. - **Start by estimating the revenue at the end of 2029.** I took the lazy route by checking what analyst are predicting by the sales nos for Reddit for the next few years out: Morningstar PDF from my broker: 2024 -> 1,300,205a 2,139,845e. 2,993,706e. 3,813,981e. 4,782,732e. 5,901,892e <- 2029 Discountingcashflows dot com 2024 -> 1,280a. 2,128e. 2,927e. 3,760e. 4,535e. 5,751e. <- 2029. I just averaged it to (5751+5902)/2 =5,826.5 - **we then calculate the revenue per share taking into consideration the roughly 8% dilution a year.** In the most recently past quarter, Reddit alluded that the SBC was 16% of sales, so the TTM SBC = 305m. So with a market cap of 38.5bn, this amounted to about 8%. Now, a big assumption is, IF we assume the same dilution for the next four years, the same share count by the end of 2029 would have increased to 267m shares. The revenue per share in end 2029 = 5826.5 / 267 =$21.8 - **Next we try and figure out a range of P/S ratio that is appropriate. We then apply these ratios on the revenue per share:** Currently the P/S is a nosebleed 20 times of revenue. Is this reasonable given that the peer group (META and GOOGL) has a P/S of around 9? Maybe. It could be argued that Meta and Google are now mature whereas RDDT just IPO last year and is in a growth phase. Or perhaps it might be more reasonable to see what were the P/S during the first 5-6 years of META or GOOGL when they IPO’ed ? For Meta the average 5 year p/s since ipo is 15, and for Google it is 12. So we have the following ranges for P/S: Optimistic scenario based on present P/S: 20 Scenario based on Meta’s first five year average P/S: 15 Scenario of mature peer average: 9 The implied future share price are: Scenario 1: 20*21.8=436 ( nosebleed levels) Scenario 2:15*21.8=327 (compare meta’s first 5 years since ipo) Scenario 3:9*21.8=196.2 (compare with mature peers) - **Since the implied price is in the future, we should compare this implied price with the last closed price and see if it meets your investing criteria.** The SP returns to get to the implied returns are as follows, given RDDT’s last price is almost 209: Scenario 1, (436/209)^(1/4) -1 =0.202 or 20.2% a year for next 4 year to Dec 2029 Scenario 2, (327 /209)^(1/4) -1=0.118 or 11.8% a year For Scenario 3, the future price is lower than present price. Is a p/s of 9 low for RDDT ? Goggle and META are at the forefront of AI and they have “only” a p/s of 9. Flipping the narrative around, Does it mean that investors today are too optimistic of RDDT with a P/S of 20? **Conclusion:** How confident are we that RDDT’s present P/S will still be the same 20x sales at the end of 2029? Or in the case of scenario 2, is a share price return of 11.2% a year adequate enough? My expectation for a boring investing is 2x5y, or 15% a year. I would certainly expect a higher return for an additional investment in RDDT. And probably ask for a deeper discount in case my assumptions are wrong. I would consider adding more to my existing investment at $150, unless RDDT can grow faster than the revenue numbers estimated by analysts (above). ——— Fin ———- **some additional comments** RDDT is on a land grab for expansion and DAU, and it has not reported a full year of GAAP positive earnings yet. I decided to use Sales instead of earnings as sales is more stable and is more appropriate for companies which isn’t profitable or lack a history of positive earnings. Case in point, the profit estimates range from 20%, 30% to 42%. Wall Street analysts are also guessing. Why ? **Because the company is giving revenue guidance but doesn’t want to provide earning guidance, just some hints on EBITDA** *""In the fourth quarter 2025, we estimate revenue in the range of $655 million to $665 million, representing 53% to 55% year-over-year revenue growth with a midpoint of about 54%. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $275 million to $285 million, representing approximately 78% to 85% year-over-year growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42% at the midpoint.""* said the CFO At some point in the future, once their earnings are stabilised, I will switched to earnings. But for now I will use p/s as it is more stable.",39,14,2025-11-03 07:31:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1on5kky/a_quick_and_dirty_valuation_of_reddit_stock/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.859520,1.0,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'ipo']",0.9285714285714285,Communication Services
T,1o6qrdt,ValueInvesting,Why The AI Bubble May Not Pop Anytime Soon,"Let's first set aside the fact that every valuation metric is nearing their most historically elevated levels. Valuation isn't a timing mechanism, and while it's a good metric for judging forward returns, PE ratios don't exist in a vacuum. But even with valuations at elevated levels, it takes much more for a pure washout. In 2008, it was leverage...which was prevalent throughout the entire system (from banks to investors to consumers). In 2000, it was an entire sector that was created overnight that had no prospect of earnings. Valuations are a decent predictor for long-term forward returns, but that's about as far as it goes. There's no indication that a 40x CAPE means that the market ""has"" to crash. As far as I can tell, there's no relationship between PE ratio and drawdown magnitude. So while I think it's a decent bet to predict that stocks will outperform bonds by only a few basis points over the next decade, I don't think we can predict what that path looks like. Here's why I don't expect a crash. >***It's very difficult to go bankrupt without any debt.*** >\~ Peter Lynch I think in order to see a true washout, we need to see large companies disappear basically overnight. In 2008, that was driven by immense leverage that infected the entire financial system from banks to investors to consumers. In 2000, the Nasdaq was filled with companies that were priced off of impossible future earnings. Today, just look at the market. Look at the S&P 500 constituents. Aside from the top 10, it's filled with real companies with real earnings. And corporate leverage is very low. Interest coverage ratios are well within historical bounds ([Goldman Sachs: Exhibit 11](https://www.goldmansachs.com/ayco/materials/isg-content/ISG-impact-of-rising-rates-on-corporate-debt-us-equities.pdf) & [JPM: Page 13](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf)). And these should only improve as rates come down. And yes, the Mag 7 make up 30% of the index. But even if the market grew a conscience tomorrow and re-rated the Mag 7 down by 40%, that only represents a 12% decline in the market. ***The system isn't static.*** >I owned META in 2022 when it was trading at single digit PE levels. I sold it on the basis that the metaverse was a business endeavor that was a destruction in value. They were burning so much cash on it. >Later that year, Zuck announced that they were scaling back investment on that project, and the rest was history. I never bought back in. >This is an important lesson when looking at the current state of fiscal policy. We shouldn’t anchor to the 30% global tariffs and 130% tariffs on iPhones. As policy changes, we should update our valuation assumptions with it. I do think we should be cognizant of how unhinged and random the administration is with trade policy, and perhaps ‘some’ extra risk premium should be applied to the market to account for it, but we probably shouldn’t expect some massive repricing event right now. >Yes, tariffs are still on, but the 10% range is something that is much more palatable for US businesses and consumers. >Also, the walk-back in policy this past week does signal that the POTUS put is in play. Donald does care what markets are doing. >\~ [Me, April 12th, 2025](https://substack.com/@riskpremium/note/c-108294047?r=1r289e&utm_source=notes-share-action&utm_medium=web) This lesson extends to AI capex as well. There's nothing that says that if AI isn't working out that all these companies have to stick with those projects. And the outcome is net zero. Whatever cash comes off of Nvidia's CF statement only lifts the bottom line for the other constituents. So sure, Nvidia probably gets hammered. But it only helps the other companies' bottom lines. That's not to say Microsoft and Google, et. al won't get hurt. There's a lot of potential energy stored in these AI projects. But if the market deems AI as a money-loser, I can only imagine the market will cheer if they pare back on AI projects. ***There still is some bubble behavior.*** With all that being said, there are some pockets of the market that do worry me. Companies like Oklo, Quantumscape, Joby are all pricing in the prospects of a very different future. And that's usually a bad bet. I'm also seeing companies like Solid Power being resurrected from the dead despite having no product, no potential of a product, and on no news. That stock is up almost 7-fold off the lows. These are just a few of the stocks that I follow; you probably personally see it in your own areas of interest. But we're still no where near the levels of euphoria that we saw in late 2020 / early 2021 where ARK funds were a ""sure thing"" and NFTs were auctioning for millions. That's the level of behavior that I think I want to see before I got worried about euphoria. And yes, tariffs worry me, and the prospect of a trade war worries me. But again, the system is dynamic. There's really nothing that says tariffs = recession in the same way that Covid didn't equal a global financial meltdown. ***Summary*** I don't think I see a path to a stock market washout, just yet. 2021 & 2000 are the models for euphoria. 2008 is the model for financial irresponsibility. We currently have neither. AI probably is a bubble, but I also don't think we're pricing in some manic level of optimism there either. Maybe if we get to a point where AI tokens become a line item on balance sheets, then I'll start to worry. We're not there yet. That's not to say there isn't excess we could work off, though. And if you're scared of a 20% - 30% correction, that's perfectly okay. It's probably just a sign that you're not positioned correctly for your risk tolerance. I'm not full equities, and I'm certainly no where near 100% US stocks. ***In a world where investors are going increasingly risk-on, it makes sense to take your foot off the pedal.*** But we also shouldn't let the prospect of a 25% correction shake us out of the markets completely. To end with another Peter Lynch quote: >***Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.*** >\~ Peter Lynch",141,110,2025-10-14 20:27:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6qrdt/why_the_ai_bubble_may_not_pop_anytime_soon/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.884555,1.0,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'pe ratio']",0.9114285714285714,Communication Services
AMZN,1onek60,stocks,NVDA and AMZN are in the spotlight again. Trump’s new AI chip stance might explain why,"$NVDA and $AMZN have been dominating the headlines this week, and it’s not hard to see why. Trump just said that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will be reserved exclusively for U.S. companies, keeping them out of China and potentially other countries. The move could reshape how AI infrastructure develops globally, and investors seem to be pricing in the implications fast. It’s a huge statement not just for Nvidia but for any tech firm tied to cloud, AI, or chip supply chains. $AMZN, being heavily invested in AI infrastructure through AWS, could indirectly benefit from this tighter export control since U.S. cloud providers might now have a competitive edge in accessing top-tier Nvidia hardware. As expected, NVDA’s intraday swings have been intense. While tracking its movements, I’ve also been through Bitget’s “Stock Futures Rush” event. They’re currently running a $250,000 pool in tokenized $TSLA shares for active stock futures traders. I’ve been testing out pairs like NVDAUSDT and TSLAUSDT there.. mostly to see how tokenized stock futures behave around news-driven volatility like this. Liquidity and execution have been smoother than I expected, especially considering how new this market still is. I’m still on the fence about how far tokenized equities will go, but it’s been interesting to see crypto-native platforms trying to mirror real equity sentiment in real time. The overlap between traditional stock news (like Trump’s AI policy) and tokenized market reactions is becoming more noticeable. Anyone else here has tried trading tokenized stock futures or sees potential in these crossover markets. Do you think restrictions like this could actually strengthen U.S.-based AI firms long-term, or will they just push China to double down on domestic chip development?",45,9,2025-11-03 15:21:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1onek60/nvda_and_amzn_are_in_the_spotlight_again_trumps/,2025-11-07 16:40:48.546527,1.0,$AMZN,0.9,"['TSLA', 'AMZN', 'NVDA']",[],0.8999999999999999,Consumer Cyclical

AMZN,1obqpxr,ValueInvesting,Value Trap - AMZN,"I have seen a few comments today about AMZN being a value trap, and they are mentioning because of the increasing competition. I see the massive and relentless reinvestments that Amazon makes, and they usually oay off. Competition: I do see walmart online as the main competition to Amazon (not Temu or otherwise). With Walmart having such a big physical imprint, their online presence is still way behind, in fact most of us don’t even consider it very often. I believe this is slowly going to change over the next 5-10 years. Walmart is roughly 6% of the online Ecommerce space and Amazon is 6x that, at roughly 35%. I believe the best way to Amazon to continue to compete against Walmart is to keep growing their physical footprint with Whole Food Market and Amazon Fresh. I believe Amazon will integrate their online platform with the physical a lot better than Walmart, which will lead to further growth. Amazon is utilizing technology that makes shopping easier, like the walk-in, walk-out approach, no register needed. We all know how they’re ranking in video streaming, cloud computing, and digital advertising (in the top 3 for all of those) and we know that the competition is fierce. I feel confident in Amazon’s moves. They’re going to be covering every corner of the US market online, and physical.

T,1ojdtli,wallstreetbets,"Lumentum $LITEs it up: 200G Lasers, Key Supplier of NVIDIA Optics, and the Exploding Demand for Optical Networking","Lasers. Pew pew! 1. Introduction 2. The Company 3. Giga-Chads and Giga-Watts 4. Co-Packaged Optics 5. Optical Circuit Switching 6. Taking Share from Competitor 7. Industry Consolidation 8. Tariffs 9. Short Interest 10. Catalysts 11. Positions or Ban **1. Introduction : The Exploding Demand for Optical Bandwidth** As AI clusters and cloud infrastructure demand more and more networking bandwidth, electronic links in the datacenter are being confined to shorter and shorter distances. Yet as these datacenters promise to consume exponentially more power to satisfy this massive bandwidth, operators are disaggregating them into disparate physical sites up to hundreds of miles apart in order to reliably deliver them the giga-Watts of power they require and adequately cool them. Networking infrastructure both within and between datacenters is being increasingly built with photonic links. For the same reasons -- power, latency and reliability being paramount -- operators are giving renewed attention to optics for datacenter switching in a slow but growing move away from traditional electrical packet switching. I believe Lumentum ($LITE) is the optical product maker best-positioned to capitalize on these near- and far-term transformations. **2. The Company : Cloud Revenue Inflecting Upward, Massive Purchase from NVIDIA** Lumentum earns roughly 90% of its \~$500MM quarterly revenue from its optical transceivers and lasers chips for cloud and networking applications. It earns the remaining 10% from industrial and consumer segments, neither of which are covered here. Its primary moneymakers are transceivers capable of up to 800G transmission and lasers capable of up to 200G modulation. Its EM Lasers are used as the light source for optical datacenter interconnect (DCI) and its narrow linewidth lasers light up 400ZR and 800ZR coherent optical links capable of 100km transmission. Operators like Meta, Microsoft, and AWS are deploying these 400ZR, 800ZR and eventually 1600ZR coherent links in massive quantities to connect up their datacenters and AI factories. These fiber links are lit by narrow-linewidth lasers, of which Lumentum's are considered best-in-class due to the higher yields on them they realize compared to competitors' lasers, per management commentary. This capability gives the company favorable ""pricing latitude"" and ""price levers"" per the CEO that, per the CFO, would provide further upside to the company's already-improving margins. Lumentum's experience in developing high-power lasers for subsea fiber links gave them the foundation for development of the ultra-high-power lasers that NVIDIA has turned to for its 200G photonic-enabled switches with co-packaged optics (CPO). This commitment from NVIDIA, announced last quarter, is Lumentum's largest-ever purchase order. This arrangement is just in its early innings. Lumentum's cloud-facing revenue is inflecting upward and drove Q42025 revenue above even the company's revised guidance. Cloud revenue grew 16% QoQ and 67% YoY. Management cites ""exceptional"" demand from hyperscalers for both their transceiver modules and laser components. Their modules revenue grew 50% QoQ, and management expects their components business to have a breakout year in 2026. The company has expanded its US manufacturing capacity in order to produce more of its components State-side and meet the heavy demand for its products. **3. Giga-Chads and Giga-Watts : Distributed AI Factories and ""Scale-Across"" Infrastructure** That giga-chad Mark Zuckerberg is building giga-Watt datacenters. NVIDIA is building networking switches with integrated photonics that connect ""AI Factories"" to millions of GPUs across physical sites. Microsoft is spending $80bn on its regional Azure datacenters. The massive energy consumption of these networked elements necessitates that they be disaggregated into multiple physical sites, all of which are linked by high-speed optics. NVIDIA terms this the ""scale-across"" network, expanding on their ""scale-up"" and scale-out"" capabilities. These \~100km links are built today with 400ZR/ZR+ coherent optical technology, which is ramping 30% YoY, while the industry is rapidly transitioning to 800ZR/ZR+ with 1600ZR/ZR+ on the horizon. Coherent optics require the high-power narrow-linewidth lasers that Lumentum specializes in: coherent module and DSP makers like Cisco, Ciena and Marvel are shipping as many of these as they can build. Lumentum signaled strong demand for these lasers in its 3Q24 report. Lumentum's 100G and 200G EM Lasers are also in high demand. Providers are turning to 100G and increasingly 200G optics to satisfy the demands of their AI workloads in scale-out networks. Lumentum's 200G EM Lasers are on allocation and allow the company to take price as mentioned above. **4. Co-Packaged Optics : Key Ecosystem Partner in NVIDIA's ""Scale-Out"" Networks** Electrical interconnects within the datacenter are also being migrated to optical technologies. Co-packaged optics (CPO) are the long-term answer to meeting AI networks' requirements for low latency, low power, high reliability and high faceplate density. Major switch makers like Broadcom, NVIDIA and Cisco are integrating optics right next to the switch silicon to simplify the connection to the optical fiber and eliminate the cost and power of the DSP that the switch otherwise has to connect to in a traditional external pluggable optical module. NVIDIA demonstrated that their switches with CPO photonics engines consume 67% less power than their pluggable switches. CPO will eventually cannibalize the intra-DC pluggable module business. CPO requires high-power lasers to light up the link's optical fiber. Last quarter, Lumentum reported their largest-ever PO, for their high-power lasers for a 200G CPO application. This is almost certainly for NVIDIA's CPO photonic switches. Lumentum appears for now to be the only vendor approved by them for these lasers: ""We believe we have a good competitive moat that will keep us in that position (of being sole-sourced)"". I expect to hear of follow-on orders for CPO lasers in Lumentum's upcoming quarterly call: The company expects a ""significant revenue ramp in CPO by the second half of calendar 2026."" Lumentum manufactures these lasers in a US fab, exempting them from any tariffs on this revenue, while also expanding capacity. So, they are the vendor with the largest capacity to produce these lasers, of which theirs are the industry's best-performing, while being the sole supplier approved for NVIDIA's CPO switches. A knock on CPO has been the perception of its inferior reliability compared to traditional pluggable modules. Meta dispelled this at the ECOC conference last month, stating, ""While CPO’s value in substantially reducing power over traditional re-timed transceivers has been well established, the integrated nature of CPO and its impact to the reliability, availability, and serviceability at scale has been elusive... Within this initial time period spanning over 15 million device hours, we have observed zero unserviceable failures as well as a 5x improvement in link reliability compared to traditional pluggable optical modules... As we continue to explore innovative solutions offering reliable and power-efficient optical connectivity for the AI networks, these CPO reliability results reinforce its viability to address the future optical I/O challenges of data center network infrastructure."" CPO has been a technology long on the horizon of the optical networking industry, but its widespread adoption is imminent. **5. Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) : An New and Expanding Market** In the face of ballooning power DC and AI factory power consumption, hyperscalers and DC operators are showing renewed and increasing interest in OCS as an alternative, if not replacement, to electrical packet switching. OCS is not new, having had its moment in the sun in 1990s and early 2000s. Google was perhaps the first major DC operator to deploy it at scale in recent years, finding that it improved power by 40%, cost by 30% and uptime by 50x. OCS is particularly suited to AI applications because of its low latency and high reliability. Last quarter, Lumentum reported the shipment of OCS evaluation units and more recently has announced additional OCS products, likely in response to customer interest. They have two hyperscalers signed onto their OCS platform with a third committed for 2026. Management said last quarter that OCS will bring ""very, very significant revenue in Q1, Q2 and then certainly in the back half of calendar 2026."" So that's a second significant 2H2026 revenue inflection. OCS is now a $100MM+ revenue source for the company with margins ""significantly"" above the corporate average and a time frame to significant revenue that is becoming ""sharply clear that it's sooner rather than later."" **6. Taking Share from Competitor** Coherent ($COHR) is Lumentum's primary US-based competitor vying to supply the networking industry with optical components (lasers, OCS, transceivers). We noted that Lumentum is sharply growing its cloud and datacom business. This appears to be coming at Coherent's expense, because even in this era of massive spending on network infrastructure and heavy demand for optical gear, they issued weaker-than-expected guidance last quarter. Their datacenter revenue growth continues to slow, to 24% from the prior quarters' 39%, 46% and 58%. Investors punished them severely for this miss, sending the stock down 20%. Lumentum appears to be taking share: their datacom growth stands at 44% while Coherent's is only 4%. Lumentum as noted is presently the only laser vendor approved by NVIDIA for its CPO switches, while Coherent made no mention of any new POs or wins in the CPO space. Lumentum has the incumbent advantage here. And in OCS, management states that they have been able ""to capture volume opportunities earlier than competitors."" **7. Industry Consolidation : Component Makers Get Snapped Up** The recent history of the optical networking industry shows numerous acquisitions. Barriers to entry have grown as bandwidths increase, dimensions shrink and semiconductor mask costs reach into the tens of millions. Smaller firms that develop key enabling technologies or components have been the ones to be snapped up. Lumentum CEO Michael Hurlston has been through to this. He led Finisar when it was acquired by II-VI (now Coherent) in 2018. On the flip side of the ledger, Lumentum acquired Neophotonics in 2021 to capture its expertise in building the narrow-linewidth lasers that have become a lynchpin of the coherent optics segment. For motivations similar to those expressed in the quotes below, I believe Lumentum is on the short list of photonics suppliers that a larger system integrator, module maker or certain GPU networking giant would seek to acquire. NVIDIA in particular could acquire Lumentum to secure its supply of lasers for its CPO switches, while also bringing in-house the engineering expertise needed to incorporate optical switching into its back-end AI network installations. Small OCS matrices like the 64x64 product Lumentum just announced would be well-suited to this application. This of course is more speculative than my arguments of where Lumentum's near-term business is headed. Nonetheless it's a feasible outcome for the company and one I want exposure to. * Nokia acquires Infinera for $2.3B, Feb. 2025: ""This transaction will significantly improve our scale and profitability in optical networks, and allows us to speed up the pace of innovation to meet the requirements of the AI era."" * II-VI acquires Coherent for $6.6B, July 2022: ""Coherent is an innovator with a rich portfolio of some of the most advanced technologies in the world, which have been transformative in a broad range of markets."" * Lumentum acquires Neophotonics for $900M, Nov. 2021: ""With NeoPhotonics, we're making another important investment in better serving our customers and expanding our photonics capabilities at a time when photonics are at the forefront of favorable long-term market trends."" * Marvel acquires Inphi for $10B, Apr. 2021: ""Inphi’s technologies are at the heart of cloud data center networks and they continue to extend their leadership with innovative new products, including 400G data center interconnect optical modules, which leverage their unique silicon photonics and DSP technologies."" * Cisco acquires Acacia for $4.5B, July 2019: ""With the explosion of bandwidth in the multi-cloud era, optical interconnect technologies are becoming increasingly strategic. The acquisition of Acacia will allow us to build on the strength of our switching, routing and optical networking portfolio to address our customers' most demanding requirements."" * Cisco acquires Luxtera for $660M, Feb. 2019: ""Coupled with our silicon and optics innovation, Luxtera will allow our customers to build the biggest, fastest and most efficient networks in the world."" * II-VI acquires Finisar for $3.2B, Nov. 2018: ""Today our company is taking a giant leap forward in our scale to serve a significantly increasing addressable market."" **8. Tariffs : Not a Threat** Tariffs have not materially affected Lumentum's financial performance and management has stated that they do not anticipate them to. But with our mercurial president at the helm, the risk that tariffs will be levied on optics is ever-present. **9. Short Interest : 15% SI, 5-Day D T C and 120% Institutional Ownership** While lower than the crazy 100%+ SI values we've aped on here, I consider 15% SI to be substantial, especially for a company in as strong of a position as Lumentum's. The stock has risen 200% over the past six months, during which time SI has hovered between 15% and 18%, implying they're in a neutral-to-losing position. The stock is on at least one broker's hard-to-borrow list. Its 4.7-day D T C and 120% institutional ownership imply a tight float. If Lumentum publishes a strong earning report on Nov. 4 as I expect they will, one could envision a rush to close these short positions. I have a hard time seeing the bear case here. **10. Catalysts** As mentioned, Lumentum reports 2026Q1 results Nov. 4 after market close. I expect a solid earnings beat and positive guidance around additional CPO-related orders, 200G EM L laser volumes and favorable pricing, and inflecting OCS revenue. Hearing of continuing high infrastructure CapEx from Meta, Microsoft and Amazon when they each report this week should also be viewed as beneficial to the stock. A rush to cover short positions in response to a beat would provide further upward momentum. **11. Positions** I own 2100 shares, worth $440k at today's $191 share price. I opened Nov. 7 230C for leverage to Lumentum's earnings release, and Nov. 21 250C for leverage to NVIDIA's (Nov. 19). I may also buy calls with a further expiration to remain exposed to the longer-term industry migrations detailed here. https://preview.redd.it/6ztf5n3dp3yf1.png?width=2115&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb1f9b523abac3572e3b27df6d4304e5d402db05 https://preview.redd.it/uzoo1modp3yf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ae21e5142142843a8c65083e1feccc29836d3ec **TLDR:** Lasers.

T,1ochvdl,wallstreetbets,Meta – DD From a Senior Finance Manager,"My favorite earnings play this quarter is one of the bigger companies, Meta (Q3 earnings 10/29/25 after market closes). I strongly believe Meta will beat earnings this upcoming quarter due to the following: 1. EPS Historical trends – Meta has **beat** the last 8 earnings cycles. From a management perspective, compensation is almost always tied to beating earnings and it’s up to senior management to push back on sand bagged forecasts. When a company beats earnings for 8 cycles in a row, it’s likely upper management are not pushing back too hard on goal setting forecasts, which makes it more likely that they will also beat earnings this cycle. https://preview.redd.it/4carlwaqthwf1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=610b5c9521adcf4c8d4f8734a61d90336b26023e 2. CapEx Spend – **Meta is planning on increasing capex spend from $39.2b in 2024 to $66b+ in 2025 to targeting $100b in 2026**. In the first half of 2025 alone, capex spend was already $30.7b, largely around investment in AI infrastructure. From a Corporate Finance perspective, there are usually capex reviews on a monthly-quarterly basis. By October 2025, I’d expect the 2026 plan to be completed and possibly the plan up to 2030 to be completed. Capex approval is usually closely related to future revenue. If the team is projecting that revenue will be flat, capex will usually also need to be flat. Given that there is an approval for significant increase in capex spend, revenue projections should be out the roof. Whether or not actual revenue comes in at those projections will be next years problem as the stock bump will come in when they announce the upward revised rev projections. 3. AI Industry Bullish – In the past year, the AI industry has been extremely bullish. Bigger players like Nvidia and AMD have gone up 30 – 90% while smaller players around the AI industry, like quantum computing companies IONQ (46% YTD) and RGTI (132% YTD) or nuclear energy companies like UUUU (270%) and OKLO (648%) have gone up in greater magnitudes. It seems like whenever a big deal gets done involving AI, the company involved sees a big stock bump. Each of these AI companies are up well over 50% since June. Meanwhile, **Meta has been flat since June** and up 20% on the year. This indicates that Meta still has a lot of potential to run up as an AI play. For those that argue that Meta isn’t an AI play, Meta has just announced in October a $1.5b investment to build AI-focused datacenters in Texas, $14b agreement with AI cloud provider CoreWeave, and financing a $30b datacenter complex in Louisiana. **Given these recent Q3 investments, I believe a large focus of the Q3 earnings to be around how Meta will be a massive AI play (through providing AI-focused datacenters/infrastructure).** **Potential Issues** With any play, there will be concerns for the play moving in the opposite direction. These are what I see to be the biggest areas of concern for Wallstreet. 1. Large Capex spend – Wallstreet usually doesn’t like significant increases in spending. Note that this is actually also my second point for beating earnings. I believe it’ll be unlikely that Meta simply just says they are doubling capex without any support. In my mind, management will either show significant revenue increases or some other way to justify the increase in capex. 2. Ad Market Concerns – If Meta indicates weak ad demand for the upcoming quarter/year, then that can cause the stock to go down. However, I read recently that AI-powered recommendation models boosted conversions by upwards of 3-5%. Management could definitely use this justification as to why they are supporting AI. Given the magnitude of the capex increase from 2024-2026 though, I just don’t really see them communicating weak ad market demand. It just doesn’t really make sense to communicate a weakening market while simultaneously communicating massive spending increases. 3. User engagement risk – As a social media platform, investors look at Meta’s daily active users as an indication of Meta’s earning potential. Just last month, Zuckerberg announced a record high over 3b daily active users. There has been no real indication that user engagement is at risk. **The Play** **My play here is to hold a mix of Meta stocks and call options**. I have calls expiring 10/31 and 11/07 around the current price simply to capture my expected earnings boost, while my shares are there for long-term holding. One note: my personal opinion is that we are in an AI-bubble and at some point the bubble will likely burst. If that happens before Meta earnings comes out, our portfolios are probably already cooked anyways. Below are my positions: https://preview.redd.it/gyx11p4cthwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5914d0c907b930e0f1ee2031493e4172c891c17e Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

T,1ol1os1,stocks,"If AI spending dropped, couldn’t earnings be boosted to normalize PEs?","Everything I read, including my own sentiment, suggests the market is currently highly overvalued. PEs are very high compared to historical averages and buying at these valuations makes many nervous. I know many hate PEs because they don’t tell the full story, which is true, but they can be one of many tools to assess the market. Having said that, I’m always trying to play devils advocate, even with my own thesis. I’m trying to come up with scenarios that could normalize valuations without a crash, even ones that may seem improbable. I feel like it would be tough to generate enough revenue from AI to grow into their valuations. But what does seem feasible is the possibility of MAG7 cutting AI spending at some point. I know that seems highly improbable at the moment, but I feel like the unexpected is often what happens. If MAG7 cut AI spending (or reached economies of scale to reduce spending), it seems highly likely that their existing revenue streams, which are very strong, would remain intact. If that happened, their earnings would increase dramatically (via cost reduction but stable revenue) and their respective PEs would also trend towards normalization. What do you see happening long term? - AI revenue growing into valuations - AI spending reduced to normalize valuations - Significant market correction - A mix of the above",16,37,2025-10-31 18:02:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ol1os1/if_ai_spending_dropped_couldnt_earnings_be/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.805959,1.0,$T,0.9,[],"['earnings', 'revenue']",0.8114285714285714,Communication Services

T,1o6zdti,ValueInvesting,$GRRR - most undervalued AI play on the market,"Gorilla Technology (ticker: GRRR) could be the ONLY undervalued AI and data infrastructure stock in the entire market right with multi-bagger (2-5x) potential within the next few months. now especially with stocks like BBAI, RZLV, NBIS, APLD, IREN, CIFR, etc all up hundreds of % since April. The company sits around a $400 million market cap, yet holds over $100 million in cash, has minimal debt (~$16M) , and recently announced a $1.4 billion contract in Singapore. This isn’t a new startup trying to ride the AI wave. Gorilla has been around for more than twenty years, working with governments and major enterprises in AI, cybersecurity, and video analytics. They build the foundation that smart cities, national security systems, and AI-powered data centers run on. ⸻ ⭐️What Makes GRRR Different While companies like BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS have gained attention in the U.S., Gorilla has been quietly building dominance across Southeast Asia, particularly through government, security, and telecom contracts. Their AI-driven video analytics and infrastructure are already deployed in real national systems, not just in pilot phases. Now they are expanding internationally, and that’s where things get even more interesting, because Gorilla is involved in a massive global initiative called One Amazon. ⸻ ⭐️The One Amazon Project One Amazon isn’t connected to Amazon the company. It’s a large international initiative focused on uniting AI, sustainability, and digital finance to protect and regenerate the Amazon rainforest. It’s backed and supported by major organizations and partners including the White House, Goldman Sachs, AECOM, Chainlink, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). These names alone show that this project isn’t just another idea, it’s a coordinated global effort. What makes One Amazon especially interesting is its upcoming token launch, where each token represents one hectare of protected land. This gives it actual meaning, something that connects digital assets to real environmental impact. It’s not another meme coin or speculative token with no purpose. It’s meant to represent real-world sustainability value, linking financial markets directly to land conservation. The global launch and full presentation of the project are expected to happen at COP30 next month, one of the world’s most important climate events. If successful, this could be far more meaningful than any of the hype tokens** out there, because it represents something tangible and beneficial. Here’s where Gorilla comes in. Gorilla Technology is the primary technology provider for One Amazon, delivering the AI infrastructure, surveillance systems, and smart sensors that make the project possible. Their systems help monitor, protect, and manage the physical environments tied to the One Amazon token, ensuring transparency and security in how land and data are tracked. In simple terms, Gorilla isn’t just associated with One Amazon, they’re building the core technology that connects the physical world to the digital one. If One Amazon scales as expected, Gorilla’s name could become a household name around the world. There’s a video on the official One Amazon website that speaks volume about what this revolutionary project is about. I suggest everyone to go take a look. ⸻ ⭐️2025 Guidance and Growth Outlook Gorilla is giving strong guidance for 2025, signaling healthy growth ahead: Revenue: Expected between $100 million and $110 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA: Projected between $20 million and $25 million. Gross Margin: Expected to be 40–45%. Global Project Pipeline: Over $5 billion, with about $1 billion in contracts targeted for closure by mid-2026. These numbers show Gorilla isn’t just relying on hype or a single project. They have a clear growth plan backed by a large pipeline, major partnerships, and solid fundamentals. That recent $105 million registered direct offering at an offering price of $17.50 per share (current stock price is $18.4 as of today Oct 04, 2025), which closed in July 2025 and was led by a major institutional investor, gave them over 100 million in cash to accelerate growth. This not only strengthens their balance sheet but also provides the resources needed to execute on contracts and expand globally.A $1.4 billion contract in Singapore alone dwarfs their current market cap, making these projections very exciting for long-term holders. ⸻ ⭐️The Numbers Tell the Story At a $400 million market cap, Gorilla already has over $100 million in cash and very little debt. Compare that with BBAI, SOUN, APLD, and NBIS, which already trade at significantly higher valuations despite being no where close in realizing their projected revenues yet. That $1.4B Singapore contract alone is worth more than three times the company’s current market cap. Even if a fraction of it converts into revenue, it would dramatically shift Gorilla’s valuation metrics. On top of that, Gorilla was recently added to the S&P Global BMI Index, which could start attracting passive inflows and institutional attention. ⸻ ⭐️Why I Think It’s Special What stands out about Gorilla is that it’s not chasing headlines or trying to sell AI hype. They’re quietly building the infrastructure that other AI systems rely on. Their combination of strong balance sheet, government contracts, and global expansion positions them perfectly as demand for secure AI infrastructure continues to grow. If the One Amazon project goes live as planned at COP30 and Gorilla’s role becomes more publicly recognized, the company could easily re-rate from a small-cap to a serious mid-cap within the next couple of years. Yes, there’s still execution and volatility risk since it’s a smaller stock, but the combination of real contracts, credible partners, and meaningful global initiatives makes it feel like a hidden gem that the market hasn’t priced in yet. ⸻ ⭐️Why the Market Hasn’t Caught On Yet A big reason why GRRR is still so heavily discounted comes down to perception. It’s not a U.S. company, and most of its major customers are in Asia, which makes a lot of U.S. investors skeptical by default. People assume anything based in Asia with large government contracts can’t be fully trusted or verified, so the market automatically prices in a heavy “risk discount.” There have also been fraud allegations floating around earlier this year from short-seller reports. But when you actually dig into the details, most of those claims have already been debunked or proven exaggerated. The accusations didn’t hold up once the company released more filings and clarified contract details. Despite the noise, no regulatory body has found any wrongdoing, and the company continues to sign new partnerships and win major government deals. Shorts have been taking massive advantage of this sentiment to suppress the stock price but the spring is fully coiled and it is likely going to go off very soon, particularly when Q3 earnings is released mid-Nov. Then there’s CEO Jay Chandan. Some investors think he sounds too polished or too visionary to be real. He’s confident, ambitious, and talks about connecting AI, sustainability, and global infrastructure, which can sound like fluff to people used to hearing empty promises. But if you look at Gorilla’s actual results, long-term government contracts, real AI infrastructure deployments, and the One Amazon partnership, you start to see that there’s substance behind the story. Jay also comes across as empathetic, articulate, and long-term focused. He’s not your typical small-cap CEO chasing hype. And the people around him give the company serious credibility. Dr. Raj Natarajan, Gorilla’s current CTO, previously spent years at Microsoft leading product and engineering teams, and Thomas Sennhauser, Intel’s current CTO and Business Lead for Asia-Pacific, recently joined Gorilla’s Board of Directors. Before Intel, Sennhauser spent nearly two decades at HPE in senior technical leadership roles. If you want to dive deeper in the company’s credibility, you can take a look at this post Their core team includes engineers, AI researchers, and tech specialists who’ve been building advanced surveillance and infrastructure systems for more than two decades. This isn’t a new company trying to capitalize on AI hype, they’ve been quietly doing this work long before “AI infrastructure” became a buzzword. So yes, skepticism makes sense, and some of the CEO’s confidence might sound over the top at times. But when you step back and look at the fundamentals, the leadership, and the confirmed contracts, the valuation just doesn’t add up. It’s a rare case where skepticism might be creating one of the biggest asymmetrical opportunities out there. ⸻ ⭐️TL;DR Gorilla Technology (GRRR) is sitting at a $400M market cap with over $100M in cash, minimal debt (~$16M) and a $1.4B contract already signed. The current stock price is does not reflect their fundamentals at all. They are deeply involved in the One Amazon initiative, which includes partners like the White House, Goldman Sachs, Chainlink, AECOM, and the IDB, and will officially launch at COP30 next month, which will provide MASSIVE exposure to Gorilla. The project’s token represents one hectare of land, making it one of the world’s first digital assets with true real-world meaning. While everyone chases meme coins and overvalued AI stocks, Gorilla is quietly building the technology backbone for the future, combining surveillance, AI infrastructure, smart data centres, and sustainable finance to power real‑world projects on a global scale. It will be one of those companies people will look back on and realize the potential was obvious all along.

T,1o65niu,stocks,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out. Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment. Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy. They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that? Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results. But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K. So the real question is this: Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak? Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

T,1o815de,ValueInvesting,"Analysts expectations rise but stock still dropping, trying to understand WKL","Wolters Kluwer is a Dutch company that provides software, information, and services to professionals, earning money mainly through subscriptions and licenses. The stock took a hit after their CEO Nancy McKinstry announced she’s retiring in early 2026. Her replacement, Stacey Caywood, has been with the company for years and knows the business inside out, so I don't thinks it's a big deal, the transition will be smooth and the fundamentals of the company are still solid. The stock’s been hanging around €110, but analysts still have targets between €148–€165, with some even at €183. Revenue keeps growing — +6% last year, +7% in subscriptions and software, and cloud stuff even shot up 16%! They’re also doing a €1B share buyback in 2025. I’m almost certain the price will bounce back strongly, but one thing is bothering me: how come the price hasn’t shot back up much earlier? Feels like I’m missing something, or is everyone just waiting for the quarterly results on November 5th? I already own € 3300 worth in stock and want to invest more because I feel like I’m seeing a real opportunity, but that feeling keeps nagging me.

UNH,1o2vqzy,ValueInvesting,How I bought UNH before Buffett announced,"Steps I took: 1. Assess if their company's moat is now under pressure in the long run or if the situation is short-term. Conclusion: Healthcare industry will be intact unless a major change such as universal healthcare will be implemented by the government. Changes in regulation around healthcare may create short-term turbulence, but not enough to sway me from believing in the industry long-term. As for top management, Stephen Helmsley, I believe, is the correct person to manage the company during turbulent times. Lastly, did a relative analysis and found that UNH is operating way more efficient vs peers (8.1% operating margin vs nearest competitor 4.51%) 2. Do a conservative DCF and see if the company is below intrinsic value. (didn't use beta for cost of capital as I don't see it as a measure of risk for investments) Conclusion: At the time that I was analyzing the stock, it was before WSJ announced the fraud allegation and its price as at above $300. Saw this as undervalued already using my conservative DCF. 3. Bought UNH when I had cash and it is currently 40%\~ of my portfolio.

T,1onusx3,stocks,$TMC the next TRUMP trade?,"Initiated a new long position today in $TMC. This is a speculative event-driven play which has 5-6X potential though high risk of downside as well. The Metals Company (TMC): The intersection of geopolitics and precious metals: Company overview: TMC is a deep-sea mining firm aiming to harvest precious metals from the ocean floor. Its focus is on collecting polymetallic nodules (rock-like deposits rich in valuable metals) found in the Pacific. The company positions itself as a future supplier of materials critical for electric vehicles and renewable energy, offering a potential alternative to China’s dominance in global metal supply chains. *Note: It is estimated the addressable market of undersea metals globally could be as high as $20 trillion and TMC is the only company on earth who has the technical ability to mine it at scale. Bull thesis: 1. Strategic metals, unique source: TMC controls vast polymetallic nodule fields in the Pacific containing nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese all critical to EVs and grid storage. It’s essentially a one-stop shop for the metals the West currently depends on China for. 2. Competitive advantage: TMC is the only company that has the technical ability to mine ocean floor at scale. 3. Geopolitical tailwind: With U.S.–China trade tensions escalating and Beijing’s stranglehold on critical minerals, TMC could become a strategic asset. There’s a real chance Trump pushes for domestic control of these resources possibly through a U.S. government equity stake or funding, similar to how the DPA (Defense Production Act) has been used to secure other materials. 4. Precedence: Trump admin has already take equity stakes in other metals companies including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals but none of these companies offer ocean-floor mining. 5. Regulatory momentum: TMC has already filed for U.S. permits and continues to work under the International Seabed Authority framework, putting it ahead of potential competitors if rules are finalized or the U.S. decides to act independently. Catalyst: The White House has issued executive actions and invoked authorities to accelerate critical mineral production and has deployed non-market tools (loan guarantees, DPA, DFC, even minority equity in select miners), signaling political willingness to take stronger measures to secure supply chains. If policymakers treat polymetallic nodules as strategically important, direct equity/financing or government partnerships could follow. I expect announcement over coming weeks/months. Analyst ratings: Most notably Wedbush (early Palantir bull) has rated TMC with a “buy” and $11 price target. But they would quickly re-rate company into the $20s if US gov takes equity stake or Trump allows them to have permit. - Cantor, Alliance Global, and HC Wainwright also have buy rating on the stock. Risks: This is a binary play. I won't be in this long. Either they will get gov stake / permit or they won't. Bottom-line: This is a high-risk, high-reward investment which I believe plays beautifully into ongoing precious metals / China trade tension narrative coupled with Trump administration’s desire to be more aggressive with de-regulation and pursuing any avenue to decrease China leverage over US supply chains. Stock is down 30% from recent highs, and I have initiated a position at $6.50 with intent to begin selling in the $20s.

BA,1onakf7,ValueInvesting,Sandvik (Swedish mining equipment & machining tools maker) [Part 3],"*This is the third post of a serie of at least 6 posts on mining & construction equipment. The first posts were about* [*Epiroc*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ni0qk3/epiroc_swedish_mining_equipment_serial_acquirer/) *and* [*Caterpillar*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nt1y65/caterpillar_post_24/) *. If you are only interested in something to buy TODAY, then no need to read this post.* **Sandvik** is a swedish company making equipment for the mining industry, rock processing and machining industry. It was founded in 1862. They started their mining/construction/rock processing activities with some rock tools that were mounted on Atlas Copco (now Epiroc since the 2018 spin-off) machines. Atlas Copco was the one with access to the customers and Sandvik was selling to Atlas Copco. They ended the partnership in 1989, after Atlas Copco bought Secoroc, a direct competitor to Sandvik Rock Tools. Sandvik made a new partnership with Tamrock. Sandvik bought progressivly Tamrock in 1989+1996+1997. In the meantime, Tamrock bought Rammer and Roxon in 1995. The Rock tools / Mining & Construction business area (BA) was 8% of sales in 1994, 10% in 1997, 28% in 2002, 41% in 2007... In august 2022, the company spin-off their Materials Technology BA, now named Alleima. It was 13% of group sales in 2021. ***Mining Solutions BA*** The Mining Solutions BA has made acquisitions in recent years. It made 51% of the sales in 2024. \* 5 acquisitions in the Digital Mining Technologies Division (2019, 2022, 2023, 2023, 2024) \* DSI Underground for 943 M€ in 2021. It makes reinforcement/safety solutions for mine ceiling. This is the new Ground Support Division. An other acquisition for Ground Support was made in 2023. \* 6 other acquisitions, 2 of which are related to battery/electrification. ***Rock Processing Solutions BA*** The BA was created in 2020. Before that it was the Crushing & Screening Division in the Mining & Rock BA. It made 9% of sales in 2024. The biggest acquisition was Shanbao in 2011. The group also bought Kwatani in 2021, SP Mining in 2022 and a italian demolition tools manufacturer (OSA Demolition) in 2025. ***Manufacturing & Machining Solutions BA*** The BA has been divided into 2 segments in 2021 : Machining and Intelligent Manufacturing. *Machining* The machining activities started in 1942 with the creation of Sandvik Coromant. Coromant made 11 add-on acquisitions since 2013. Sandvik started buying Seco Tools in 1974. In the 2000's, Sandvik's share was about 60%. The group bought the remaining shares in 2012. Seco made 4 add-on acquisitions in recent years. German company Walter was bought in 2001. Walter made 3 add-on in recent years. In addition to these 3 add-on, american company GWS have been bought in 2021 with 2 add-on in 2022. GWS is its own business unit since 2024. Dormer Pramet is the 2014 merger of Dormer, bought in 1992, and Pramet, bought by Seco Tools in 1999. 2 add-on have been made in recent years. The Powder solutions business unit is comprised mainly of Wolfram (bought in 2009?), with one add-on in 2023. *Intelligent manufacturing* The intelligent manufacturing activities may have started in 2018 with the acquisition of Metrologic Group. The group has made 3 other acquisitions in the Industrial Metrology division. The Design and Planning Automation division is composed of at least Mastercam, bought in 2021, with a lot of add-on since (mostly resellers of Mastercam). The group also bought Cambrio in 2021. **Asset allocation** The company is distributing about 46% of their earnings. They don't really make share buybacks. The average equity ratio is 50%. They make a lot of acquisitions, even though they are not the most active serial acquirer. **Shareholders, Management & Board** *Management* The CEO is Stefan Widing, hired in 2020. He was previously head of HID at Assa Abloy, a swedish serial acquirer of locks and related products. HID is their business unit focussed on RFID, ID issuance technology etc. Cecilia Felton joined the group in 2013 and has been appointed CFO in november 2021. Mats Eriksson is the president of the Mining BA since october 2022. He was previously president of the Load and Haul division in the same BA since 2016. Richard Harris has been named president of the Rock Processing BA in october 2022. He joined the group in 2002 and was president of Walter in 2019-2022 (in Machining). Nadine Crauwels was named president of the Machining segment in october 2020. She was previously president of Coromant in 2017-2020 in the same segment. Mattias Nillson has been named president of the Intelligent Manufacturing segment in may 2023. He joined the group in 2007. *Board* The main shareholders has 3/8 seats. One other interesting board member is Andreas Nordbrandt, who worked at Atlas/Epiroc from 1995 to 2018 (at the end : president of Rocktech and then president of Underground Rock Excavation) *Shareholders* The biggest shareholder of Sandvik is Industrivärden, a publicly traded holding. In 1997, Industrivärden used to own 8.5% of Sandvik and the number has increased almost every year with some fluctuations. It now owns 14.6% of Sandvik. Industrivärden is controlled by Lundbergföretagen, also a publicly traded holding controlled by the Lundberg family. Lundbergföretagen used to directly own 0.8% of Sandvik in 2006 and the number has often increased. Lundbergföretagen now directly owns 3.1%. So the total controlled by the Lundberg family is 17.7% of Sandvik. tldr : continuity **Some numbers** The profitability is strictly lower than Epiroc's every year : 12.7% (18), 8.27% (19), 10.11% (20), 14.59% (21), 9.98% (22), 12.09% (23), 9.96% (24). In average, they generate sales close to 75% of their balance sheet total in the beggining of the year. Conclusion : they may pay slightly too much for their acquisitions. **Conclusion** I think that the company is not undervalued at a P/E 24.26. It is the same price as Epiroc (24.52). It is an average serial acquirer.",2,0,2025-11-03 12:35:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1onakf7/sandvik_swedish_mining_equipment_machining_tools/,2025-11-07 16:45:54.969502,1.0,$BA,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'support', 'profit', 'merger', 'acquisition']",0.6285714285714286,Industrials

They have a low debt ratio, slightly elevated P/S and P/B but they’re a cloud saas company so to me that’s expected? The predicted eps next year is 25%, they have good margins and insiders hold a decent share which shows belief to me. They have competition but it seems like they rank fairly competitive to others and since they technically operate “globally” (Canada, USA, Mexico, and a bit in India) this should have less of an effect.

AMZN,1ojag2j,stocks,Absolutely everything you need to know about MSFT earnings,"Okay, so it's finally time. With earning season ramping up, we have a bunch of techies going off today. MSFT, GOOG, and META are literally *all today*. So I wanted to put in my 2 cents for MSFT for those who are thinking of gambling. Right now the consensus is * Earnings per share: $3.67 * Revenue: $75.33 billion Analysts are expecting Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure and other cloud services, to pull in $12.8 billion for the quarter. [Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business. Microsoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago. During the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025. From my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure. They often mention Microsoft’s ongoing infrastructure projects and said that if the sites all get deployed, they could result in $30 billion to $40 billion in incremental annual revenue for the company. As you guys already know, much of Microsoft’s AI momentum has been attributed to its tight relationship with OpenAI. New terms in OpenAI deal = new opportunities After some negotiation, [OpenAI announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/open-ai-for-profit-microsoft.html) that Microsoft updated its $13 billion partnership with them, essentially restructuring and formally outlined Microsoft’s stake in the company. Under the new structure, OpenAI’s nonprofit will hold a 26% stake in its for-profit arm, worth about $130 billion. Microsoft will hold a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, and current and former employees and investors will own the remaining 47%. They still retains its slice of OpenAI’s revenue in the agreement, which Bloomberg has [reported to be 20%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/microsoft-to-get-27-of-openai-access-to-ai-models-until-2032), but that would end if they somehow achieve AGI (which an independent expert would confirm). And they still has IP rights for OpenAI’s models and products that will now extend to 2032, and access to research IP rights (how they build their models) until 2030, unless AGI is achieved. That allows it to continue to use the state-of-the-art AI in all of its existing products for the foreseeable future. This is an insanely strong position in the AI industry, even if talk of an [AI bubble](https://sherwood.news/markets/everyone-is-admitting-the-ai-boom-might-be-a-bubble/) turns out to be true. Having the uncertainty of such an important deal resolved brings some clarity to the larger AI landscape and creates some new opportunities for Microsoft. Microsoft is now free to pursue AGI on its own, or with partners. Up until now, Microsoft has mostly embraced OpenAI’s technology for use in its products (like [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)), and doesn’t really have a large flagship AI model of its own yet (though it has built smaller, specialized models like [Phi](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi) and [MAI-1](https://microsoft.ai/news/two-new-in-house-models/)). OpenAI is also agreeing to purchase $250 billion worth of Azure computing (yup, that again) as part of the reworked deal. But one thing could hurt Microsoft: it has given up its right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s main computing partner. That could mean losing a lot of business from the industry leader if OpenAI takes its compute to a competitor or uses its own [Stargate](https://sherwood.news/tech/rising-ambitions-and-skyrocketing-costs-heres-what-we-know-about-project/) data centers. So what do we do for earnings? Microsoft stock has moved an average of nearly 6% following its four most recent earnings reports. In July, shares rose about 4% the day after [the company reported better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-earnings-4q-fy2025-11782019) driven by cloud computing growth. Shares jumped more than 7% on [similarly strong results](https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-earnings-q3-fy2025-11724456) in April. With analysts expecting Microsoft to report another quarter of strong revenue and earnings growth, so for the option traders here, I think we should get calls. We're basically all overwhelmingly bullish on Microsoft’s stock. If anyone is interested, I plan on also posting about RDDT and AMZN earnings tomorrow.

UNH,1ok7888,financialindependence,Alternatives to ACA,"I know there are a lot of ACA threads talking about prices in 2026 and many of those are helpful, but I am wondering about whether it is starting to make sense to more seriously explore alternatives outside of ACA, especially for those of us who are above the threshold to receive subsidies. I want to preface by saying that I am NOT super knowledgeable about any of this, I am posting this more to learn than to provide information myself. I am 45M, single, stopped working 4 years ago. I'm currently on an HSA qualifying ACA silver plan, it's an EPO and I've been reasonably happy with it, price was in the $500s/mo range (unsubsidized) from '22-'24 and jumped to $675/mo in '25, looks like the same plan will be $950/mo in '26, looks like some comparable HSA qualifying Bronze EPOs are in the mid $800s range or a Bronze HMO (myblue) for mid $500s. I'm not sure how bad an HMO would be for me, I've never had one. If specialists I want to see aren't covered by the HMO I'm not opposed to just paying out of pocket for routine stuff. Also, Blue told me the cheaper Bronze HMO plan will not be HSA eligible even though they first confirmed all Bronze plans would be (""yes, all Bronze plans will be HSA eligible next year ... oh, not that one""). Google had similar confusing results, first saying all bronze plans would be HSA eligible next year then when I googled the specific plan changed to saying ""most"" bronze plans will be HSA eligible next year. HSA eligibility is nice to have but I guess not absolutely necessary. The deduction is probably worth about $100/mo to me ($4400 ordinary income at 10% bracket plus would push $4400 of gains / divs from 0% to 15% bracket, so 25% effective tax rate on $4400), the longer term tax favorability is not as meaningful as something like buy and hold VTI in taxable isn't exactly tax inefficient and there's a lot of hassle to holding receipts for 30 years to pull from an HSA, plus those receipts lose value to inflation over time and there's some risk money gets ""stuck"" in the HSA which has unfavorable inheritance treatment. My view of insurance is different from how many view health insurance - IMO insurance is for catastrophic financial loss. In an ideal world, I'd buy a catastrophic only policy and just pay cash out of pocket for all routine health care and have insurance in case of really expensive, low probability events. I'm currently healthy. Alternatives as far as I understand them - looking for people w/ experience or knowledge about any of these: 1). Short term plans. Just going to UNH website for example, it looks like 12 month ST plans for my age from the low \~$200s/mo, these are high deductible / high OOP max plans which as I said I'm fine with, you can also scale the deductible down for higher premiums. It appears they are not HSA eligible. I am guessing the network is pretty good given UNH network? Don't cover preexisting conditions but this does not seem to be a concern to me as I'm healthy ... I guess the concern would be, do they use this to weasel out of coverage? I.e. let's say I buy the plan and 6 months later get diagnosed with something new i.e. at least the knowledge of it is new, will they try and claim that was preexisting even though I get regular checkups and it was never caught before? Is there something I'm missing about these plans i.e. are they too good to be true? At first glance this seems like a better deal than my ACA plan even at 2025 pricing. 2). Farm Bureau plans. My state does not currently offer these, but recently (earlier this year) passed legislation to offer them, apparently it will be through Farm Bureau of TN (I don't live in TN) ... I called them and they said they don't offer in my state yet but are planning to in the not distant future, couldn't give me a timeline. You can enroll at any time so if not available by year end I could get an ACA plan during open enrollment and switch to FB plan later when available. Anyone have experience with these? Is it legit? Do doctors/hospitals actually accept it, is the network decent etc? 3).

UNH,1oh2f6k,ValueInvesting,Wendy's Is a 3x+ Bagger From Current Prices,"Wendy's is trading at a 9 PE, and has superior burgers to all the other QSR burgers. With how expensive fast food has gotten, people will expect higher quality from their fast food, and this is where Wendy's never frozen beef shines. Average QSR pe right now is 27. Wendy's has a massive amount of branding and stores, and recently is working with the man who managed to turn Taco Bell around from the gutter with his Dorito Taco Bell offering. I see Wendy's as a minimum 2x bagger from here, and if sentiment turns around for Wendy's we'll see it going 3-4x. If Wendy's cuts their dividend they'll be able to get their P/E even lower by paying down debt. People thought UNH was dead at a 15 P/E just a few months ago, I believe Wendy's will triple people's money with their Project Fresh initiative that they announced 2 weeks ago. The stock has put in a bottom since that announcement, and management seems extremely focused on turning sentiment around with new marketing and branding. American Eagle's stock price doubled just from a Sidney Sweeney ad; the market is extremely pessimistic on Wendy's. Moreover, a moonshot could happen if Trump decides to have the government invest in Wendy's, we have seen Trump serve Wendy's at the White House in the past. I full ported into AMD and UNH this year when sentiment was at absolute lows, and it is clear that WEN is currently at eye watering lows, and is definitely an acquisition target. Warren Buffet has publicly stated that he eats Wendy's as well. If Buffet buys in the stock will do a 50% move just like UNH did, just food for thought.

T,1obruch,ValueInvesting,"Most comprehensive DD on a future tenbagger, deep value under the radar company that Peter Lynch would like is $PROP an oil and gas company","**updated today, 11/01/25** Prairie Operating Co (PROP) is an energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States. They have 60+ employees now, not 19 and do most things inhouse now after the Bayswater acquisition. Biggest risks with PROP are Series F redemptions and management not executing. Series F preferred stock being redeemed into common shares will dilute shareholders badly but management will use their credit facilities and cash flow to pay off Series F holders in cash. Debt for preferred stock is on PROP balance sheet right now and PROP just needs to pay off the stock with debt from somewhere else like from RBL and the high yield debt market. So the debt would stay or be a little higher in the balance sheet but there would be no more dilution. PROP sold preferred shares and warrants to fund a 600m acquisition of assets in the DJ basin from Baywater. PROP had a market cap of 200m before the acquisition but is valued at 100m today. Oil exposure is well hedged through early 2028 so there is no commodity pricing risk. Management wouldn’t let PROP holdings be diluted as insiders own 30% - 50% of the company. The co-founders and executive team are very large equity shareholders. PROP has publicly stated that they are working towards eliminating the dilution overhang associated with the preferred stock. Series F holders may convert all or a portion of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock at any time but they wouldn’t do that as they are collecting a 12% dividend for holding preferred shares. They also wouldn’t dare to do an ATM at this bad valuation. PROP has access to borrow a maximum of 475m from a Reserve-Based Lending (RBL) Credit Facility. They currently are borrowing 386m which helped fund the Baywater assets acquisition. They also owe 129m to Series F holders. Series F will need to be paid off all at once to prevent massive shareholder dilution. With a new evaluation coming in the next month or two, PROP should be able to borrow more than 85m from RBL and they can borrow the rest from the high yield debt market. They will be able to get a loan with all the assets they have including 1.3b in proven oil reserves. Total oil reserves could be 2.4b but only proven oil reserves qualify for a RBL loan. The loan limit will be raised because the rate set for PROP was lower than industry standards. The rate was set that way because PROP was not a proven executor and with Q2 results they have proven themselves. AI is driving really profound growth in data centers and all that electricity is predominantly being generated by fossil fuels. So there is still demand for oil and gas. The oil and gas industry is not dying. PROP is excellent at acquisitions and buys them at 2 to 2.5 multiples. They are always looking for deals. And competitors are paying a 4 or more multiple on acquisitions. PROP revenue reached 68.1m in Q2 2025. Production reached about 21,000 barrels of oil per day. PROP's goal is to get to about 100,000 barrels a day. They produce on average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day so far. By the end of 2025 with their 600m acquisition the output should be much higher. They have hedges covering 85% of PDP production for 2025 through 2028 for an average price of $65 a barrel. Future barrels are hedged at least at $60 a barrel. PROP will spend 300m a year on capex. In 2026, the cash flow that they generate is going to exceed that capex. PROP’s will do dividends or buybacks in the future after they deleverage and pay down debt. Their goal is to return value to their shareholders and keep leverage lowering than the competition. Colorado has an abundance of electricity from renewables. Colorado also has strict emissions/pollution standards. Partnership with ProFrac gives Prairie access to an electric frac fleet allowing hydraulic fracturing and pump down operations to be fully electrified. The fleet will be equipped with electric blender units, hydration systems and chemical additive units all powered by 100% natural gas and not diesel. Prairie wants all operations from drilling to production to be fully electric. -------- I compared the Q2 results of many other oil and gas companies with similar market caps. https://imgur.com/a/azx79xO Here are some Q2 results against some non-oil and gas companies https://imgur.com/a/N6tqywc -------- Prairie Operating Co. was co-founded by Gary C. Hanna and Edward Kovalik, who currently serve as President and Chairman/CEO, respectively. As of October 2025, Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ: PROP) has 50.28 million common shares outstanding Board of Directors / Management / Co-founders and other shareholders who have been with PROP since or near inception owned 55% of the company. If the Series F shares are redeemed. Not only do the insiders lose millions they also would fail to gain the hundreds of millions that they would have gained from eliminating the dilution risk. There is a very very high chance the Series F preferred shares will not be redeemed. Insiders like Jonathan H. Gray have recently bought shares as recently as this September. List of shareholders, their holdings and relation to PROP https://imgur.com/a/9zbgw0V -------- The DJ Basin in Colorado is subject to strict emissions regulations, including a state-wide rule to reduce the oil and gas industry's contribution to ground-level ozone by 50% by 2030 compared to 2017 levels. The state has implemented regulations that require producers to cut emissions intensity, upgrade equipment, and manage flaring, and some companies are adopting additional technologies to further reduce their environmental impact. PROP uses pipelines, electric frack fleet, continuous monitoring and many other technologies to follow Colorado’s strict emission standards while maintaining high margins. Chevron is attempting to sell pipeline assets in the Denver-Julesburg (D-J) Basin in Colorado starting on Oct 3. 2025, with a Reuters report estimating they could fetch more than $2 billion. Big oil doesn’t want to compete in the DJ Basin. DJ Basin is run by mid to small oil producers. PROP acquired certain assets from Edge Energy in July 2025 in an off-market transaction for $12.5 million in cash, funded through the Company’s credit facility, resulting in a non-dilutive transaction for shareholders. The Edge Energy acquisition represents a strategic addition of approximately 11,000 net acres to expand Prairie’s DJ Basin footprint to approximately 60,000 net acres. The attractive mix of current production and future development of the Edge Energy assets enhances Prairie’s inventory depth, accelerates near-term development plans, and supports continued cash flow growth. -------- **origins** With no one minding Chevron’s leases in the region, they began to expire. That’s when a small team known to Mr Kovalik began buying up as many of the newly available leases as possible. “Chevron wasn’t quick on the draw to renew them, but there’s always someone scrappy in the US that is following something like this,” he said. “The team kept buying until Chevron noticed what was happening and started renewing all the other leases they hadn’t let go – by the time they figured it out, they’d already lost 37,000 acres.” “We offered them the same price Chevron was offering them, only with an additional point of royalties. On that basis that we shook hands and had a deal.” Over the past decade, Kovalik has made a career on Wall Street helping finance energy companies moving from conventional oil and gas extraction to new, capital-intensive fracking. “I was always looking for a contrarian approach to make outsized returns,” he said. “The flight to safety in the Permian Basin [in Texas] is now just a safe place to invest, but it’s not a place you can generate outsized returns any more.” Mr Kovalik expects to start production by the end of the year, with plans to grow the company into a multibillion-dollar, mid-cap producer within three years. “The plan for the company is to grow as aggressively as we can. If someone wants to buy us, fantastic. If not, we’ll just return a lot of cash flow to investors,” he said. -------- **Q2 disaster explanation** “We are accustomed to misinterpreting guidance on occasion, but it appears that all sell-side analysts misinterpreted comments from the company about run-rate production in March at the closing of the Bayswater acquisition. “We acknowledge the growing pains of a new organization but believe that the uniformly incorrect modeling of all sell-side analysts suggests a failure by management to provide sufficient context on timing nuances related to the acquisition.” Prairie’s D&C plans are weighted to this half of 2025, Kovalik said. It’s expecting full-year 2025 production to average between 24,000 boe/d and 26,000 boe/d, “which we stand by.” “So even though we closed it on March 26, we're just now settling because we had a transition services agreement with Bayswater to operate the assets through last month.” The extended transition was while Prairie had fewer than 20 employees. “We weren't staffed as a team to absorb the assets and operate them.” Now, though, the E&P has 60 employees. “We brought over part and parcel pretty much all of Bayswater’s field personnel who were operating the asset. So we've got great continuity in the field managing that.” It has now “put in place all of our own systems from the ground up. … From a systems perspective, everyone that's done a significant amount of M&A knows exactly what I'm talking about.” Now up and running, Kovalik expects Prairie will grow to 100,000 bbl/d in the next few years. “But the reality is that, to date, very little of that preferred stock has converted. Only a few million dollars. And we expect very little to convert on a go-forward basis because we've been public in talking about our intentions to redeem that stock long before we would ever have to issue the warrants. … “So I think we can really assuage investors’ concerns about the dilutive effect of the preferred by eliminating it.” -------- I have compiled and edited the best bits of various interviews PROP did in the past few months. I used audio transcription software and grouped together similar information. Everything below is from interviews. I don't think what people understand is that everything that we basically use is a product of oil. The world runs on hydrocarbons and it's across the board. Plastics, medicines and so on. The majority of electricity that's driven by hydrocarbons is primarily from natural gas. So I think without oil, we would be in heap trouble and lost as a society without it. We think that hydrocarbons are going to fill that energy void of datacenters. Oil is super cheap right now. We think there's a super cycle coming maybe as soon as the fourth quarter of 2026 and maybe a little bit beyond that. 2026 is really the transition year where we break into cash flow positivity and we generate more cash than our capex. We are still growing acreage. I think we're up to 60,000 acres now. We intend to keep growing that organically. Those leases are our lifeblood to the future. We try to keep a 10-year inventory of up to 5,600 well locations in our inventory at any given time that we can permit over the course of a year. We think there's a lot of farmout potential to do with Oxy and Chevron. We have constant dialogues with them about projects that we're working on. They look at our cost structure relative to theirs, our takeaway capacity that we have contracted, our ability to manage and produce water because we control our own saltwater disposal systems, things that even them at their size do not have, at least in that particular area. -------- **Compiled information related to costs.** The more we underwrote the Permian, the more we came to the conclusion that the returns that other acquirers were satisfied with were low double digits. Whereas in the DJ Basin, we saw returns that were substantially higher than that, really driven by two things. The lower cost to acquire assets and then just the drilling economics. The rocks in the DJ Basin in the Codell and the Niobrera are really easy to drill compared to the Permian. In Colorado, where we are, we drill these two mile lateral wells between 4-5 days. By comparison in the Permian, it takes 10-14 days to drill a similar well. And we've been able to drive down all the other costs associated with drilling, starting with the frack fleet. We're blessed with approximately 600 drilling locations. 20% IRR to over a 100% IRR per location. Costs between 5.2 to 5.4 million to develop a well. All the way down from 6.5 to 7 million when we were starting the company. We're running one rig full time, which translates into drilling about 60 wells per year. We've paid as little as $10,000 to $100,000 for a proven location to drill in the DJ basin. In the Permian basin, people are paying millions of dollars for the same location, same economics. They're spending $3 to $5 million just to buy that location. We put most of our products (oil, gas and water) directly into pipelines from production. We have access to about 40 megawatts of power that no one was really using from windmills and other renewables. It's a lot cheaper to use electricity than burning a lot of diesel, which has helped drive our cost structure really low. Our competitive advantage is tremendous out here, especially at $60 oil or $55 oil. We think we can produce profitably down into the 40s, probably the low 40s, but after that, we're just not going to drill wells at $42. -------- **Compiled information on Baywater, 600m acquisition** We grew about 9x to 10x through the Bayswater acquisition. We went from 14 people to 62 people. The integration has gone really great. We went from relying on consultants to whom we outsource a lot of what we do before the deal to now bringing it inhouse. We setted up our own systems from the ground up which is great because we didn't inherit someone else's accounting system and someone else's land system. We didn't have to figure all that out. We took about 90 days to integrate Baywater assets. We've moved on towards optimization of the assets that we acquired. We've been doing gas lift optimization projects. We also have been doing workovers which we'll continue to do between now and the end of the year. We've got some low hanging fruit to exploit some inefficiencies in the assets and get a little bit more productivity out of them. So at the time we did the last acquisition, which was a $600 million acquisition. It was more than 10 times the size of our company. A minnow swallowing a whale kind of a deal, it's tough to finance that. We got a great bank syndicate together led by Citibank to fund most of the deal. Our preferred shareholders come in for $150 million to finance the rest of that deal. We have the ability to redeem this financing. We're now significantly larger than at the time we did that acquisition. Not only as a result of having done the acquisition, but also because we're growing substantially through the drill bit. And as a result, we have access to lower cost of capital. We're working tirelessly to eliminate the overhang of the preferred stock. I would point investors to the fact that very little of the preferred investment has actually converted into shares. -------- The oil and gas industry is the least expensive industry on the SP500, yet generates the greatest amount of cashflow as a percentage of business than any industry on the SP500. There is no energy transition, only an energy addition. I think we're a mispriced industry. There's just not an unlimited inventory of cheap oil. We don't need a huge reinvestment in the energy sector to see a huge re-rate in oil and gas prices. All we need is a little bit of capital flowing back into this sector to see these prices jump 10%, 20%, 30% in short order. We think there's a fundamental scarcity value to the commodity. We're running out of inventory. And that's why we're trying to get our hands on every great location we can. From the beginning, our plan has been to consolidate the DJ Basin and to build a high-growth company, through acquisitions and through the drill bit. We've done eight acquisitions in just the last two years. But we're now beginning to grow significantly through the drill bit. We really just started that program in April and May of 2025 after our last acquisition, which is our largest acquisition. And so we're really hitting exit velocity going in the back half of this year into next year where we see a future where our cash flows start to surpass our capex. And we're all about returning capital to shareholders. We ourselves are large investors in the company. We love dividend income. So that's our focus. We are under-levered compared to a lot of peers. We have no intention to become over-levered. Our vision is to continue consolidating, but also to top off and return cash flow. The stock is trading very low with the market assuming full conversion of $129 million of the preferred shares. But we're not afraid that that's going to happen because of our ability to buy out the preferred shares. And the financial markets are suppressing the price of oil. We've got a really historic level of shorts in the market. But none of the facts on the ground really reflect it. There's fear of this OPEC glut. If there was going to be a glut of oil from OPEC, you would have already seen it in the storage numbers and you're not seeing them. So I think there's a lag in terms of the market catching up with reality. We're experiencing that lag right now. And make no mistake, based on historic movements, this commodity can shoot up $20 or $30 over a very short period of time. We're putting our money where our mouth is. Every window of opportunity we have, we're all buying stock, even though we own a lot of it to date. Not every executive on the team is required to file a purchase. We remain excited about the M&A environment. We're at a great financial position. We're really well hedged. We've got nothing but good things to look forward to as a company.",37,33,2025-10-20 19:53:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1obruch/most_comprehensive_dd_on_a_future_tenbagger_deep/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.095083,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.6,['PROP'],"['dividend', 'shorts', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'acquisition']",0.84,Communication Services

PROP acquired certain assets from Edge Energy in July 2025 in an off-market transaction for $12.5 million in cash, funded through the Company’s credit facility, resulting in a non-dilutive transaction for shareholders. The Edge Energy acquisition represents a strategic addition of approximately 11,000 net acres to expand Prairie’s DJ Basin footprint to approximately 60,000 net acres. The attractive mix of current production and future development of the Edge Energy assets enhances Prairie’s inventory depth, accelerates near-term development plans, and supports continued cash flow growth. -------- **origins** With no one minding Chevron’s leases in the region, they began to expire. That’s when a small team known to Mr Kovalik began buying up as many of the newly available leases as possible. “Chevron wasn’t quick on the draw to renew them, but there’s always someone scrappy in the US that is following something like this,” he said. “The team kept buying until Chevron noticed what was happening and started renewing all the other leases they hadn’t let go – by the time they figured it out, they’d already lost 37,000 acres.” “We offered them the same price Chevron was offering them, only with an additional point of royalties. On that basis that we shook hands and had a deal.” Over the past decade, Kovalik has made a career on Wall Street helping finance energy companies moving from conventional oil and gas extraction to new, capital-intensive fracking. “I was always looking for a contrarian approach to make outsized returns,” he said. “The flight to safety in the Permian Basin [in Texas] is now just a safe place to invest, but it’s not a place you can generate outsized returns any more.” Mr Kovalik expects to start production by the end of the year, with plans to grow the company into a multibillion-dollar, mid-cap producer within three years. “The plan for the company is to grow as aggressively as we can. If someone wants to buy us, fantastic. If not, we’ll just return a lot of cash flow to investors,” he said. -------- **Q2 disaster explanation** “We are accustomed to misinterpreting guidance on occasion, but it appears that all sell-side analysts misinterpreted comments from the company about run-rate production in March at the closing of the Bayswater acquisition. “We acknowledge the growing pains of a new organization but believe that the uniformly incorrect modeling of all sell-side analysts suggests a failure by management to provide sufficient context on timing nuances related to the acquisition.” Prairie’s D&C plans are weighted to this half of 2025, Kovalik said. It’s expecting full-year 2025 production to average between 24,000 boe/d and 26,000 boe/d, “which we stand by.” “So even though we closed it on March 26, we're just now settling because we had a transition services agreement with Bayswater to operate the assets through last month.” The extended transition was while Prairie had fewer than 20 employees. “We weren't staffed as a team to absorb the assets and operate them.” Now, though, the E&P has 60 employees. “We brought over part and parcel pretty much all of Bayswater’s field personnel who were operating the asset. So we've got great continuity in the field managing that.” It has now “put in place all of our own systems from the ground up. … From a systems perspective, everyone that's done a significant amount of M&A knows exactly what I'm talking about.” Now up and running, Kovalik expects Prairie will grow to 100,000 bbl/d in the next few years. “But the reality is that, to date, very little of that preferred stock has converted. Only a few million dollars. And we expect very little to convert on a go-forward basis because we've been public in talking about our intentions to redeem that stock long before we would ever have to issue the warrants. … “So I think we can really assuage investors’ concerns about the dilutive effect of the preferred by eliminating it.” -------- I have compiled and edited the best bits of various interviews PROP did in the past few months. I used audio transcription software and grouped together similar information. Everything below is from interviews. I don't think what people understand is that everything that we basically use is a product of oil. The world runs on hydrocarbons and it's across the board. Plastics, medicines and so on. The majority of electricity that's driven by hydrocarbons is primarily from natural gas. So I think without oil, we would be in heap trouble and lost as a society without it. We think that hydrocarbons are going to fill that energy void of datacenters. Oil is super cheap right now. We think there's a super cycle coming maybe as soon as the fourth quarter of 2026 and maybe a little bit beyond that. 2026 is really the transition year where we break into cash flow positivity and we generate more cash than our capex. We are still growing acreage. I think we're up to 60,000 acres now. We intend to keep growing that organically. Those leases are our lifeblood to the future. We try to keep a 10-year inventory of up to 5,600 well locations in our inventory at any given time that we can permit over the course of a year. We think there's a lot of farmout potential to do with Oxy and Chevron. We have constant dialogues with them about projects that we're working on. They look at our cost structure relative to theirs, our takeaway capacity that we have contracted, our ability to manage and produce water because we control our own saltwater disposal systems, things that even them at their size do not have, at least in that particular area. -------- **Compiled information related to costs.** The more we underwrote the Permian, the more we came to the conclusion that the returns that other acquirers were satisfied with were low double digits. Whereas in the DJ Basin, we saw returns that were substantially higher than that, really driven by two things. The lower cost to acquire assets and then just the drilling economics. The rocks in the DJ Basin in the Codell and the Niobrera are really easy to drill compared to the Permian. In Colorado, where we are, we drill these two mile lateral wells between 4-5 days. By comparison in the Permian, it takes 10-14 days to drill a similar well. And we've been able to drive down all the other costs associated with drilling, starting with the frack fleet. We're blessed with approximately 600 drilling locations. 20% IRR to over a 100% IRR per location. Costs between 5.2 to 5.4 million to develop a well. All the way down from 6.5 to 7 million when we were starting the company. We're running one rig full time, which translates into drilling about 60 wells per year. We've paid as little as $10,000 to $100,000 for a proven location to drill in the DJ basin. In the Permian basin, people are paying millions of dollars for the same location, same economics. They're spending $3 to $5 million just to buy that location. We put most of our products (oil, gas and water) directly into pipelines from production. We have access to about 40 megawatts of power that no one was really using from windmills and other renewables. It's a lot cheaper to use electricity than burning a lot of diesel, which has helped drive our cost structure really low. Our competitive advantage is tremendous out here, especially at $60 oil or $55 oil. We think we can produce profitably down into the 40s, probably the low 40s, but after that, we're just not going to drill wells at $42. -------- **Compiled information on Baywater, 600m acquisition** We grew about 9x to 10x through the Bayswater acquisition. We went from 14 people to 62 people. The integration has gone really great. We went from relying on consultants to whom we outsource a lot of what we do before the deal to now bringing it inhouse. We setted up our own systems from the ground up which is great because we didn't inherit someone else's accounting system and someone else's land system. We didn't have to figure all that out. We took about 90 days to integrate Baywater assets. We've moved on towards optimization of the assets that we acquired. We've been doing gas lift optimization projects. We also have been doing workovers which we'll continue to do between now and the end of the year. We've got some low hanging fruit to exploit some inefficiencies in the assets and get a little bit more productivity out of them. So at the time we did the last acquisition, which was a $600 million acquisition. It was more than 10 times the size of our company. A minnow swallowing a whale kind of a deal, it's tough to finance that. We got a great bank syndicate together led by Citibank to fund most of the deal. Our preferred shareholders come in for $150 million to finance the rest of that deal. We have the ability to redeem this financing. We're now significantly larger than at the time we did that acquisition. Not only as a result of having done the acquisition, but also because we're growing substantially through the drill bit. And as a result, we have access to lower cost of capital. We're working tirelessly to eliminate the overhang of the preferred stock. I would point investors to the fact that very little of the preferred investment has actually converted into shares. -------- The oil and gas industry is the least expensive industry on the SP500, yet generates the greatest amount of cashflow as a percentage of business than any industry on the SP500. There is no energy transition, only an energy addition. I think we're a mispriced industry. There's just not an unlimited inventory of cheap oil. We don't need a huge reinvestment in the energy sector to see a huge re-rate in oil and gas prices. All we need is a little bit of capital flowing back into this sector to see these prices jump 10%, 20%, 30% in short order. We think there's a fundamental scarcity value to the commodity. We're running out of inventory. And that's why we're trying to get our hands on every great location we can. From the beginning, our plan has been to consolidate the DJ Basin and to build a high-growth company, through acquisitions and through the drill bit. We've done eight acquisitions in just the last two years. But we're now beginning to grow significantly through the drill bit. We really just started that program in April and May of 2025 after our last acquisition, which is our largest acquisition. And so we're really hitting exit velocity going in the back half of this year into next year where we see a future where our cash flows start to surpass our capex. And we're all about returning capital to shareholders. We ourselves are large investors in the company. We love dividend income. So that's our focus. We are under-levered compared to a lot of peers. We have no intention to become over-levered. Our vision is to continue consolidating, but also to top off and return cash flow. The stock is trading very low with the market assuming full conversion of $129 million of the preferred shares. But we're not afraid that that's going to happen because of our ability to buy out the preferred shares. And the financial markets are suppressing the price of oil. We've got a really historic level of shorts in the market. But none of the facts on the ground really reflect it. There's fear of this OPEC glut. If there was going to be a glut of oil from OPEC, you would have already seen it in the storage numbers and you're not seeing them. So I think there's a lag in terms of the market catching up with reality. We're experiencing that lag right now. And make no mistake, based on historic movements, this commodity can shoot up $20 or $30 over a very short period of time. We're putting our money where our mouth is. Every window of opportunity we have, we're all buying stock, even though we own a lot of it to date. Not every executive on the team is required to file a purchase. We remain excited about the M&A environment. We're at a great financial position. We're really well hedged. We've got nothing but good things to look forward to as a company.",12,13,2025-10-09 14:19:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2775s/prop_a_turnaround_oil_and_gas_stock_in_the_making/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.919891,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'shorts', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'acquisition']",0.84,Communication Services
T,1omta7u,ValueInvesting,DD On the 10x Potential of Misunderstood Stock $RYM,"DD on RYTHM, Inc. ($RYM) Royalty Safety Net with Beverage 10x Growth Potential Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Always DYOR. TDLR: RYM can 2-3x by 2030 just from royalties that are contractual and guaranteed as long as GTBIF revenue holds. THC Beverage business is rocket fuel that could 10x+ share price by 2030 if successful. Low Risk, High Reward Overview of RYM RYM (formerly Agrify, rebranded Sept 2025) is a non-plant-touching IP licensing company earning royalties from GTBIF on major cannabis brands (e.g., RYTHM \\\~50-58% of GTBIF sales). It also sells federally compliant hemp-derived Delta-9 THC beverages (Señorita), outsourced for asset-light operations (high margins, no CAPEX-heavy production). With \\\~$91M market cap today at $45/share (pre-dilution adjusted), upside comes from stable royalties + beverage growth. Fully diluted, current price implies \\\~724m market cap projections show massive potential if properly executed. I need to start to with explaining on what RYM is and what is going on here. GTBIF is one the major players in the MSO cannabis industry. GTBIF has out preformed its peers at every step for a while now. Its the only large Cannabis company turning a profit for years now, all of the other cannabis company’s have been unable to make a profit due to over expansion, too much debt, and 280e tax. The difference is the leadership, CEO Ben Kolver is the real difference. Playing to current market conditions not just growing at all costs and hoping reform saves you before you run out of cash. Need to get on to RYM, but Ben Kolver is the best in the game, it’s the only place I would park my money in this industry. Look at GTBIF earnings reports compared to peers, you would think we were in entirely different sectors. I trust Ben. GTBIF partners with AGFY in November 2024. They have full ownership just not technically, and put CEO Ben Kolver in charge of AGFY too. November 2024: AGFY acquires THC Beverage brand Senorita. August 2025: GTBIF sells its brands IP to AGFY, AGFY gives a license back to GTBIF to continue to produce and distribute the brands for a royalty fee. September 2025: Rebrands to Rythm INC, and changes stock ticker to RYM. (keep in mind if you are looking at stock history of RYM ignore the chart, anything before November 2024 was AGFY and that company is completely gone and has nothing to do with the new spin off. Keep in mind the majority of this stuff just happened recently we have no earnings report or update since the change, and management offers no guidance other then the CEO loading up on RYM stock in September. RYM's financials are outdated and wont reflect how fast this thing is about to change until we get new earning reports.) November 1\^(st) 2025: This is the first day royalty payments start. (expect this to be reflected in Q4 ER) Share Structure and Dilution Details This is what most people are afraid of with this stock is the dilution. So for this entire DD I will always be assuming the stock is Fully Diluted. To understand dilution, RYM's structure is key—current outstanding common shares are 2,002,568 (as of Oct 8, 2025), with a public float of 1.18 million (\\\~59%). Insider ownership \\\~44% (GTBIF \\\~35% via subsidiaries), institutions \\\~6%. However, potential dilution from securities could increase shares to 15,864,391 fully diluted (our assumption for all projections): \* Warrants: 7,641,866 issuable (including 7,601,788 pre-funded at $0.0001/share; others at \\\~$7.30 weighted average exercise price; anti-dilution adjustments possible). \* Convertible Notes: 6,137,882 shares underlying \\\~$85-100M notes (issued to GTBIF affiliates; conversion prices $3.158-$29.475; 10% interest; maturities Nov 2025-Feb 2027; optional conversion, partial allowed; 49.99% ownership cap for GTBIF on later notes). \* Stock Options: 75 issuable (vested, \\\~$18,000+ weighted exercise price, post-split adjusted). \* Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): 82,000 issuable upon vesting. \* Other: $100M shelf for future securities (limited to \\\~$20M equity without approval due to low float); equity line with Ionic Ventures (\\\~$15M remaining). Why did GTBIF do this setup? They wanted a NasDaq company, access to more capital, credibility, huge tax advantages, and the ability to do M&A with legitimate company’s. The Dilution setup is not some evil plan to screw everyone, infact it’s the opposite. The dilution is upfront, you know it's they're just account for it. That is much more transparent than other companies that dilute you constantly with new fillings. (Think Tilray for example). Alot of GTBIF’s dilution is capped at them not being able to own more then 49.99% of the company. They currently own 35%, with 700k shares and there is potential for another \\\~14m Shares. So they will dilute gradually and then they have to do something with the shares. That’s where the M&A comes in. CEO Ben Kolver is a firm believer in smart money allocation; he has publicly he doesn’t spend a dollar unless he says an opportunity to get at least a 20% ROI. So the dilution will be gradual and used to create more value, interests are aligned with these companies. But regardless we will treat the stock as if its fully diluted right now today for a 724m Market Cap. One thing to watch if you are unsure is a 10m note is maturing Nov 5, 2025, could add 3.17M shares if fully converted, that would GTBIF well over 50% ownership. They could covert partial and let RYM pay back the rest in cash. With the Convertibles notes if they ever let RYM pay them back instead of Convert shares they are adding instant value to share holders. I haven’t ran numbers on that because again everything here is assuming worst case Fully Diluted, but only 3 days away we have a big note maturing and if RYM even had the opportunity to back half it makes a massive upside that I am not accounting for. Watch how GTBIF/RYM handle the dilution on November 5\^(th) if it's a concern for you. Ramping Royalties Layout Let's start getting into the numbers, the royalty are a safety net that could lead to 100% gains on their own even if the beverage business fails. Royalties ramp per the Aug 27, 2025 licensing agreement: Monthly fees on branded Net Revenue (wholesale/transfer prices), escalating by year and category. Core brands (RYTHM, Beboe, etc.) ramp faster; others (&SHINE, etc.) slower. Blended assumes core dominate (\\\~90% of branded). Nov 1, 2025 - Dec 31, 2026 6% Royalty Jan 1- Dec 31 2027 9% royalty core brands, 6% royalty other brands Jan 1-Dec 31 2028 12% Core Brands and 8% Other Brands Jan 1- Dec 31 2029 15% Core brands and 10% Other Brands Jan 1 2030+ 18% Core Brands and 12% Other brands I am assuming royalties the just started November 1\^(st) 2025, and won’t be reflected till Q4 earnings. So have no hard data, but have Investor Relations telling us currently it's about 58% of Total Revenue, and it matches what the have said in the past about their brand sales. Royalties provide a strong floor, as they're tied to GTBIF's branded sales (58% share, wholesale basis) with escalating rates. Projections assume GTBIF revenue starts at $1.15B LTM, no further dilution beyond full today. One of the reason’s RYM has some much more potential is it’s another entirely different company, in a completely different industry. This is Brand Co. RYM is an asset-light brand licensing company (royalties from GTBIF on cannabis brands) with growing federally compliant hemp THC beverage revenue (e.g., Señorita, no production/distribution—outsourced for high margins \\\~50-70%). This positions it outside traditional cannabis valuations (1-3x P/S due to federal risks and 280E taxes) and more like consumer licensing/beverage plays. Will be using 3 different metrics to value the company compared to industry avergae. \* P/S at 10x: Blended for licensing (8x) + high-growth beverages (12x); conservative for asset-light model. \* EV/EBITDA at 20x: Assumes 60% EBITDA margins (high for no production; royalties near 100% margin, beverages 50% after outsourcing); typical for licensing/hemp growth. \* EV/Revenue at 12x: Focuses on top-line for early-stage beverage scaling; per industry data for non-touching consumer IP. Safety Net: Royalty Income on Its Own (Excluding Beverages) Moderate Growth Scenario (5% annual GTBIF growth; conservative, state expansions only): \* 2025 (prorated Nov-Dec): $6.7M royalties → P/S Val $67M ($4.22/share); EV/Rev Val $80.4M ($5.07/share); EV/EBITDA Val $80.4M ($5.07/share) \* 2026: $42M → P/S $420M ($26.47/share); EV/Rev $504M ($31.77/share); EV/EBITDA $504M ($31.77/share) \* 2027: $58.9M → P/S $589M ($37.12/share); EV/Rev $706.8M ($44.54/share); EV/EBITDA $706.8M ($44.54/share) \* 2028: $84.9M → P/S $849M ($53.52/share); EV/Rev $1,018.8M ($64.22/share); EV/EBITDA $1,018.8M ($64.22/share) \* 2029: $113.5M → P/S $1,135M ($71.54/share); EV/Rev $1,362M ($85.85/share); EV/EBITDA $1,362M ($85.85/share) \* 2030: $144.7M → P/S $1,447M ($91.22/share); EV/Rev $1,736.4M ($109.46/share); EV/EBITDA $1,736.4M ($109.46/share) Rescheduling Bull Case (5% growth 2026, 15% from 2027; tax relief, market boom): \* 2025: $6.7M → Same as above ($4.22-$5.07/share) \* 2026: $42M → Same ($26.47-$31.77/share) \* 2027: $64.5M → P/S $645M ($40.66/share); EV/Rev $774M ($48.79/share); EV/EBITDA $774M ($48.79/share) \* 2028: $101.9M → P/S $1,019M ($64.23/share); EV/Rev $1,222.8M ($77.07/share); EV/EBITDA $1,222.8M ($77.07/share) \* 2029: $149.2M → P/S $1,492M ($94.05/share); EV/Rev $1,790.4M ($112.86/share); EV/EBITDA $1,790.4M ($112.86/share) \* 2030: $208.4M → P/S $2,084M ($131.36/share); EV/Rev $2,500.8M ($157.63/share); EV/EBITDA $2,500.8M ($157.63/share) Royalties alone provide a safety net: Even in moderate growth, they ramp to $145M by 2030, valuing RYM at $91-109/share across metrics. With Rescheduling and the Bull case looking at $131-157 a share fully diluted. So massive potential even fully diluted and no rescheduling and the beverage business flopping worst case scenario. Federally Compliant THC Beverage Market Foundation The US hemp-derived Delta-9 THC market (federally legal via 2018 Farm Bill if <0.3% Delta-9 by dry weight) is booming, especially beverages, as a workaround to cannabis Schedule I restrictions. Recent data (2024-2025): The hemp-derived THC beverage market in the US is currently a rapidly expanding segment within the broader cannabis drinks industry, valued at approximately $382 million in 2024 and projected to approach $600 million in 2025, driven by federal compliance under the 2018 Farm Bill and increasing consumer preference for low-calorie, non-alcoholic alternatives to traditional drinks. Expected growth through 2030 is strong, with the overall US cannabis beverages market (including hemp-derived) anticipated to reach $3.1 billion to $3.86 billion at a CAGR of 16.3% to 19.2%, fueled by legalization trends, rescheduling potential, and mainstream retail adoption; the hemp-specific subset could hit $1.23 billion by 2028 and $2-4 billion by 2030 in conservative estimates, or up to $10-15 billion in bull scenarios with accelerated expansion post-rescheduling. RYM is a first mover in the Hemp Derived THC space, has more capital than any of its competitors by a long shot and the backing of GTBIF. They secured the first big deals we have seen in the space, they are part of the Circle K 900 stores expansion, they are part of the Target trial phase rollout. The product is great (Senorita, I have personally tried it lol). They have started the advertising campaign, Billboards in major city's, the Salt Shed Venue in Chicago, collaborations with celebrities (most recently MeganMakesMoney form BarStoolsSports). One other thing that's worth Mentioning I can’t give enough praise to CEO Ben Kovler but another thing about him is he is the Heir to the Jim Bean alcohol company. It’s literally in his blood to market and sell feel good beverages during a prohibition period. He has the whit's, experience and connections. I can’t stress how important good management is and CEO Ben Kolver is the founder, and he wants this more than anyone. No Data on Senorita Sales yet, I’m going to use a 10% of Total Market Share for Hemp Derived THC which I think very realistic. This is about branding and getting in retail stores, there will only be a few big players when the market matures. Think of beers at the gas stations, energy drinks like monster/ rockstar. I think Ben said he thought he could get 20-30% of the market, but just running numbers on the safe side. Combined Revenues: Royalty + Beverages (10% Market Share, 25% as Revenue accounting for outsourcing cost + wholesale price to retail) Adjusted hemp THC beverage market starting at $1B in 2025 (per Reuters/Market Watch bull estimates).

The Beverage business is the rocket the has the potential to 10x+ your shares very fast if management can pull it off. The possibilities are endless with the setup, GTBIF can dilute buy more brands, sell them to RYM and RYM license them back for royalty fee. By the way this is a DD on RYM but this is great for GTBIF, first they handle all the production and distribution for RYM, so this is growing their business too. GTBIF ownership in RYM should be reflected on its balance sheet. It’s current not, we have a 700m Market Cap company RYM that GTBIF owns virtually 90% off, and GTBIF price not reflecting that yet. November 5\^(th) earnings report should bring some awareness to this situation because GTBIF is incredibly undervalued as well. RYM has potential to be worth more than GTBIF in very short time. GTBIF making 1.1B a year in revenue is valued at roughly 1.8B market cap right now. RYM making 1B in revenue would be valued at round 10-12B market cap. RYM is the FREE call option for the pure cannabis play. My Positions: 275k in GTBIF 225k in RYM I think the best play is to own both. GTI is your safety and core and as RYM goes up in value that's added to GTI anyways because they own all the shares. RYM is the one with the realistic 10x+ potential, a little riskier but the royalty alone should be safety. Of course if you have been paying attention you should know the Hemp Derived THC has become a hot topic and may get banned or regulated. Word on the street is that low dose THC beverages are most likely safe, Gas station weed and vapes are bigger targets. Though it is a risk but again RYM can stand on its own 2 feet just as Brand CO. So with a 720m market cap is RYM overpriced? It feels expensive, no denying that. But keep in mind these Royalties are locked in. Q4 earnings this year should show 10m in royalties and next year it should be 40-50m in royalties. The royalties scale up 300% by 2030 ramping over the years. We are priced to have over 100% gain on royalty alone no S3 needed. With S3 the royalty income alone should 3x the stock. The beverage game is different. It can scale very quickly. It’s mostly about advertising and getting stores to put you on their shelf, they already have the cash and distributor. So while right now today 725m seems expensive, that can change very quickly. Personally I’m invested at these prices, maybe it drops after ER or maybe it sky rockets. Play it however you want I’m in for the long run Another Bullish Possibility, like 6 million of the share Dilution is from the Convertible Notes GTBIF holds, those are from loans GTBIF gave to RYM. If RYM is allowed to pay back even just some of the loan and not dilute these numbers get so much better. This whole DD is based on the fully diluted share count, but there is a chance RYM could pay back some of the loans which would just sweeten the deal even more. If you like the GTBIF and trust Management can execute with operational excellence just as they been, It’s a stock to watch.",10,2,2025-11-02 21:21:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1omta7u/dd_on_the_10x_potential_of_misunderstood_stock_rym/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.864254,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.6,['RYM'],"['bull', 'earnings', 'rocket', 'rally', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'split']",0.7457142857142857,Communication Services
T,1ofzn7u,stocks,Margin Loans when short selling,"So before I start this post I’d like to clarify some terms: Assets (A) = total value of all the securities (stocks, bonds etc.) you hold and cash Short Sale Proceeds (SP) = cash you make initially when you enter a short sell position by selling the stocks you borrowed Market Value of the Short Position (MVSP) = current market value of the short sell position (current market stock price x amount of stocks) Equity is the following: Equity (E) = (A + SP) - MVSP Initial Margin requires that E >= 50% (Yes, it’s 150% but my formula for Equity already includes the proceeds from the short sale position which covers 100% of the 150% requirement leaving me to cover 50%) Maintenance Margin requires that E >= 25% In other words, it is required that I hold 25% of the market value of the short position in equity. A good way to see this is that the value of my assets plus short sell proceeds (A + SP) have to be a minimum of 125% of the market value of the short position A + SP >= 1.25 * MVSP Here is my question: when exactly am I borrowing from my broker? From what I’ve seen online, there are two ways to accrue interest from a short sell position: - The Cost to Borrow, interest paid to the person lending me the stocks - Margin loan interest paid to my broker I’m confused about the second, when is my broker ever lending me anything in this entire process? My ASSETS and Short sell Proceeds (A + SP) have to always cover a 25% increase in the market value of the short position minimum (A + SP >= MVSP + 25% MVSP) otherwise I get margin called. In other words, it’s impossible for me be in a situation where I have to borrow money from my broker to cover the value of the short sell position because I’d be margin called before that! Remember, maintenance margin requires me to keep 25% increase assets to cover for potential forward upwards mouvemrnt in the stock price! So is it the case that I only borrow cash from my broker and owe them interest in the event that I get margin called and I don’t have enough in Assets + SP to cover the MVSP so they have to use their own cash to close the position (meaning buy back the stock at current market price and give them back to the lender)?",4,11,2025-10-25 19:00:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofzn7u/margin_loans_when_short_selling/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.821575,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.9,[],[],0.7,Communication Services
T,1o8aogz,ValueInvesting,Universal Insurance Holdings ($UVE) - A quiet insurance stock that might be seriously undervalued right now,"I’ve been digging into Universal Insurance Holdings ($UVE) lately, and I think it’s one of those low-float, under-the-radar names that could be setting up for a sneaky run to end 2025. $UVE is a Florida-based property & casualty insurer, mostly homeowners' insurance. Small cap (\~$807M), trades around $28.50/share, pays a slight above a 2% dividend. It usually sits in the “boring but stable” category. **Here’s why I think it’s actually a pretty compelling value right now:** # 1. The market is missing how good this hurricane season has been We’re basically at the tail end of hurricane season, and the latest GFS models are showing *virtually zero* risk of a major storm hitting the U.S. through the end of October. That’s rare, and if it holds, it’ll be the first year with no U.S. landfalls in quite a while. For an insurer like UVE, that’s massive. Fewer hurricanes = fewer claims = better underwriting margins. Most of their reinsurance coverage never gets touched, so more premiums drop straight to earnings. Historically, a “clean” hurricane season translates to a 20-30% jump in book value and EPS the following year. The kicker is that markets are usually slow to react until the next earnings release confirms it. # 2. Cheap valuation with room to re-rate At \~$28.5, UVE’s: * P/E \~12x * P/B \~1.7x * ROE \~15% * Dividend yield \~2.25 If they post strong Q4 results (which seems likely), that P/E could compress to \~10x on forward earnings. Give it even a modest re-rating to 15x (which peers like HCI and RNR trade at in stable years), and you’re looking at a fair value closer to $35–$38/share, plus the dividend. Not bad for a company that’s essentially printing underwriting profits right now. # 3. Despite recent momentum, the price hasn’t really moved Even though there’s been a small upward trend lately, UVE is still trading right around the same price it was back in early June when hurricane season started. That means the market is valuing the company *exactly the same* now as it did when there was a real risk of a major landfall event. Fast forward to mid-October, and we’ve almost cleared the season with no significant U.S. hurricanes and the price hasn’t meaningfully rerated. That disconnect feels like a clear case of sentiment lagging fundamentals. # 4. Behavioral lag = opportunity Insurance stocks are always laggards after a quiet season because investors don’t trust it’ll stay quiet. Everyone assumes the next hurricane is just around the corner. That creates a classic underreaction setup where fundamentals improve faster than sentiment. Combine that with low analyst coverage, thin volume, and general “who cares” vibes toward insurers in a bull market, and you’ve got the recipe for mispricing. # 4. Florida risk isn’t what it used to be Florida’s insurance market used to be a mess (litigation, fraud, rate caps). But the reforms from 2023-24 actually made a difference. Fewer frivolous claims, faster approvals for rate hikes, and more stability overall. It’s not perfect, but it’s *way* better than two years ago, and UVE’s balance sheet reflects that. # 5. Simple risk/reward * **Upside:** 20–30% if earnings and valuation both improve * **Downside:** Limited near-term risk unless something truly freakish happens weather-wise * **Catalyst:** Q4 / FY earnings early 2025, confirming a strong combined ratio and better reinsurance pricing for next year So in my view, this is a smart asymmetric bet. You’re buying an insurer at book value, right as catastrophic risk fades and profitability jumps. I’m not saying it’s a moonshot, but it’s the kind of setup value investors usually only notice *after* the move. Sometimes the boring, weather-dependent names quietly outperform everything else. **Not financial advice, just sharing the thesis.**",4,2,2025-10-16 16:22:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o8aogz/universal_insurance_holdings_uve_a_quiet/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.118273,0.8999999999999999,$T,0.6,['UVE'],"['bull', 'earnings', 'dividend', 'moon', 'volume', 'profit', 'eps']",0.64,Communication Services
T,1op4yft,stocks,My Best Advice To New Investors: Know What Kind of Investor You Are,"Hey all, this one is for all the newbies out there. I’m afraid some new investors who have been attracted to markets given the wild bull run are going to get hurt (as we often see toward the end of a cycle). So I’m hoping to pass on some fundamental knowledge that might save some people some serious pain. Some background on me, I was a professional options market maker when I started my career. Since that time, I’ve spent most of my career in consulting, but have a lifelong love of markets and investing. I’ve gone to some of the top finance schools in the country for undergrad and MBA and have been active in my portfolio for nearly 15 years. My #1 piece of advice is that you need to know what kind of investor you are and not get your wires crossed. Some of the biggest mistakes in markets are made when people mix time frames, trade structure, risk profiles under the illusion they’re doing something else. I’m seeing a lot of posts that are doing just that so here’s a basic lay of the land. In my mind there are really 4 types of retail equity market investors: 1. The Indexer (risk: Medium): You’ve probably seen on some threads people posting “VOO and chill”. For the vast majority of market participants, this IS the answer. It’s the answer for me as well in my retirement accounts that I don’t actively manage. Your risk is not low, you’re in stocks. You may make a lot, little, or even lose in a given year, but you should expect to make a market return (8%-10% per year) over the long haul. You subscribe to the adage “time in market is better than timing the market” and take your money and methodically buy diversified ETFs without a “view” on what is going to happen and with a relatively high degree of certainty that the long term trend of corporate earnings growth and overall market appreciation will continue. This is the only strategy where your hold time truly should be “forever” because the index is rebalancing for you as companies are added and dropped based on their market cap. You don’t need to manage it generally. If you’re this investor, my best advice is close your lap top, get off Reddit, check your portfolio once a year around Christmas and go live your life. 2. The Active Investor (Risk: Variable): This is where I fall in my brokerage account. This investor enjoys learning about stocks/markets and is actively choosing stocks/investments and may be dialing up or back risk to try to time exposure to certain market cycles. The goal here is to outperform the market or to achieve a specific goal (e.g, owning dividend stocks for income, blue chips to try to reduce portfolio volatility). You’re holding positions for months to years at a time and actively researching because you enjoy the thrill of “being right.” If you can beat the market by a few % points consistently (10%-15% on average) you’re a genius, and many investors are likely to underperform. It is doable, but it requires diligence and a willingness to sell losing positions and to let winners ride. You may use instruments like options as a way to mitigate risk or juice returns, but you’re generally not going to use a ton of leverage and you’re still of the mindset that you’re getting rich slowly over time (just hopefully a bit quicker than if you indexed). My advice to this investor is to learn everything you can about markets, companies, sentiment, valuations, macro, and invest where there are good fundamentals and potential for earnings growth. You DO NOT have the luxury to burry your head in the sand when certain picks inevitably lose money. You can’t hold bags forever, because there is a chance your holding will go to 0 or never recover. You need to make peace with being wrong sometimes, cutting, and moving on. 3. The Trader (Risk: High): This type of market participant is in and out with a very short term hold time (from seconds to days). The goal here is to try to “get rich quick” but it is incredibly difficult. You’re hoping to achieve 40%-100% returns in a year, and as a result you’re also opening yourself up to equally as large losses. The trader needs to develop a system that provides “edge” (a tell that they believe has predictive power to increase the probability of profitable trading). This again, can be done, but it’s hard, really hard. Markets are highly efficient and when you deploy significant capital and moderate amounts of leverage, often into high volatility assets or events, you’re taking substantial risk. Most traders will never make it, and the ones that do will often times have spent years “paying tuition to the markets.” My advice here is that if you’re doing this, develop a system and don’t play with money you can’t afford to lose (e.g., retirement funds). Paper trade before you try the real thing, and if it’s not working, be comfortable with the idea of walking away. If you’re seeing a get rich quick trading video on YouTube, I can pretty much guarantee you it’s not going to end well. That person is selling trading “secrets” because they can’t actually make money doing those things consistently in the market. A real trader will never reveal his/her edge, because once it’s broadly known the efficient market takes the opportunity away. You can learn/read about different techniques but ultimately you’re on your own. There is a fine line between this persona and the next. 4. The Gambler (Risk: Insane): I see a lot of these guys running around Reddit pretending they are one of the first 3 and giving/following advice accordingly. The key distinction between a gambler and a trader in my opinion, is the irresponsible use of leverage. A small to moderate amount of leverage can make sense if you have strict risk limits on your trading and you have significant experience with a proven strategy. That is VERY DIFFERENT from getting lucky on one or two low probability options trades and betting the house. When you see WSB loss and gain porn, that is these guys. You cannot make 100%+ on your capital in a short duration without also having a chance to lose the value of that investment entirely. Markets are far too efficient for everyone to get rich quick. Options can be used in a lot of ways, but when you are taking out a substantial portion of your portfolio and betting on a significant market swing, you need to be right about both timing and velocity and the probability you’re going to be able to do this consistently is low. You can think of it as being similar to consistently winning long shot parlay bets on a betting app. Could it happen? Sure. Is it likely to happen? No. Many of these trades will never recover and you will be writing a post a year from now trying to urge people not to follow in your footsteps. The Reddit app gives the illusion that these winners happen much more frequently than they actually do. If you want to take a small amount of money, open a robinhood account, and swing for the fences knowing you’re likely to lose it all, god speed, but my advice - DO NOT trade like this unless it is money you are actually willing to lose and do not trade options unless you’ve taken the time to actually understand how they gain and lose value over time. I hope this helps some people… good luck out there. There are a million ways to make and lose money in markets, but know who you are and the risk you’re taking. And most importantly, don’t believe you’re investing when you’re really gambling.",79,22,2025-11-05 14:53:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1op4yft/my_best_advice_to_new_investors_know_what_kind_of/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.793225,0.85,$T,0.9,[],"['bull', 'earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'market cap', 'profit', 'loss', 'eps']",1.0,Communication Services
T,1ob6z1h,ValueInvesting,"95 years ago in one week’s time, Wall Street crashed. Here is a rather longish article on it. ( I don’t think we are there yet but there are subtle similarities, see if you can spot them)","Source: History’s Greatest Hits by Joseph Cummins Borrowed from Internet Library 1929 The Wall Street Crash: The Stockmarket Sell-off that Sparked a Worldwide Depression (Picture: An anxious crowd gathers on Wall Street on ""Black Thursday', 24 October 1929. The final crash came on 29 October, 'Black Tuesday'.) (Picture: In 1930, a year after the Crash, an unemployed man makes a heart-rending appeal fer a job, on a street corner in Detroit.) ONE MAN POISONED HIMSELF, his wife and his two young children. Another dropped dead in his stockbroker's office. Still another, who lived in a small town in North Carolina, went into his garage and shot himself, the echo careening around his quiet neighbourhood Rich and poor alike were affected. Winston Churchill, staying at a fancy New York hotel, awoke to a commotion. ""Under my very window, he later wrote, 'a gentleman cast himself fifteen stories and was dashed to pieces? Irving Berlin, the famous songwriter, remembered it this ways “I had all the money I wanted for the rest of my life. Then all of a sudden I didn't: It was 'Black Tuesday, 29 October 1929. Earlier that morning, in the first thirty minutes of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, over three million shares of stock had changed hands, something that normally took five hours. All of the major companies - General Electric, Chrysler, Standard Oil - were plummeting. Gradually, a crowd, later estimated at about ten thousand, filled thetiny winding streets around the exchange. Though the New York police commissioner placed extra security on the streets of the financial district, the people weren't violent. Instead, they seemed to be in shock. A reporter for The New York Times described the scene as 'a sort of paralysed hypnosis: Inside the exchange, a broker, looking out a window, had the horrible feeling that he was surrounded by 'haunted things. And this was only the start. American companies, their stock prices collapsing, either went bankrupt or laid off employees, instituting sharp drops in the production of goods. As people lost their jobs, they went through their savings and often lost their homes, as well. Their purchases - of new cars, furniture, clothing - dropped, and more companies began to close. Without money from industries and personal savings (and without federal banking insurance, something that is mandatory in the United States today), banks began to fail. The crash also had an international impact, too. With American businesses failing, the U.S. government instituted high tariffs on imported goods, hoping to stimulate the economy. The effect on foreign trade was disastrous. European countries, already experiencing their own financial difficulties due to overspeculation in their markets, found that the tariffs made it impossible for them to compete in the American marketplace. In response, they instituted their own tariffs, and international trade nearly ground to a standstill. ROARING TOWARDS DISASTER In America, along with the 1960s, the so-called Roaring Twenties is the twentieth-century decade most likely to be stereotyped.There, the name conjures up Prohibition,gangsters, flappers and bizarre fads. In fact,much of the stereotyping has a basis in fact.People were fad crazy in the United States. They held competitions to see how long theycould sit atop flagpoles. They took part indance marathons. They loved the new talking movies, the Marx Brothers, grand musical extravaganzas on Broadway and sneaking down to the corner 'speakeasy' for a little snort of bonded Canadian whisky - or so the proprietor claimed - on the sly. Driving all theses fads was the greatest fad of all: playing the stock market. Prior to this era, the buying and selling of stock had been a rich man's game. But by the twenties, one million Americans (out of a population of about 120 million) owned three hundred million shares of stocks in U.S. companies. This was in large part due to the advent of radio, telephone and, especially, the ticker-tape machine - a small electronic machine from which a paper tape issued showing stock price quotations, allowing one to check each 'tick' (upwards or downwards movement) of a stock, and communicate buy and sell orders almost instantly. The practice of buying stock 'on the margin' - paying only a portion of the stock's price yourself and borrowing the rest from a stockbroker - became so widespread that it seemed that you would have to be crazy not to play the market. As in the dot-com boom of the 1990s, stories abounded of ordinary people - the minister of the local church, a great aunt, that quiet girl working behind the perfume counter at Sears - amassing fortunes. If you just stuck your money in a bank, you were, in the parlance of the day, a sucker. THE BUSINESS OF AMERICA In the mid-1920s, most Americans were quite happy with this situation - and with their government. Following the trauma of the Great War and what had been shown to be a corrupt administration under President Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge became U.S. president in 1923. 'Silent Cal' came across as a country bumpkin - a man of few but trenchant words who did not suffer city slickers gladly. Gencrally, voters approved of his 'common man' approach, feeling that it mirrored their own feelings about themselves and their country. However, Coolidge was not quite what he appeared to be. In fact, he liked nothing better than to hobnob with the heads of major corporations in America at the time - John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Andrew Mellon. 'The business of America is business, Coolidge proclaimed. And: 'The man who builds a factory builds a temple.' Despite his working-man persona, Coolidge made basic changes that favoured the wealthy over the working class - for instance, he made Mellon his Secretary of the Treasury and then allowed him to reduce income tax rates for big businesses and the rich. Under Coolidge's presidency, business boomed. New technologies and procedures, which included Henry Ford's assembly line and improved techniques for refining oil, allowed companies to produce more iron, steel, gas and chemicals. But, unfortunately, this was a business and production boom, not an employment boom, since many of the new industrial methods had as their goal the elimination of manual labour. In a familiar story, the rich got richer as the poor got poorer - in the 1920s, according to historians, ninety per cent of the nation's wealth was concentrated in the hands of thirteen per cent of the population (today, roughly seventy per cent of wealth is held by ten per cent of the population). Indeed, this so-called 'New Era' of prosperity was to a large extent a chimera - as Mellon's tax cuts took effect, corporations which were making little in the way of profits had more money to spend, and they spent it on the stock market. And anyone in America who could afford to follow suit did so. There were four million unemployed people in America by the end of 1928, yet the Twenties roared on unabated. When Coolidge refused to run for president again in 1928, his wife told a friend, *Papa says there's going to be a depression, but those who heard this just laughed, clected another pro-business leader, Herbert Hoover, and kept on speculating. RIDING THE ROLLER COASTER During the summer of 1929, the stock market reached an all-time high, with record numbers of shares being purchased. But the situation was beginning to give pause to sober observers. For not only were more and more shares being bought on the margin, but also, as of early autumn 1929, only a third of stocks - about four hundred of twelve hundred listed on the New York Stock Exchange - had grown in value since the previous January. It was also noted that the huge 'stock trusts' - groups of wealthy investors who pooled their money to purchase stocks - could drive up almost any stock they wanted, simply by investing heavily in it. In September, an influential economist named Roger Babson made a speech in which he said that a crash was coming, and that there would likely be 'a stampede for selling which will exceed anything that the Stock Exchange has ever seen? Babson had been saying this for a year or so, but few had paid any attention to him previously. Now, however, his words echoed secret fears harboured by many, and a sell-off began. The market righted itself a few days later, but throughout September and into October it plunged up and down like a roller coaster. A FEEDING FRENZY When the stock market finally crashed on Tuesday 29 October, it was one of the bleakest days in American financial history, becoming forever known as Black Tuesday. But five days prior to this, on 24 October, a near-crash had already occurred. It became known as Black Thursday. Through early October, stocks had rebounded slightly as prominent bankers made calming statements to the effect that the market was simply adjusting itself. But late on the afternoon of Wednesday 23 October there was a sharp and terrifying plunge in the Dow Jones average (an index of select industrial stocks whose status is seen as an indicator of the health of the market in general) as brokers were flooded with sell orders by those who, like Babson, had finally decided the market was going to crash. In those days, unless they were wealthy enough to afford their own ticker tape machine, people congregated in brokers' offices all over the country to watch the progress of their stocks. Stock panics, even in today's era of personal computers, are highly contagious. Think how much more virulent they would have been when your fellow investors were sitting right next to you, sweating and yelling 'sell' orders. By the end of trading on Wednesday, six million shares had changed hands, with losses of US $4 billion dollars. That evening, stockbrokers began to make margin calls to those customers who had borrowed money to buy their stocks. In other words, the stockbrokers forced their clients to instantly repay the money they had borrowed to purchase the stock - the equivalent of a bank with whom you have a home mortgage suddenly contacting you to say that you need to pay off your entire mortgage at once or the bank will sell your house. Shortly after the market opened on Thursday, it sped downwards like a space rocket plummeting back to earth. Panicked crowds in Wall Street and around the country pushed their brokers to seil and speculators dumped stock quickly. When those who had been called for cash to meet their margins were unable to come up with it, the brokers sold the stocks quickly, to recover whatever part of their losses they could. It was a horrible feeding frenzy, made worse by the fact that the overwhelmed ticker tape system broke down and most stock quotations were forty-five minutes late. Since stocks were dropping twenty points in that interval, speculators and brokers were left in the dark about real values and began to sell blindly. By mid-afternoon, stocks had crashed to the tune of US$11.25 billion. The only thing that saved the market for another ""black' day was the fact that a consortium of bankers quickly pooled together about US$250 million and sent one of their members to walk the floor of the New York Stock Exchange making loud 'buy' orders, often at above the asking price. By the end of the day, the market had stabilised, but was still down to the tune of USS3 billion dollars, THE BLACKEST DAY Between this penultimate day of tragedy for Wall Street and Black Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board, prominent bankers and President Herbert Hoover worked feverishly to restore public confidence. The fundamental business of this country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis, Hoover said. (It was the kind of irrationally optimistic comment the nation would come to expect from this president. Later, when bankrupted doctors and businessmen were forced to sell apples on the street to make ends meet, he told a reporter: 'Many people have left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples.) But many people had been wiped out on Black Thursday, and those who hadn't began to wonder if they hadn't better sell in order to hang on to whatever savings they had left. Consequently, on Monday, 28 October, despite the reassurances, there was another plunge and near-crash. And on Tuesday, 29 October, the devastation really began. The day started with thousands of people congregating in Wall Street, as if they nceded to be present at what they sensed was going to be a historic moment. All of the major stocks - those linchpins upon which the market depended - began to crash before the horrified eyes of those on the floor of the stock exchange. ATXT lost 105 points in a few hours that morning. RCA plummeted from 110 to 26. Brokers received sell orders from their clients, and went into a frenzy trying to place them. In two hours, eight million shares of stock were sold. Onc broker, apparently driven to a nervous breakdown by the pace of the activity, began screaming and rushed from the exchange, knocking over anyone who got in his way. In the meantime, further margin calls ruined almost everyone who had borrowed to buy stocks. As the day wore on, people began to fall into shock. A reporter for The New York Times perceptively wrote that 'to most of those who have been in the market it is all the more awe inspiring because their financial history is limited to bull markets. In other words, these ordinary investors had never faced the full, clawing fury of a Wall Street bear market. At three o'clock, after five hours of trading, the market closed. Sixteen million shares had been traded. The nation had suffered an estimated USS15 billion dollars in losses. The Dow Jones had tumbled from 290 to 260 points, furthering its slide of 120 points since September. The stories of suicides began - as the humourist Will Rogers was to write sardonically, you had to stand in line to get a window to jump out of. While these tales are as exaggerated as some of the earlier boom tales of clerks gaining instant riches from stocks, there were some who took their own lives as a result of their financial ruin. Businesses began to die as well. The first to go were the investment firms, followed by companies that had overspeculated in stocks, and banks. Like a house of cards, the Roaring Twenties tumbled to an end. RISKS REMAIN Herbert Hoover had entered office in the greatest bull market of all time. By the time he left it, overwhelmingly beaten by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, he was surrounded by mobs chanting We want bread!' These days, historians do not place the blame for the Great Depression only on the 1929 Crash, but also on the Hoover Administration. Its economic policies, including high tariffs that stifled international trade and not issuing enough money, created a shortage of cash and did little to help stimulate the economy. There would be other stock market crashes, one in October 1987, another at the end of the dot-com boom after 2000. but these did not have nearly so catastrophic an effect on the world. Among the lessons learned after the 1929 Crash was that margin lending had to be controlled, that the government needed to provide insurance to banks - the glorious 'free market' needed in some sense to be regulated. Today, stocks, although they provide the highest return on the investment dollar, are still risky; and most ordinary investors cast concerned eyes upon their investment funds and pensions on a regular basis. The stories from 1929 of bodies thudding to the pavement - even if not all are true - remain a salutary warning. ——- A FAVOURITE WAY OUT Did as many people commit suicide after the 1929 crash as is often rumoured? Almost certainly not. John Kenneth Galbraith, in his book The Great Crash, studied U.S. death statistics and found that the number of suicides actually went down during the period from 1929 to 1932. And although some people did kill themselves, jumping out of windows was by no means the favourite way to go, dramatic as that was. According to William Klingaman, in his book 1929: The Year of the Great Crash, gas was the preferred means of shuffling off this mortal coil, followed by a gunshot wound straight to the heart. —- (Pictures are on my Reddit page)",38,13,2025-10-20 01:24:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ob6z1h/95_years_ago_in_one_weeks_time_wall_street/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.103545,0.85,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'calls', 'rocket', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss']",0.94,Communication Services
T,1ol3n8d,wallstreetbets,Why PayPal $PYPL Could Explode with ChatGPT Users,"We all know PayPal. It’s been around forever as the go to online checkout, though now there are other options like Apple Pay, Zelle and more. PayPal also owns Venmo. Growth hasn’t been huge. Year over year user growth is only around 1 percent, so it’s not exactly the hottest stock in the market. But, I think that will re-accelerate. But last week, PayPal announced a partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a billion active users who will now be able to easily buy and sell through ChatGPT using PayPal. Even better, eligible transactions come with PayPal’s Purchase Protection and Seller Protection. This means users get the convenience of PayPal’s wallet in Instant Checkout, with multiple funding options like bank, balance, or card, plus tracking, dispute resolution, and all the protections PayPal buyers and sellers value. PayPal will also connect its global merchant network to OpenAI, creating a platform for tens of millions of small businesses as well as the largest brands in the world to sell within ChatGPT. I think this has the potential to add a ton of new active users for PayPal, growth that the market isn’t currently pricing in. Right now, PayPal trades at a PE of 13.25, which is really cheap. Forward PE is 11.9. They are also putting all of their free cash flow into buying back shares, rewarding shareholders consistently. On average, they increase the supply by just 10 percent per year, so shareholders see real value. The CEO is young and forward thinking. He even consults his kids, who are in college, on trends in AI and how to push Venmo and other innovations. I think PayPal is well-positioned to be one of the winners as AI becomes a bigger part of commerce.

I chose to pause on $hood after noticing it has maintained strong upward momentum, gaining over 262% year-to-date, and being supported by analyst optimism and solid financial performance. It’s November 5, 2025 earnings report, forecasts suggesting a 188% year-over-year growth, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Analysts raising targets and Citizen JMP to $170 and Needham to $145 which is signaling confidence in continued expansion, especially with Robinhood’s deeper push into crypto and product diversification. After i moved to the Key metrics showing a P/B ratio of 10.24x (up from 4.63x in Q1) and a P/E ratio of 46.21x, reflecting stronger investor expectations. Profitability remains high, with a net margin of 50.13% in FY 2025 Q2. I also found a lot on the insider side, CTO Jeffrey Tsvi Pinner sold 5,864 shares worth $865,118.20 on October 6, 2025, across eight transactions. The largest sale, 2,786 shares for $410,523.23, was over 2x his usual size and value, while the remaining trades stayed within normal ranges. Overall, despite short-term trading dips, i believe sentiment around Robinhood remains strong especially after so many crypto traders who haven’t traded any stock on bitget before knew they can have almost $100 future voucher for trading there, it’s driven by expanding product lines and high institutional confidence. I’m starting to believe that despite short-term trading dips, sentiment around Robinhood remains steady.

T,1o448dp,ValueInvesting,Paper money and stocks have no real value nowadays,"Trump can literally tweet and crash the entire market. But that is not even the worst part. People noticed that about 30 minutes before Trump’s tweet, someone shorted Bitcoin and made 88 million dollars. Are we entering times when money and stocks have literally no value? It has always seemed to me that when I invest in a stock, I am supposedly buying part of a company. But suddenly, if everything stops working and the world is burning, it has literally no value. I think Trump is manipulating the stock market and turning investing into a casino, something that does not make sense and is not based on real value, because his tweets can crash the market. I guess we are entering times when the value of the dollar and paper money will decrease. They can regulate the dollar’s value by printing more money or cutting interest rates. It is the same with stocks. Influential people, those around big companies and politics, are doing insider trading and you cannot stop them. When I buy any stock for 10 000 dollars, I do not feel like I am buying something valuable or safe. I feel like I am giving away my money with the fear that I might not get it back for nothing. Honestly, if I buy Nvidia stock for 10 000 dollars, am I really part of that company? Do they treat me with respect? No. I am just giving them money, hoping to grab a small piece of the cake and sell the stock for a gain, money I can later exchange for real assets like food or a home. These stocks are useless. They are basically a scam, but it works, so we all play the game. I think the stock market is evil. It is a way to multiply money easily, as if money is poured into a void. If the stock market did not exist, people would invest their money into creating businesses, building houses, manufacturing, and production that actually create tangible returns, real value, not something made from thin air. You may agree or not, but it is the truth. I hate that I also play this game, because it gives me money, yet there is so little real value in it. As I said, I buy top company stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. And what does that mean? Nothing. I do not own anything. I am just a small player that does not matter to those companies, a mouse trying to grab a crumb and run away. If the whole market tanked and I was left with those stocks, they would be useless, as useless as paper money that can be easily manipulated. Bitcoin was supposed to be the asset resistant to financial manipulation. But it is a meme asset, one tweet from Musk can move it. I think Trump hates the stock market and manipulates it with his tweets to push people into investing in real value, manufacturing, new businesses, infrastructure, food, and housing. I think that might be the future. Paper money will devalue, stocks will become worthless paper, and real value will lie in tangible assets homes, skills, art, people, food, and manufacturing. I think Trump is tanking the stock market because it is his way of bringing manufacturing back to America to be able to compete with China. Rich billionaires pour their money into stocks and create no real value. They just multiply money without effort or producing anything of real worth. The stock market has a huge influence on the small amount of manufacturing left in America. If I did not have money in the stock market, I would be happy to see that flawed system crash to the bottom. Buying stocks is not true investing. You do not produce any value. I'm poor, but I give away my money to financially support billion dollar companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and others. This is so ridiculous. I think if the dollar devalued or if the stock market tanked, it could actually be positive for society. People forget that stocks and money are just useless paper that don’t improve your life. Real value lies in tangible assets: homes, properties, medications, people, connections, metals, gold, copper, coal, wood, water, and so on. If no money existed, we would all hoard in other words, invest in water, toilet paper, wood, trees, coal, petrol, milk, fruits, food, homes, and other tangible resources. And that is how it should be. It would reduce poverty if everyone focused on producing tangible assets instead of paper stocks. There are enough resources for everyone to have a house and food. But evil people invented the stock market and paper money and made us believe it had real value, blocking access to the resources we need to survive. If everyone had houses and food, no one would work for companies nine to five their whole life until retirement. That's why they need the stock market. It's basically a black hole to throw your extra money into a void that doesn’t produce any value, keeping the poor poor and making them constantly work for rich. A stock market crash and dollar devaluation could actually be good for society because it would shift focus toward producing real value. That's why, if we want to fight billionaires and work toward being truly rich( having a home, food, and not working our whole lives as slaves )we have to ditch paper money. Billionaires control us with it. Working people should not touch money billionaires touch and have separate currency. Instead, we should pay with real value, skill for skill. I stand for a system where you do something for me, I do something for you, in exchange like it worked naturally in ancient times. Toilet paper has more real value than the stocks I hold. In a monetary system crisis, I would hoard toilet paper because it is more valuable than 100 virtual shares of some company, they may generate profit or not, but my ultimate goal is to sell those stocks, exchange them for money, and buy assets like toilet paper that improve my life.",0,62,2025-10-11 19:18:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o448dp/paper_money_and_stocks_have_no_real_value_nowadays/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.900289,0.85,$T,0.6,[],"['rally', 'support', 'profit', 'insider trading']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services

They just posted another solid quarter- EPS around $3.08 vs. $2.75 a year ago, revenue up a bit, and margins continuing to improve (operating ratio ~58.5%). It looks like they’re quietly tightening things up operationally while maintaining strong profitability. I’ve been digging into it and wondering if this could be a decent value play at current levels. The stock isn’t dirt cheap, but given the steady earnings growth, dividend consistency, and how capital-intensive the rail business is, it seems like there might be some room for long-term upside if the broader economy holds up. Interesting side note- Congressman Scott Franklin recently disclosed a buy in UNP (small, but still notable). Obviously not a reason to invest by itself, but it caught my attention since it lined up right after the earnings release. Curious what everyone else thinks: Do you see UNP as undervalued here, or more fairly priced given its growth outlook?

Early buyers jumped in after whispers of strong iPhone 17 preorders. * 10:38 AM - Investingcom confirms Apple hits a new all-time high at $260.20.

Analysts note that the buying looks disciplined — based on earnings and product data, not just momentum. * 2:16 PM - The Wall Street Journal confirms another intraday record tied directly to stronger iPhone 17 launch numbers. * 3:10 PM - Seeking Alpha reports Apple approaching $4 trillion, calling it a renewed vote of confidence in the company’s product cycle. * 3:40 PM - A live YouTube finance stream calls it Apple’s “first breakout of 2025,” linking the rally to both iPhone sales and excitement around Apple’s quiet AI ambitions. * 4:10 PM - Forbes announces Apple has overtaken Microsoft as the world’s second-most-valuable company. * 4:11 PM - Fast Company says the stock’s new high is “driven by a landmark product,” reinforcing how Apple’s innovation engine still dictates market tone. * 5:02 PM - Investopedia notes Apple’s record close and strong start to the iPhone 17 cycle. * 5:50 PM - Investor’s Business Daily highlights how Apple’s surge helped lift the entire market toward record levels. * 6:25 PM - Reuters closes out the day confirming Apple is within striking distance of becoming only the third company in history to reach $4 trillion in market value.

T,1oegh5d,investing,$GRAB due diligence with positions,"DD: For too long $GRAB has been priced as a “just another” rideshare company. It’s not. Grab is a growing ecosystem of mobility, food and parcel delivery, advertising, and financial services. The company is creating a cohesive set of services that draw users in through one or two products they provide, and then those consumers adapt to using the entire system. It reminds me of Apple, which has a system that consumers adapt to using all the services within it. When you have an IPhone, you are likely to also use Apple Pay, AirPods, Apple Music, and Apple TV. The key of all this is cohesiveness and convenience. Why use multiple different services when you can use those services within one application, where they are all specially tailored to work well together? That’s the beauty of $GRAB. It’s not going to be the next Apple, but it could be the Apple of super apps. Its founder-led, has 7B in cash, 2B in debt at a 26B valuation. Their FCF is up 40% this year and they are set to rocket into profitability this year. I expect earnings to be very strong this quarter, between $0.03 and $0.045 EPS. The coming months are looking very bullish for Grab, especially after this recent pullback from highs. Here’s the next key part of the GRAB thesis: Grab’s user base only makes up about 6% of the total SEA population. That’s projected to grow by about 20-40%, but not double or triple in the next few years. I believe that projection is wrong. Part of Grab’s strategic goal is to tap into the rising prosperity of the population of SEA. But the kicker is that they aren’t just taking advantage of this but actually effectuating rising prosperity in Southeast Asia: Grab’s Financial services arm states they have a mission of serving a large under-banked/un-banked population in SEA through its wallet, payments, embedded finance. Grab offers a banking service and lines of credit to its drivers, who are raised out of poverty by the services Grab provides. But how does the emerging market of SEA relate to the price? I believe the growth of SEA is going to be higher than the projected growth of the company, meaning that revenue will exceed expectations: Rising prosperity and smartphone growth both directly expand Grab’s reach and profitability, obviously. As more Southeast Asians gain smartphones, Grab’s addressable market widens and new users can access rides, deliveries, and digital payments all within the app. Higher disposable income shifts consumers from necessity to convenience: more frequent rides, premium services, and food delivery. With greater digital adoption, people move from cash to GrabPay, strengthening Grab’s financial arm and embedding users deeper in its ecosystem. Each new user increases cross-use of Grab’s services, boosting engagement, data insights, and margins. Meanwhile, merchants and drivers benefit from these same trends, as rising prosperity lets small businesses and gig workers join Grab’s logistics and finance networks, expanding the company’s footprint into new cities and rural markets. So why will growth of SEA outstrip GRAB’s growth projections? Because GRAB actually helps EFFECTUATE the rise in banking, prosperity, and upward mobility. Grab accelerates prosperity in Southeast Asia by connecting people, businesses, and finance through its super-app: It provides steady income to drivers and merchants who once worked informally, digitizing their earnings and making them credit-eligible. Its GrabPay wallet and financial services help millions of unbanked citizens save, borrow, and insure themselves for the first time. By linking small merchants to online customers, Grab expands local business and creates a huge amount of potential for upward mobility. One final thing to address: Many ask, if Grab is so undervalued, why haven’t Institutions stepped in to buy? Why do you think the most successful financial institutions are wrong about $GRAB? Here’s the kicker: $GRAB has over 80% INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP. It’s not the institutions who are wrong, it’s RETAIL. While retail is focused elsewhere, the elites of the financial world are scooping up millions of shares. So I’m buying GRAB before it’s too late. This isn’t financial advice, just my own opinion on the stock and I’ve decided to put my money where my mouth is. I plan to add more and more GRAB shares with every paycheck as well. POSITIONS: GRAB 7C for 12/27: this is the main position, I’m planning to exercise these in a few years. I project GRAB will be above 12 by 2028. Value ~$9,000 GRAB 6-7C 11/14: I’m extremely bullish for earnings, and I think the stock could break past the 6.50s again shortly after. This is a high risk play which I wouldn’t recommend to most. GRAB 6.5-7.5 11/14: Just a $400 lotto ticket for fun GRAB 10-12C 1/21/28: I believe this is the best R/R play for options on GRAB. I plan to buy hundreds more as I build an aggressive position on the stock. At .20 average cost, these have the potential to return almost 900% at expiration.

T,1oifcg3,ValueInvesting,Goodyear Tire (GT),"TLDR: That new funny tv show about tires with Shane Gillis came out and also it has been a goodyear. Also they are at 52 week lows and their fair value is consensus of over $12 🛞 Goodyear Tire (GT) DD – A Surprisingly Good Year Ok, hear me out: Goodyear (GT) is not the sexiest stock in the world. It doesn’t have AI in the name, Elon isn’t tweeting about it, and no one’s buying tires to flex on Instagram. But that’s kind of the point. While everyone’s been distracted by Nvidia melting faces and meme stocks rising from the dead, Goodyear’s quietly had… a good year. Why GT is Interesting Right Now 1. Fundamentals are improving – Goodyear’s been cleaning up its balance sheet, selling off non-core businesses, and paying down debt. It’s not debt-free yet, but the trend is heading the right way. Investors love “turnaround” stories. 2. Stable demand – Cars need tires. Planes need tires. EVs? They chew through tires faster because they’re heavier and accelerate harder. So even if people stop buying new cars, they still have to replace old tires. That gives Goodyear a floor. 3. Cultural clout boost – That Shane Gillis bit about sketchy tire shops went viral, and it’s funny but also free advertising for the concept of tires. Add in the easy pun (“It’s been a Goodyear”) and suddenly you’ve got a brand people are talking about again. 4. Valuation – GT trades at a market cap of ~$4B. For context, that’s tiny compared to car companies or even some EV startups that don’t sell anything. If Goodyear keeps tightening operations and cashing in on steady demand, it’s undervalued relative to its role in the economy. My ANALysis results…. This isn’t a meme YOLO stock. Think of it more like a “boring stock that might quietly double.” Shares under $15 look cheap if management keeps delivering. For degenerates, longer-dated calls could be interesting but this is a long term play, not a lotto ticket.",6,26,2025-10-28 17:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oifcg3/goodyear_tire_gt/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.051410,0.7999999999999999,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'yolo', 'market cap', 'eps']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services

T,1opc3t1,ValueInvesting,"Sven Carlin: From ""Value investor"" to ""Crash Prophet""","A few month ago, I shared my negative experience with Sven Carlin and his research platform. Back then, his investment strategy had already cost many followers dearly (especially in Russia and China). Since then, he seems to have reinvented himself — not as a better investor, but as a crash prophet. These days, almost every video on his channel revolves around the same theme: “The market is overvalued, the crash is coming, brace yourself.” And honestly? It’s obvious why. Fear sells. It’s much more profitable to feed people anxiety than to do solid, objective company analysis that most viewers wouldn’t understand anyway. His current business model feels like “selling bananas to the monkeys” — exploiting fear for clicks and subscriptions. What surprises me most is his arrogance and opportunism. He still manages to lure people onto his platform, only to serve them the same recycled lines like “business as usual” or “nothing new”. To be fair, he occasionally stumbles upon a decent stock idea. But if I had to judge him as a person, I’d say he’s ego-driven and opportunistic, always seeking maximum personal gain — which, in a way, perfectly embodies capitalism itself.

I know I know, historical data doesn’t predict the future, but if the pattern is significant it can give us a hell of an idea of what to expect. Just want to present two pieces of data I found, that show US stocks are likely to continue rally into year end, and also be positive a year from now. The first piece of data is the average returns of s&p 500 from 1950 - Now. It shows that stocks typically bottom on October 27 and rally towards end of year. The second piece of data is the s&p performance a year from a rate cut. Out of 21 times the Fed has cut rates, if the s&p 500 was near 2% of ATH (likely to be the case on Wednesday) the s&p 500 was also positive a year later, 21/21 times.

T,1oj1092,ValueInvesting,Doesn’t make sense.,"I understand that companies are continuing to make profits, fiscal and monetary stimulus remains high, and the hype for AI is not dying down. But honestly wtf just happened today. NVIDA jumped over 5% today on what exactly? The fact that they are making a supercomputer that could run on quantum processors, which are extremely error prone, not useful currently, and will take several years till a significant breakthrough is made? Is it because they are making a supercomputer for Eli Lilly in January that will generate how much revenue exactly? Because they are investing 1 billion in Nokia?? NOKIA?? I’m new to investing, maybe I’m missing something, but all of this just seems like more and more spending. With companies still unable to realize profits from AI. Microsoft stock jumped today on the news that they will own a big chunk of OpenAI’s for profit arm, and that they will purchase 250 billion worth of cloud services. At this point OpenAI probably has a deal to purchase gigawatts from every company out there it’s hard to keep track at this point. Is there not a point where investors go, okay, this is a little much now. NVIDA revealed basically nothing today, and OpenAI continued on their spree of spending with no profits, yet investors just hop in for the vibes. Little concerning to me, especially today.

T,1ofgu9u,ValueInvesting,Paramount Skydance Corp.,"I’ve been digging into PSKY after the Paramount-Skydance merger closed in August 2025. This new media entity combines Paramount’s vast content library with Skydance’s production prowess. The stock’s currently around $16.70, ￼ trading at a dirt-cheap P/S (ttm) of 0.44x; well below industry averages for media companies. ￼ Forward P/E sits at about 12.7, and EV/EBITDA is 19.1. ￼ With a P/B of 1.22, it’s trading slightly above book value (BVPS around $13.70). ￼ David Ellison, Skydance’s founder and now PSKY CEO, is the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. Larry’s providing financial backing ￼ and has ties that could bring Oracle’s AI and cloud tech to enhance content recommendation and personalization, especially for Paramount+. ￼ This tech-media crossover might give PSKY an edge against other streaming services. The overhaul is already running, 2,000+ U.S. layoffs imminent ￼, international cuts, and non-core asset sales (e.g., Telefe network sold Oct 2025sum) ￼. A WBD deal would accelerate this—mass consolidations in studios/TV/streaming, potentially unlocking $4B+ in synergies via overlapping ops (e.g., merging cable networks like MTV and TBS). But debt load could hit $100B+, regulatory hurdles, and integration chaos. In the bigger picture PSKY would become the biggest and most diversified media giant. On a more personal note, most content of the last decade or so sucked, especially because of an unreasonable focus on politics and let’s say modern college culture. Imo it’s easier than maybe ever to take huge market share by simply creating good content without second agendas or underlying motivations. Afai can judge Ellison and Skydance on their past productions (Top Gun: Maverick being the perfect example) they are planning to do just that. Compared to Netflix‘s growth story, this could be the equivalent value play. I wanted to keep this concise, please feel free to add the required details to your comments. And yes, I used AI to quickly write down the relevant numbers, this doesn’t mean I haven’t done my own valuation and DD. I think it’s okay to use AI for convenience in that manner.

Wendy’s has a new strategy to get the turnaround completed. Krispy Kreme recently lost their deal with McDonald’s. Still, high risk high reward?

AMZN,1o2zf8d,wallstreetbets,"[DD] RDDT $2.3M Full Family Port Yolo - BTFD, Betting The Family Dynasty","**TL;DR:** This selloff wasn't based on reduced ChatGPT citations. It was linked to political news (**Charlie Kirk** **RIP** → **Revenge of the 🌈 Bears** → **""Antifun""** (I don't want to end up on the FBI watchlist) **Terrorist Executive Order** → **Congressional hearing postponed** → **🌈 Bears cover before earnings** → **2x Fed rate cuts** → **December S&P 500 inclusion** → **Dynasty**). As a redditor of 16 years, I decided to cash in my years of redditing by full porting not only my account but my parents' as well into RDDT after having completely missed the 2024 rally. From the peak at $282, I expected a ""moderate"" pullback of 15% but was kicked in the balls with a 30% drawdown, wiping out $1mil in profits. Dad calls me asking me, should we should sell? I tell him, no, we buy more, and so we did. Despite all the price target raises to $300, PT reiterates at $300, talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google, high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation, massive earnings beat, and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting, RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day. The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15% despite having already corrected 15% from the peak. And over the past few days, RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping. Something felt off. And so, I decided to add some *wrinkles* to my smoothe brain. # 🧠 What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the 🌈 Bear Case * **“RDDT was overbought.”** *Sure, the stock had run up a lot (relative strength was high). A cooldown was expected. This might explain a* ***normal*** *correction, but not a 30% crash on high volume. Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn't corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment.* * **Decrease in DAU** on sites like Semrush: * *Google eliminated the num=100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites.* [Citizens](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-10-3-reddit-rebounds-analysts-dismiss-ai-fears-as-data-licensing-and-ad-growth-drive-optimism) *even pointed this out in their report, but still no sustainable bounce.* * **ChatGPT reduction in citations**: * [Sam Altman directly/indirectly owns 8.7% of RDDT](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/sam-altmans-reddit-stake-now-worth-over-1-billion-after-earnings-pop.html)*, so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me, unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested.* * *ChatGPT citations alone don't bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5% of RDDT's revenue, so another 15% drop seemed too much especially in the context of a* [new deal being negotiated with Google](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/reddit-stock-ai-deal-google-openai/)*.

Imagine our teachers' faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources. Just because reddit isn't cited, doesn't mean it's not being used at all.* This entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the [MEME ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-resurgence-prompts-return-184355645.html)returned from the grave and ARKK is up 61% YTD. It just didn't make sense. This was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle. I then remembered there was a non-sense hearing scheduled for 10:00am on Oct. 8 which I ignored the first time around. It sounded like it'd be a meme hearing when I imagined u/spez, Gaben, Discord, and Twitch testifying in front of Congress. I also figured out it wasn't going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non-essential government hearing that I've ever heard of. Despite all this, RDDT continued to dump 5% and on Oct. 8 right at 10:00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed, RDDT bounced. I thought to myself, did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled. **Then it clicked. My second wrinkle** popped into existence. I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline. # 🕓Timeline of Events * 9/4: [Nepal bans](https://cpj.org/2025/09/nepal-orders-ban-on-major-social-media-platforms/) 26 social media platforms * 9/7: Reddit announces it is [sunsetting public chats](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/41918962981908-Changelog-October-7-2025) * 9/8: Start of Nepalese Gen Z [protests organized over Discord](https://www.newsweek.com/morocco-nepal-gen-z-is-using-discord-rise-up-10821410) * 9/9 Nepalese Gen Z protesters [burned alive](https://www.newsweek.com/wife-ex-nepali-prime-minister-burnt-alive-parliament-set-fire-live-updates-2126979) the Prime Minister of Nepal's wife * 9/10: RIP Charlie Kirk.

Massive swings on this day. * 9/18: RDDT peaks at $283 * 9/19-9/21: RDDT starts a seemingly healthy correction * 9/22: Trump declares ""[Antifun](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/)"" a foreign terrorist organization * 9/23: RDDT drops another 7.8% and closes at $237.45 * 9/29-10/1: RDDT drops from $245 to $202.60 while the rest of the market was breaking to new ATH * 10/8: RDDT bottoms out at 195.01 at 10:30am, 30 minutes after the originally scheduled 10:00am hearing. ""Antifun"" round table discussion led by Trump and other Republicans discuss. * 10/9: RDDT breaks out of the bull flag and begins its road to recovery # 🤯From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain After putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks, everything made so much more sense. There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media, to the point it spooked bulls. The smart money took profits and the **🌈** Bears shorted RDDT bigly, betting that u/spez would be crucified at the hearing. At the hearing, **Spez would be in a lose/lose situation** where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing, bans users who threaten violence, etc. and **agree to do whatever the Congressional circus** demands him to do, otherwise, **they would threaten to remove reddit's** [**Section 230 immunity**](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46751) which would **result in reddit being liable** as a publisher for what redditors post. **A death sentence ☠️ for reddit and all social media companies**. This would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech, and I'm sure many redditors would threaten to leave. Spez also can't pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more. The concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats. While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r/redditstock, I don't use it much personally but I know other redditors love it. What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes. It wouldn't surprise me if there may have been a few ""Antifun"" individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone. In the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors, I speculate that Sam Altman, an 8.7% shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days, may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior, reddit was frequently cited making up 41% of LLM citations. Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus. Either way, Altman wouldn't want to risk being on Trump's shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit. That would risk development of Star Gate. What I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI's relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change. Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate. Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4.95 rating and over 3,000 reviews. Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af. # 🔬Testing My Theory If my interpretation of the timeline holds true, I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time, even though they weren't invited for the hearing. And look, META and RDDT's movement look quite similar. The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity . But with the ""Antifun"" terrorist designation, well, that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies. AMZN (Twitch/Hassan Piker) and NFLX (streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of ""Antifun"") also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September. All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe ""Antifun"" short covering started. And if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings, I thought, why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen. Gun stocks are up 30% from September, and GLD is at the moon. So yes, there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing. # 💎💰🚀The Trade Thesis The **🌈** Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown. After seeing that the ""Antifun"" roundtable didn't trigger a full on collapse below yesterday's support, this signaled that the ""Antifun"" trade bottomed out and the covering started. Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of 🐂🐳Bull whales with **$7.5M** in **210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls** which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout. There are still a lot more **🌈** Bears who haven't made this ""Antifun"" short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme, is no longer useful to AI, and will miss on earnings. They're about to get blown out as **Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10/15 at 85% odds**. RDDT earnings is on Oct 30, so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings. I actually see **RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown** as this just delays the upcoming hearing. With \~16-18% short interest, RDDT's tiny float, and an earnings blackout period coming up, the time is now to give the **🌈** Bears a new gap. With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in, I think we'll break to new ATHs post earnings. I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event. After a new ATH and 2 back-to-back rate cuts, this would make RDDT a top contender for S&P 500 inclusion in the December S&P 500 balancing. RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit. Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion. Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December. 🚀🚀🚀 # 😶‍🌫️Conclusion - Make Money Doing What You Love There isn't a more wrinkle-brain move than to make millions from my 16 years of redditing.

JPM,1odpohp,stocks,Teladoc (TDOC) Earnings 10/29 -- Turnaround Incoming,"Greetings. I've been watching Teladoc for about 9 months, time to share my findings. I made some higher buys early in the year and have averaged down to 5000 shares @ 8.50. Teladoc is not just some leftover garbage from the pandemic. This is a growing international company (active in 130 countries) that offers solutions across a broad range of healthcare both for providers, patients, and enterprise customers. Telehealth and this company ARE the future. The same way streaming killed Blockbuster. The same way Amazon killed Sears. With healthcare, it will be more like how rideshare has affected taxis. Legacy healthcare is going not going away and plenty of instances where in person visits are required, but there are many instances that will gravitate to telehealth. There are already companies that can use your own smartphone camera to diagnose strep throat with around 92% accuracy. Technological advances such as this are going to continue to move us away from a healthcare service model that has not changed much in the last ~75 years. Telehealth can reduce unnecessary ER visits and do it at a lower cost to patients and insurers. Healthcare costs in the US are out of control and telehealth is continually looked at as an option to reduce costs of service. Medicare & Medicaid are expected to continue utilizing telehealth. COVID Era Telehealth provisions have already been extended twice. That portion of the bill to re-open the government has bipartisan support. Healthcare costs and specifically insurance premiums are going to be a huge focus of discussion in the next month. Telehealth will be a part of that discussion. Share Price $8.30 TDOC Annual Sales are around $2.6 Billion. Market cap $1.5B--Try to find another stock with over 2.5B in sales and a market cap less than 1.6B! I don't believe there is one. TDOC has 100 Million active users across 130 countries in 40 languages. One simple justification for a higher valuation is that you simply could not build what this company already has for 1.5B. Free Cash Flow around $185 Million. Cash on hand is around $600M Debt is also around $600M (due in 2026 and 2027--IIRC) They retired $500M in debt with cash in Q2. They secured a $300M revolving line of credit from JPM a couple of months ago. Golden Cross activated. 50 day MA: 8.03 200 day MA: 7.64 Short interest is ~14% of the float with ~3.5 days to cover. Not much of a factor here. Citron (🤮) has shared some positive releases on this stock over the last 6 months. Price targets have also been raised. Most recently was Citigroup up to $10.5. If you've made it this far maybe you've looked at a chart. It doesn't look good. This stock got way ahead of itself during the pandemic. And then they wasted a HUGE sum of money to buy Livongo and their earnings have been getting smoked by goodwill write-downs ever since. Competition and churn in their online therapy division ""Betterhelp"" led the company to slight revenue decline for several quarters. A recent acquisition, ""Uplift"" allows Betterhelp to accept insurance now. It had previously been cash pay only and patients were not sticking to the service. Uplift should patch the leaky bucket at Betterhelp and stop the revenue decline there. Integrated Care and Chronic care monitoring services are experiencing growth. Those segments of the business have led the charge of the turn around. They've made at least 3 all cash acquisitions in 2025. Uplift Catapult Telecare (Australia) Additional new services coming online: --A new Employee Assistance Program, Wellbound, is launching in January 2026--(announced in July 2025). About Wellbound: ""The new program, purpose-built for the company’s employer and health plan clients in the U.S., leverages Teladoc Health’s unmatched scale, clinical product portfolio and consumer engagement expertise to help organizations create a powerful “on-ramp” for long-term employee wellness."" -- Virtual Sitter and Clarity -- AI solutions for in patient monitoring and healthcare worker safety. Clarity is new, focused on protecting healthcare workers from Violence. This definitely means they are going to say ""AI"" on the 10/29 earnings call, so it HAS to go up, right? Something to keep an eye on: There have been rumors that the UK's NHS is planning to re-vamp/launch a country-wide online health/hospital service. They will be partnering with existing telehealth companies to provide this service. It is not yet announced which companies they will use for this though. Positions: 5000 shares at $8.50 50 contracts X dates from November 21 2025 to Jan 2027 from at various strikes from $7.5-10. Earnings call on 10/29 should show continued turnaround. Hopefully picking up the pace. This is not financial advice. Just my own bull case for a punished possibly overlooked stock. Trade at your own risk. Sorry if this reads like shit.

AAPL,1oqwc3k,investing,Is my portfolio too risky? Planning to hold long term.,"Hey everyone, I’d love to get some thoughts on my portfolio and whether it’s too risky for someone planning to just buy and hold long term (10+ years). Here’s my current taxable portfolio (~$4,600 total): • VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) – 36.3% • SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) – 9.2% • VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) – 6.7% • QQQM (Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF) – 6.7% • SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) – 6.0% • TSLA (Tesla) – 5.4% • AAPL (Apple) – 4.8% • GOOGL (Alphabet) – 4.5% • NVDA (NVIDIA) – 4.4% • ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) – 4.3% • AMZN (Amazon) – 4.0% • MSFT (Microsoft) – 3.5% • U (Unity Software) – 2.0% • TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor) – 1.4% I started this portfolio in June 2024 and have been adding monthly. It’s up about 23% overall. I plan to just hold everything and not sell. 2) At the same time, I recently opened a Roth IRA, and I’m mainly investing in VOO and QQQM there. Would you say my overall setup is too risky? Should I diversify more into bonds or other ETFs? I’m okay with short-term volatility, but I do want to be smart about long-term balance.

AMZN,1okpl3u,pennystocks,$MSAI ( an actual DD  ),"let me start by addressing the elephant in the room; i am long MSAI and have 5000 shares at $1.20 ish. Ok let's start with their business model ✅the who MSAI - MultiSensor AI Holdings, inc, they are a technology specializing in AI multi-sensing platform; basically high tech sensors. company has been around a long time since 1995 and they aim to be the leader in predictive maintenance of industrial assets/environments. now, what does that even mean. say for example if Amazon were to build an automated/extremely high technology warehouse that requires very little man power, they will need alot of sensors in different parts of the warehouse ( kind of like their eyes on the ground ) to monitor and PREDICT before things go wrong. this is extremely important and kind of like the pain sensors in our human body.. when you feel pain or discomfort in some parts of your body.. you will attempt to go to the doctor to troubleshoot if there is something wrong BEFORE it turns into a big deal. ✅targeted market Distribution and Logistics Manufacturing Oil and Gas AI warehouses fully automated ports ghost factories as humans advance in technology, ghost factories, fully automated ports are becoming more and more common; eliminating the usage of human operated machine. you can google this or i've attached some sources below ( very reliable news source from singapore ) https://www.sustainability-times.com/energy/theyre-moving-65-million-without-humans-worlds-largest-automated-port-set-to-rewrite-the-rules-of-global-shipping-forever/ https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/ghost-factories-are-a-warning-sign-for-green-manufacturings-future ✅the recent rumor credit to OG post for bringing up this counter, the recent rumor is that MSAI could be working with AMZN due to their increasing need to turn to AI run warehouses, some of the hints include laying off their employees ( https://evrimagaci.org/gpt/amazon-layoffs-signal-shift-in-tech-workforce-514411 ) , set up of ghost warehouses for logistics and most important MSAI hire of an EX amazon staff into the board ( Mr. Luke Grice-Lowe held several roles within Amazon's reliability and maintenance engineering teams ) MSAI also mentioned working with a global distribution leader 14th oct 2025 (https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=5374384416805784&symbol=MSAI) ✅upcoming earnings date & financials est 11/11/2025 their total debt is only $60,000 with a total revenue of approx $5.5 mil and net income of -$18mil, which is normal for high growth companies. balance sheet states a working capital of $4.5mil with a recent private placement of $15mil - indicates they have quite a long run way barring any unexpected hiccups in liquidity MSAI also has an extremely high gross margin of around 60%, which when and IF scaled properly could easily turn this company into a profitable company IF any announcement is to be made , my guess is this upcoming earnings could be it. with OR without the AMZN, this is a company i would be willing to invest in for the long haul because i am of the view that ghost factories, AI run warehouses and companies that require a lot of stock organization is ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE FUTURE. this is very bullish for a company in terms of demand for MSAI. ✅other bullish news patents submitted and awaiting approval - Publication ID (example): US-20240164645-A1 Title: ""Apparatus for noninvasive veterinary screening and diagnosis."" Status: Pending. imagine animals being scanned without invasive apparatus. this is and will be a very important and unique patent as the animal care market is a VERY BIG MARKET. ✅LINKEDIN SEARCH 3 days ago from Asim, ceo and president "" We’re growing!

T,1omm7xs,wallstreetbets,$POET — The Photon Dealer That You're Missing,"https://preview.redd.it/d4wloobahvyf1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa04d70d08941aa680b19beb2fe1642e6047ed5 **TL;DR** POET, a $500M photonics company sitting with real tech and [patents](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/poet-technologies-inc), makes AI servers move at light speed (literally). The AI arms race can’t scale without faster pipes, and POET is literally selling the pipes. Current market cap is peanuts compared to what it could be if even a fraction of this narrative hits. My play: **Jan 16 2026 $10C** for a clean 5x if we tag $10, and **Jan 15 2027 $10C** for the “retire in shameful glory” 10x+ upside. Not financial advise, assess your own risk. # Why You Should Even Care About $POET? Alright you smooth-brained degenerates, put down your $NVDA FDs and listen. There’s a sub-$600M photonics company quietly gearing up to feed the AI data-center monster that everyone keeps screaming about. It’s called **POET Technologies**, ticker **$POET**, and they’re building the plumbing that lets GPUs talk to each other at light speed. Copper is cooked. Every AI chip out there is choking on data bandwidth. POET shows up like “what if photons, bro?” Their secret sauce is this thing called the **Optical Interposer**, which basically crams light and silicon into one chip so data moves faster, cheaper, and cooler. That’s the entire pitch — light good, heat bad, tendies pending. **Credit: Read** [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lw1ft3/poet_the_10_bagger_you_dont_know_about/) **for more company details if you are new to $POET**. # Retard Section Begins Here If you missed $NVDA, $AMD, $AVGO, this is your redemption arc. We’re still early enough that institutions are only starting to load up. If you like stupid asymmetric returns, please read on. Let’s walk through what’s been dropping in just the last month: * On **October 28**, they closed a **$150M oversubscribed direct offering**. “Oversubscribed” means people were fighting for shares. The new investors didn’t even get a discount — they paid roughly **$7.25/share**, the same as retail. Institutions don’t throw money at a small-cap photonics play for fun. They see growth. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-150-million-oversubscribed-registered-direct-offering-of-common-shares)\] * On **October 22**, they announced a **$5M production order** for their 800G optical engines. That’s not a prototype, that’s an actual order for actual products. The kind of thing that moves them from “science project” to “revenue story.” \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-receives-5-million-production-order-for-800g-optical-engines)\] * On **October 7**, another **$75M private investment** landed to scale their AI connectivity business. That’s two major capital events in one month. Most penny semis can’t raise pocket change, these guys raised nearly a quarter billion. \[[source](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-announces-closing-of-us-75-million-investment-to-accelerate-growth-in-ai-connectivity-solutions)\] * They’ve also been stacking partnerships very recently — **Semtech**, **Sivers Semiconductor**, plus a handful of industry awards. This isn’t vapor; these are real names in the optics space that actually matter. \[[source 1](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-sivers-semiconductors-collaborate-on-external-light-sources-for-co-packaged-optics-and-next-generation-ai-market), [source 2](https://www.poet-technologies.com/news/poet-technologies-and-semtech-launch-1-6t-optical-receivers-for-ai-networks)\] Put all that together, and you get a company moving from hype to execution faster than most of Wall Street can spell “photonics.” # Technicals and Sentiment Yeah, the stock dumped about 30% recently. Before you call that a rug, realize every major bullish catalyst hit after that drop. We’re sitting on the lower band of a clean ascending channel. Historically, that’s where the smart money reloads. DO NOT WALK INTO THE BEAT TRAP. Put your seat belts on and ride with smart money. The community is waking up too. The $POET subreddit grew from **2k visitors to 10k in a month** — that’s not retail noise, that’s early-phase momentum. https://preview.redd.it/dpkkujubhvyf1.png?width=2536&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0c97bfe8db784c96b00eb0b64d25b1c59f6aa8 Option flow backs it up. Last run to $9.41 saw **600k calls traded in a single day**. Current put-call open interest ratio sits around **0.07**, which is stupidly bullish for a small-cap. There are over **780k calls** sitting on open interest right now, and open interest has been steady for months at least since June, not just a one-day gamma spike. An once-in-a-lifetime moment is secretly brewing. https://preview.redd.it/ut4sjvxchvyf1.png?width=2518&format=png&auto=webp&s=febff6ad84a2ba6bdd4347cffa5f92a8fa5677f9 Market makers are hedging in a way that creates a positive **GEX (gamma exposure)** setup — meaning the lower it goes, the more they have to buy. We’re under the $7 put wall and facing the $10 call wall. That means dealers will buy back shares to create their hedge. If price breaks $10, hedging could shove this thing straight to $12 or higher. An 85% return in stock price, or multi-bagger for long calls. https://preview.redd.it/yeviu27ehvyf1.png?width=2458&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffb856391db297da1fa6a094426dac3727823841 The main risk of the setup is execution and timing. But given the current slew of great news, I'm confident that we are on a very good track. # Market Tailwinds Now here’s where it gets even spicier. The macro setup is starting to line up for small-cap revenge season: * **November is historically a strong month** for equities. Seasonality matters — funds love window-dressing into year-end. * **Fed rate cuts and the end of QT in December** mean more liquidity sloshing into risk assets. Cash gets bored; bored cash buys small caps. * **70% of institutional investors are underperforming** this year. They’re desperate to make up ground before Q4 closes. * That means we’re looking at a **year-end chase** — rotations out of mega-caps and into “what hasn’t run yet.” Small-cap tech fits that bill perfectly if liquidity condition improves. Combine that macro tailwind with POET’s catalysts, and we’ve got a setup where funds have to chase growth stories like this into the new year. # The Setup Right now you’ve got: * Fundamental catalysts (orders, capital, partnerships). * A technical setup sitting on support. * Option flow that looks like someone knows something. * A small float that can actually move when retail catches on. * Macro market tailwinds. Target for end of 2025 is **$10–$12**, which puts it around a $1B market cap conservatively. If the photonics hype actually lands and POET keeps landing contracts, $30 by mid-2026 isn’t insane. This is what asymmetric risk looks like. Worst case you lose your call premium and post memes about it. Best case, you’re the guy who bought the photon dealer before Wall Street figured it out. # Closing Thoughts The AI boom doesn’t work without faster data pipes. POET builds the pipes. Institutions are buying. The retail crowd hasn’t caught on. We’re in the dumb zone where the risk looks huge and the reward looks ridiculous — which is exactly where the biggest money gets made. Play it however you want. Just don’t pretend you weren’t warned when this thing lights up like a data-center laser array. Strategies? Buy Jan 16 2026 $10 call and chill with Jan 15 2027 $10. If you're hesitant, please wait this turns into a multi-bagger and be like ""OH, I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT. IT'S ON MY WATCHLIST FOREVER"". **Position** Adding more 1-3 months and leap calls as long as the price stays under on the lower band of the ascending channel. https://preview.redd.it/me1bqi0hhvyf1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=478a056abf53c5615ffdfcd9a32f260be95aae75 Edit: Previous post removed for unknown reasons.

T,1ohm7o7,wallstreetbets,NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius),"TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025. Positions: 8k worth of call options with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position. Will likely be adding into further OTM strikes as well, probably $140 and $150 when other funds settle. If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought. I did take a 3k loss due to this mistake earlier (that’s ok I’m fucking stupid) —————————————————————————— Company overview Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024. Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers. Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets. —————————————————————————— Earnings preview [Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025. As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth. [Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call. The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this. It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers. Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25 Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well. —————————————————————————— Other tech earnings MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week.

T,1ocdk6m,wallstreetbets,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard. The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution. You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a >20% drop the next week. **The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:** A wise man once told me history is a flat circle. Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/). The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total). [Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a) Now, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls. If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26 GLD 500C option (the farthest OTM currently available) at the current price of 2.14 (market close 20OCT25): **Scenario 1 (1979-1980 Repeat) - GLD doubles to 800 by end of year: Option has $300 of intrinsic value; 14,300% return** **Scenario 2 (Partial Repeat) - GLD increases 50% to 600 by end of year: Option has $100 of intrinsic value; 4,760% return** **Scenario 3 (Continuing trend) - GLD increases 25% to 500 by end of the year: Option has estimated $10 of extrinsic value 2 weeks from expiration; 476% return** **Scenario 4: GLD doesn't increase that much: -100% return** Now, I spy the glint of gold in many of your eyes. But others are muttering among yourselves, “Yet another meme stock. Last time I played one of those, my wife's boyfriend grounded me for a week.“ But here is why gold is uniquely positioned for such a move: gold is a physical object that has served as a trusted store of value for literally all of recorded history. I'll bet almost everyone here has at least one grandparent who hoards precious metals like a geriatric dragon. As a result, many poor souls who've never even heard of meme stocks will plunge into this frothing storm without knowing the perils of speculative markets They don't need charts or a brokerage to buy gold; they just go to their nearest Coin and Jewellery store with their Wendy's paycheck. A second factor today is the sheer access to leverage that did not exist in the 1979's-1980s. Back then, no ETFs even existed. No GLD, no SLV, nothing. And you had to call your broker to place a trade. But today, any room-temperature IQ degenerate can YOLO their entire net worth into 0dte calls on margin at the touch of a button. We just live in an era of rapid and rampant speculation. So now, let me give you a little background on the state of gold in general. If your bored, you can just skip ahead to my positions and exit strategy. **Gold Distribution:** Across the world, there is only 216,000 tons of gold in circulation as of the end of 2024. Approximately half is held as jewelry which includes 34,600 tons and 31,000 tons held by Indian and Chinese households, respectively. Another 38,000 tons is held by central banks. 49,000 tons are held as bars and coins (including ETFs) and finally, 32,000 tons in other uses (industrial, etc). [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/data\/how-much-gold](https://preview.redd.it/ycdnsoy4zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8bd50ba2171b41e63e368d5b37bccdfa127bee) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-kw2lzyo7rgwf1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bca613ec3fec7508590af3de870a76c6f4ba61d) Gold Supply: In 2024, 3660 tons of gold was mined which is roughly 1.7% of the total supply. While mining efforts are likely ramping up, this should not impact supply that much over the duration of our voyage. [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/research\/gold-demand-trends\/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024](https://preview.redd.it/rv3h9wq6zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4135b0c31f240f3bc13cfb6e5ffdec5b37e7e6) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-v0te84o9rgwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bed6835419fbf38ed1d44e180b263493cd0c18d) A greater risk for supply is for people to start selling their gold bullion or jewellery to take advantage of the high prices which is listed as Recycled Gold in the chart above. During 2024, this accounted for 1370 tons, but this will undoubtedly increase as the price of gold increases. In accounts of the 1979-1980 mania, there were suddenly many gold and silver buyers popping up near the end; the modern equivalent would be getting spam texts asking you to sell your silver and gold (like you get for houses currently). This will be a sign the end is near. I will also be monitoring headlines for news of mass retail selling of gold and silver, especially in places like India and China where the population owns a tremendous amount of gold.

The US has been unable to get spending under control and continues to spend like a drunken pirate on shore. While the US is highly unlikely to actually default, the government will print to meet debt requirements, devaluing the currency. If you knew that you would be taking an inflationary haircut on any of your treasury holdings, would you really keep as many? https://preview.redd.it/teqt2yrfzgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=605469cc135657a8d1d1e2fe6e2ee445b0180320 Another common talking point driving gold prices is that Central banks are buying lots of gold and several countries, notably Turkey, have laws which gives the central bank the right to buy any gold produced in the country at market prices. Overall, Central Banks bought over 1000 tons of gold in 2023 and 2024. Gold has increased to over 20% of all central bank holdings while US treasuries have fallen. [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-pguftcpirgwf1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=091e2329354eda2c1a6411fdd2836ae24a76fddf) Another more speculative reason for gold rising is high level talks about a BRICS gold-backed currency. This currency would serve as replacement for the US Dollar for trade in a scenario where another hegemonic power did not arise. **Position and Sizing:** As an established pirate, my chest of booty has well over a million doubloons from plundering the land o’ Kohls. If GLD sinks down to Davy Jone’s locker, most of me plunder will remain safe. Don’t be blinded by your greed and wager your whole ship. You should be willing to lose any money that you put on this; but the asymmetry of this play makes it attractive to me.

No one every blew up their account from taking profits. My plan is to take out my cost basis when the position reaches between 4x and 5x value. From there, I plan on selling another tranche every time it doubles: 10x, 20x, 40x, 80x, and 160x. Here are some other exit conditions: \-Gold prices break down from the current trendline. For example, in premarket today, gold dropped 3%. I would say if we close below Friday's low (\~386), that would invalidate the bubble thesis. \-If there are news articles or social media posts about people selling gold en masse THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",397,188,2025-10-21 13:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ocdk6m/setting_sail_for_plunder_gld_dd_and_yolo/,2025-11-07 16:42:40.572428,0.5,$T,1.0,['GLD'],"['bull', 'calls', 'yolo', 'baghold', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss']",1.0,Communication Services
T,1oevi2q,stocks,The construction company that has quietly beaten NVIDIA over the last 5 years,"Comfort Systems USA ($FIX) has truly defied all odds. A boring HVAC / mechanical, electrical and plumbing consolidator that has outperformed Nvidia over the last 5 years, showing an outrageous share price appreciation from $55 to $980, delivering nearly a 17x return, all while still not appearing on any mainstream media outlet or gaining significant coverage. You still won’t find this stock on the earnings calendar from EW or rarely any mentions on CNBC. While many say that Nvidia has been the “picks and shovels” of AI, I think in a more literal sense, it has been Comfort Systems USA. $FIX seen tremendous EPS growth, revenue growth and margin expansion on the back of the data center buildout boom to cool these structures and has just delivered another record Q3 beat. They allocate about 75% of their capital to future acquisitions, 15% to buybacks and 10% for dividends. Growth does not appear to be slowing down in the MEP industry. There has been a significant tailwind in recent years for $FIX and revenue growth has averaged 30%, EPS nearly doubling from 2022-2024, and again from 2024 to 2025, with a ROIC of 40%. $FIX maintains a huge backlog of 9.3B and the CEO Brian Lane says that business is so high that they are being selective in their projects and picking only the best work. Management appears highly competent and Brian is clearly steering the ship the right way. Initial annualized EPS expectations for 2025 were around $17-18. After delivering a tremendous Q2 beat, that shot up analysts expectations to $22-$24. Now after another whopping Q3 beat, YTD EPS sits at $19.53, over an entire quarter ahead of expectations for the year from initial early estimates. I’m now strongly considering Q4 EPS will land between $9.50-$10.50, which would put YTD EPS of about $30. At the current price of about $980, this would basically be a trailing PE of 32. Based on the 10Q just released, management believes this level of strong business will continue through 2026. Now, if this level of growth were to continue through 2026, the shares are still trading at a significant discount, but expectations of doubling each year quickly has its limits. Continuing to hold this name will be highly dependent on your conviction of the AI infrastructure buildout continuing.

T,1oqa0ij,ValueInvesting,This subreddit has lost its way,"I wonder if how many of you have ever read any books on value investing or even understand the basic concept, you aren’t buying a company cheap for it to turnaround overnight. I know this recent phenomenon of dopamine investors has changed people’s mindsets, they believe a long term investment is a year, when in reality it’s at least 5+. It sucks i’m adding to the problem by just posting another general discussion post, but I think it’s important to remember some good quotes of some legendary value investors. “A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price.” - Benjamin Graham “Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.” - Benjamin Graham “The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.” - Benjamin Graham “The investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment.” - Benjamin Graham ""When things go from terrible to semi-terrible to OK, you can make a lot of money."" - Peter Lynch “One point I made in One Up that's still true is that the key organ in your body when it comes to investing is not the brain, it's the stomach…You have to do the work and use your brain, but who's got the stomach when something bad happens, like oil goes up, or a recession, Covid, the Ukraine invasion, people being murdered left and right, January 6th and what happened in Washington DC. These are things that happen and then the market goes down…What does your stomach do? Are you getting up at night? I mean, can you sleep with your stocks? If you're getting up at 3:00 AM and looking things over, you shouldn't be investing.” - Peter Lynch ""The single greatest edge an investor can have is a long-term orientation."" - Seth Klarman “Here’s the key to understanding risk: it’s largely a matter of opinion” - Howard Marks “There’s only one way to describe most investors: trend followers. Superior investors are the exact opposite. Superior investing, as I hope I’ve convinced you by now, requires second level thinking…a way of thinking that’s different from that of others, more complex and more insightful.” - Howard Marks “Skepticism and pessimism aren’t synonymous. Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive. But it also calls for optimism when pessimism is excessive.” - Howard Marks “Every once in a while, an up-or-down-leg goes on for a long time and/or to a great extreme and people start to say ""this time it's different."" They cite the changes in geopolitics, institutions, technology or behaviour that have rendered the ""old rules"" obsolete. They make investment decisions that extrapolate the recent trend. And then it turns out that the old rules still apply and the cycle resumes. In the end, trees don't grow to the sky, and few things go to zero.” - Howard Marks",101,42,2025-11-06 20:30:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oqa0ij/this_subreddit_has_lost_its_way/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.835149,0.5,$T,0.6,[],['calls'],1.0,Communication Services
T,1omlpq7,ValueInvesting,PayPal Stock Forecast 2030,"Hey everyone, just revised my PayPal forecasting to account for Q3 and new partnership opportunities. Despite the underperformance, PayPal is probably my favorite value play heading into year end and I am consistently adding to my personal position (2027 Leaps). For credibility purposes my equal weight return on all of my work this year has now breached an over 60% return if you bought each equity (equal $ amount in shares) on the day of publication. Some of my best performers: 1. Jumia (355%) 2. Hood (234%) 3. AMD (199%) 4. RKLB (178%) 5. SOFI (170%) 6. IREN (132%) 7. GOOG (83%) 8. BABA (50%) PayPal Stock currently trades around 12x forward earnings. CEO Alex Chriss has refocused the business and cleaned up low TPV deals and cost structures. They’re returning real capital now roughly 5% of the float bought back annually and a new dividend (10% of earnings). Margins are expanding, revenue is reaccelerating, and free cash flow keeps climbing. Growth engines are firing again: * Braintree is taking share in enterprise checkout (the unbranded side) * Venmo is growing debit card usage and small-business payments * BNPL volumes are up double digits, profitable, and integrated directly into checkout * And the new partnerships are huge: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and even college football (Sponsorships and processing NIL payments via Venmo) PayPal is finally back in offense mode and has the cash to do so profitably. They're already on track for double-digit revenue growth next year *without* AI tailwinds. If the new platform integrations start contributing even modestly, EPS growth should easily continue to outpace revenue thanks to buybacks. **Valuation Scenarios (2030)** * **Bear:** 6% revenue CAGR, \~14% EPS CAGR → \~$180 price target (assuming AI is a total bust for the business) * **Base:** 11% revenue CAGR, \~21% EPS CAGR → \~$280 (AI is a modest tailwind) * **Bull:** 15% revenue CAGR, \~26% EPS CAGR → \~$420 (PayPal captures meaningful share of agentic commerce payments) It’s worth remembering: PayPal’s entire rise two decades ago came from being embedded on eBay, which had a fraction of today’s digital user base. Now it’s plugging into OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google: ecosystems with potentially billions of users. That’s a similar setup, just multiplied massively in scale. At 12x forward earnings and massive cash generation, you don’t need heroics here from the stock. The market has priced PayPal for stagnation and even decline. I love the huge margin of safety that's provided by the core business, buybacks, and now a dividend (that also opens the stock up to new flows from ETF investment). Sentiment continues to drag the stock down, but this seems to be changing quite a bit on socials. In my experience retail usually picks up on this a few months before the street. The major risks are purely executional at this time and I feel very confident with Chriss at the helm. The path ahead is an easy win for returning shareholder value as a baseline, with massive upside from BNPL, Venmo, and the agentic commerce opportunity.",65,38,2025-11-02 16:26:18,https://northwiseproject.com/paypal-stock-forecast-2030/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.869386,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'earnings', 'dividend', 'volume', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.9457142857142856,Communication Services
T,1onmx2o,wallstreetbets,$KMB: Why I’m stupidly bullish on Kimberly-Clark after the KVUE deal,"Alright degenerates, here’s the pitch. Kimberly-Clark ($KMB) just did something Wall Street absolutely hates in the short term but loves five quarters later: they bought growth that actually prints money. They’re dropping $48.7 billion (cash + stock) to buy Kenvue ($KVUE) — that’s the company behind Tylenol, Band-Aid, Listerine, Zyrtec, Neutrogena, Johnson’s Baby, etc. Basically, they raided Johnson & Johnson’s medicine cabinet. KMB already owns Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, Cottonelle. Add Kenvue’s lineup and you’ve got a monster with over $32 billion in annual revenue touching every corner of the household aisle. What just happened Deal terms: $3.50 cash + 0.14625 shares of KMB per KVUE share. KVUE shot up on the headline. KMB cratered double-digits because analysts love to panic about debt and dilution. That’s the entry. The fear is temporary; the synergy is permanent. This is the exact same movie we’ve seen a hundred times: big staple buys a complementary portfolio, market screams “overpay!” then six months later it rerates after synergy numbers show up in EPS. Why this deal actually makes sense Management is guiding for around $2 billion a year in cost synergies. Even if they hit half, that’s a meaningful margin bump on $32 billion in revenue. The product overlap is clean: tissues + cold medicine, diapers + baby lotion, bath tissue + skincare. Cross-sell city. One marketing engine, one distribution network, better ad ROI. KMB already runs a tight supply chain; integration risk is real but manageable. Why the market’s reaction is wrong The Street is obsessing over debt and short-term dilution, ignoring the long-term free cash flow power. KMB throws off cash like crazy. Even post-deal they can delever inside two years if they care to. Once leverage normalizes, the multiple expands again. This company isn’t betting on hype. It’s betting on brand gravity. Consumers are not cutting back on diapers, tissues, or painkillers because of macro headlines. My plan I’m accumulating shares and calls while sentiment is garbage. I expect a slow rerate over the next 12–18 months as: 1. Deal approvals roll in. 2. Early synergy savings show up in SG&A. 3. KMB reiterates the dividend (which they absolutely will). 4. Debt ratios improve quarter by quarter. Bear arguments (and why I don’t care) Litigation overhangs: already priced into KVUE, KMB knew what it was buying. Integration risk: that’s every big merger ever; KMB’s ops team is seasoned. EPS dilution: near-term pain, long-term gain. Final thoughts KMB just turned itself from a sleepy tissue company into a global health-and-wellness powerhouse. The market hates change; that’s why there’s opportunity. When everyone realizes KMB now owns the medicine cabinet and the bathroom shelf, today’s dump will look like free money. I’m long $KMB because the brands are unstoppable, the cash flow is sticky, and the selloff is overblown.

T,1oeaiip,wallstreetbets,$GRAB 15k YOLO and DD,"DD: For too long $GRAB has been priced as a “just another” rideshare company. It’s not. Grab is a growing ecosystem of mobility, food and parcel delivery, advertising, and financial services. The company is creating a cohesive set of services that draw users in through one or two products they provide, and then those consumers adapt to using the entire system. It reminds me of Apple— a system that consumers adapt to using all the services within it. When you have an IPhone, you are likely to also use Apple Pay, AirPods, Apple Music, and Apple TV. The key of all this is cohesiveness and convenience. Why use multiple different services when you can use those services within one application, where they are all specially tailored to work well together? That’s the beauty of $GRAB. It’s not going to be the next Apple, but it could be the Apple of super apps. Its founder-led, has 7B in cash, 2B in debt at a 26B valuation. Their FCF is up 40% this year and they are set to rocket into profitability this year. I expect earnings to be very strong this quarter, between $0.03 and $0.045 EPS. The coming months are looking very bullish for Grab, especially after this recent pullback from highs. Here’s the next key part of the GRAB thesis: Grab’s user base only makes up about 6% of the total SEA population. That’s projected to grow by about 20-40%, but not double or triple in the next few years. I believe that projection is wrong. Part of Grab’s strategic goal is to tap into the rising prosperity of the population of SEA. But the kicker is that they aren’t just taking advantage of this but actually effectuating rising prosperity in Southeast Asia: Grab’s Financial services arm states they have a mission of serving a large under-banked/un-banked population in SEA through its wallet, payments, embedded finance. Grab offers a banking service and lines of credit to its drivers, who are raised out of poverty by the services Grab provides. But how does the emerging market of SEA relate to the price? I believe the growth of SEA is going to be higher than the projected growth of the company, meaning that revenue will exceed expectations: Rising prosperity and smartphone growth both directly expand Grab’s reach and profitability, obviously. As more Southeast Asians gain smartphones, Grab’s addressable market widens and new users can access rides, deliveries, and digital payments all within the app. Higher disposable income shifts consumers from necessity to convenience: more frequent rides, premium services, and food delivery. With greater digital adoption, people move from cash to GrabPay, strengthening Grab’s financial arm and embedding users deeper in its ecosystem. Each new user increases cross-use of Grab’s services, boosting engagement, data insights, and margins. Meanwhile, merchants and drivers benefit from these same trends, as rising prosperity lets small businesses and gig workers join Grab’s logistics and finance networks, expanding the company’s footprint into new cities and rural markets. So why will growth of SEA outstrip GRAB’s growth projections? Because GRAB actually helps EFFECTUATE the rise in banking, prosperity, and upward mobility. Grab accelerates prosperity in Southeast Asia by connecting people, businesses, and finance through its super-app: It provides steady income to drivers and merchants who once worked informally, digitizing their earnings and making them credit-eligible. Its GrabPay wallet and financial services help millions of unbanked citizens save, borrow, and insure themselves for the first time. By linking small merchants to online customers, Grab expands local business and creates a huge amount of potential for upward mobility. One final thing to address: Many ask, if Grab is so undervalued, why haven’t Institutions stepped in to buy? Why do you think the most successful financial institutions are wrong about $GRAB? Here’s the kicker: $GRAB has over 80% INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP. It’s not the institutions who are wrong, it’s RETAIL. While retail is focused elsewhere, the elites of the financial world are scooping up millions of shares. So I’m buying GRAB before it’s too late. This isn’t financial advice, just my own opinion on the stock and I’ve decided to put my money where my mouth is. I plan to add more and more GRAB shares with every paycheck as well. POSITIONS: GRAB 7C for 12/27: this is the main position, I’m planning to exercise these in a few years. I project GRAB will be above 12 by 2028. Value ~$9,000 GRAB 6-7C 11/14: I’m extremely bullish for earnings, and I think the stock could break past the 6.50s again shortly after. This is a high risk play which I wouldn’t recommend to most. GRAB 6.5-7.5 11/14: Just a $400 lotto ticket for fun GRAB 10-12C 1/21/28: I believe this is the best R/R play for options on GRAB. I plan to buy hundreds more as I build an aggressive position on the stock. At .20 average cost, these have the potential to return almost 900% at expiration.

T,1omm40e,wallstreetbets,Abaxx Technologies: Newest Clearing House and Exchange with Massive Upside,"This is gonna be a longish post. Potential for more than a 50x maybe even +100x but that's extremely hopeful. It has digital identity, digital assets, T+0 settlement, digital gold, tokenized stocks, exchange and clearinghouse. The stock just hit 1 billion USD market cap so I can finally post about it here. **TLDR:** 10x in 1-2 years, 50x within 5 years. New high tech globally recognized and licensed clearinghouse/exchange that is integrating their new digital identity with digital title ownership that has legal finality. Basically merging better tech than CRCL ($30 billion MC) with better tech than CME ($95 billion MC) to unlock a 42 trillion dollar industry. First you have to understand, that commodity clearinghouses and exchanges are worth ALOT of money. Here is all the publicly listed ones. Very few exist. Notice Abaxx at the bottom worth 1 billion. |Clearing|Parent Company|Stock Ticker|Market Capitalization (Nov 2025)| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |CME Clearing|CME Group Inc.|CME (NASDAQ)|\~$93 billion| |LCH.Clearnet|London Stock Exchange Group plc (LSEG)|LSEG.L|\~$49 billion| |ICE Clear (U.S., Europe, etc.)|Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE)|ICE|\~$83 billion| |Hong Kong Securities Clearing|Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX)|[0388.HK](http://0388.HK)|\~$69 billion| |Clearstream|Deutsche Börse AG|[DB1.DE](http://DB1.DE)|\~$47 billion| |Abaxx Clearing|Abaxx Technologies Inc.|ABXX (NEO) / ABXXF (OTCQX)|\~$1 billion| The problem lately is that the big ones have been ignoring industry requests for physically delivered contracts. Now they just launch financially settled contracts which are mostly products for traders not commodity companies which need physical delivery. Also you have LBMA that trades metals like nickel. Remember when LBMA reversed nickel trades for a their Chinese trader because he was caught with his pants down? So industry is ready for another exchange and a clearinghouse that will fix these issues. Many have come to Abaxx for this. Now in comes Abaxx exchange and clearinghouse. Their focus has been physically delivered that are being requested by industry. They have launched LNG, Carbon, Nickel, Lithium, and Gold. LNG and Gold could easily be worth billions each. The others worth hundreds of millions. This is just what they launched so far. They plan to launch much more like weather derivatives likely to come this year still. Abaxx LNG physically delivered contract is already set to replace the financially settled JKM LNG contract (which generates over 100+ million in revenue) as it is better in all aspects due to physically delivered nature. I[n June JKM reported 128,000 lots traded. In November, Abaxx had 9,529 lots traded across its LNG contracts. So already 7.4% of the trading.](https://x.com/James_Duade/status/1984588708444598605) Not a equal comparison month comparison, but just a rough idea. All without US trading firms while Abaxx gets approval to support US clients (CFTC Approval expected after lockdown is over). They are regulated out of Singapore which the US already sees as equivalent, they just need the final sign off. As Abaxx volumes grows, traders will need to trade their LNG out of necessity. As it continues to grow, risk management will require Abaxx LNG physically delivered contracts, again out of necessity. I suspect Abaxx will overtake JKM in 2026 and make it essentially worthless. Abaxx's LNG contracts alone will likely be worth 5-10 billion USD creating a pretty good safety buffer at a 5x from here. Abaxx is also piloting tech with Minehub to let traders us LNG shipments on water as collateral in their futures exchange. This will be expanded out to all their futures markets on success and will also allow traders to use their gold as collateral with much better rates. Their gold futures contract is also gaining traction. They are likely to launch gold spot this month as well with a similar system set up for silver next month. Maybe even this month as well. For those unaware of the gold markets, New York is the futures market and London is the spot market. Which means traders have to physically ship gold bars in a plane to meet delivery. And the gold bars are different sizes (so need a smelter) and in different legal jurisdictions. Abaxx Gold market (and soon silver) will have futures and spot take delivery in the same location, same legal jurisdiction and same gold bar sizes which are also smaller and easier to trade. There is significant efficiencies here which will likely act as a liquidity blackhole for all precious metals markets. **Digital Cheques** Abaxx has announced the pilot launch of their own digital cheques for money market funds that transfer instantly. (I want to avoid that cursed word stable coin because Abaxx has nothing to do with that industry). But Abaxx's tech is better. It’s completely private with legal finality. For those bullish on Circle/Tokenization, just know that banks and companies are never gonna adopt stablecoins on a public ledger that can be all tracked by your favourite three letter agency or competitors. Don't get be even started on counterparty risk of those products. It is a product for retail only. Abaxx exchange and clearing house was built from the ground up with this technology integrated into the exchange. Which means they will use it for instant money transfers and instant T+0 settlement. I can’t emphasize enough what T+0 settlement means for liquidity and trading. It also unlocks the ability for LNG traders to collateralize their trades with gold for example. Nothing more annoying than wanting to trade something but you have to wait several business days for funds to clear or pay interest to get immediate access. The same technology they are also planning to bring to stocks allowing for instant settlement and trading. And if you are paying attention, it’s connected to a regulated clearinghouse and exchange. One of the most regulated customers they will ever have. When they eventually launch a currency trading platform, you can have instant international wire transfers that are routed through a currency exchange to get the current exchange rate and have it instantly settle. None of these $50 wire transfers with awful exchange rates that takes 3 days to arrive in your account. I would dare to say they are building the entire ecosystem needed to bypass the swift network. Think of it like an Apple ecosystem. You use swift to get into it by wiring money to their custodians ([which Abaxx also launched and is using it for their carbon markets](https://x.com/JoshCrumb/status/1964042716083364164) ), but once inside, you have access to instant money transfers, clearinghouse and exchange, stock markets, commodities, and forex. So Abaxx is building the Apple equivalent for the global financial system. Abaxx will also be focusing on bringing 42 Trillion worth of MMFs and Gold to the digital world next year while taking 5 basis points ($21 billion revenue potential) to do so yearly as well as some transaction fees. Obviously they won't get everything. But several of their partners and investors manage already trillions of MMF and appear to like the product. [Their investors control +50% of the MMF funds in USA.](https://x.com/JosephTMetcalf/status/1973059584915898697) **Digital Identity** Okay so behind all their is their ID++ which is their digital identity. It’s all private and encrypted and you use it with the exchange. The Exchange will perform KYC on you and issue credentials. These credentials you use to sign your trades and money transfers. It’s built in a way that you can grant access to portions of it as needed. If you need to sign up for a platform thats needs to KYC you, you grant access to only a certain portion your digital identity on a limited basis. Then you can revoke their access and no longer have access to your documents so you don’t have to be exposed to data hacks on every platform you sign up on. It is built with all the latest digital identity standards like w3 but it's also self sovereign which means you control your identity and its not issued by a government entity. The end goal being is that governments would issue credentials independently to your id and create a ""chain"" of verified credentials. Universities as well for example would issue your grad certificates so you can verify it instantly if someone ever required. But you retain full control of it. The point here isn't so much what it does though, but what it unlocks. Abaxx uses this for their clearing activities and is one of their secret sauces that helps them instantly clear their transactions. **Graded Commodities** Going back to the exchange, Abaxx will also be launching graded commodities. For example different levels of copper grading based on metadata which allows you track carbon emissions or anything else needed. Currently nothing like it exists and will be done through their Minehub partnership. It would prevent electric car companies saying their technology is clean while importing cobalt that was mined from forced labour in Africa. With Abaxx you could get premiums on commodities that were mined cleanly and ethically. Regulations for carbon emissions are also starting to pick up pace. Countries are introducing legislation requiring scope 3 emissions reporting (aka higher up the supply chain). Australia, Brazil, California, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Europe, and USA are all introducing legislation that require commodity supply chain tracking for source of origin, forced labour monitoring, or carbon emissions. This information is not available on current exchanges making them a black box. Abaxx will launch graded versions of these commodities that include metadata that tracks the commodity through its entire supply chain. I could go on but I'll stop it here. I am already at \~4x since i have been buying this stock for a while and just averaging in the entire time. I think it could be $100 billion+ company but the reasoning why would require a second more in depth DD. I can do it if there is enough interest. But based what I said already i think $50 billion is a good limit. If I am right, I see no reason to ever sell this company so I will be holding indefinitely. You can only buy stock on CBOE in Canada, OTC in USA (Sorry robinhood users, get literally any other broker), and on Frankfurt exchange as well. [Cantor just put a price target of $81 CAD on it](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/cantor-fitzgerald-initiates-abaxx-technologies-stock-with-overweight-rating-93CH-4318669). So industry backed 2x if you have less risk tolerance and don't quite yet see the vision. That price target only accounts for exchange angle and doesn't account for their tech which is significantly higher. This stock is forward looking and revenues are just now starting to pick up. Hence the recent surge in stock price. [Here is a in depth video highlighting how it could be worth hundreds of billions. Video is 1hr and 20 min long. ](https://youtu.be/go0bc0K4UdQ?si=LrN3VQdKGw0wwdfW) He runs a family office and he works with the team as sort of a liaison trying to connect sellers with institutions wanting to buy in size so obviously a bit of bias. At the same time though, after having done lots of research myself, you will start to realize that the exchange and clearinghouse (worth tens of billions on its own) is actually just one portion of what they are trying to build. Hence my example of the Apple like ecosystem. Will answer any questions as best I can. **Positions** My current position: 9690 shares. https://preview.redd.it/nryvwb5hbuyf1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f189e838ddaa1c1f1a178e4e08f896514b8aa3 https://preview.redd.it/v5mdto2ibuyf1.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac821e48885005bb91732c18abff9283bbac5295",117,101,2025-11-02 16:42:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1omm40e/abaxx_technologies_newest_clearing_house_and/,2025-11-07 16:42:40.536968,0.5,$T,1.0,[],"['bull', 'rally', 'support', 'volume', 'market cap', 'revenue']",0.9342857142857142,Communication Services
T,1oliks9,ValueInvesting,Fiserv (NYSE: FI) crash gives huge buy opportunity!,"After its brutal Q3-2025 reset (the company’s worst trading day on record), Fiserv’s stock has been priced as if the franchise were in structural decline. The company cut its full-year revenue growth outlook from ~10 % to 3.5–4 % and EPS from $10.20 to about $8.55, triggering its worst trading day on record. From their Q3 call, we understand the last 2 year growth was explained by Argentina and the company was posting a low single digit already ex-Argentina. This explains a large part of the revise guidance. Their SMB business Clover was posting 10% growth till Q3 where it falls to 5% for that quarter. Yet behind the emotional sell-off, the fundamentals of one of the world’s leading payments platforms remain almost intact. A fintech powerhouse in transition. Fiserv operates three strong pillars: (1) Merchant Solutions (Clover for SMBs, Carat for enterprises), (2) Financial Technology for banks and credit unions, and (3) Payments & Network Services covering card processing and digital rails. With more than 10,000 financial-institution clients and millions of merchants, over 80 % of revenue is recurring. The business is mostly software-oriented, and it doesn’t deal with lending or issuing cards. Roughly half of revenue comes from Merchant Acceptance (Clover point-of-sale hardware & software, e-commerce gateways, gift/loyalty programs). First growth engine, Fiserv’s Clover payment-processing platform has been the biggest growth driver, but growth has been slowing down which is one of the attention point. The other half of revenues is Financial-institution technology (core bank-processing, card-issuing platforms, risk and compliance tools, digital-banking apps) Second major growth engine is Fiserv’s DNA platform which remains the leading core system for large credit unions serving over 1,200 credit unions with about 27% market share. Despite some client losses and market share erosion, DNA’s modern, scalable technology and continuous enhancements keep it preferred. Awards in 2024 and major client upgrades, like First Community Credit Union, underline DNA’s strength. And finally, the revenues includes a fast-growing Payments & Network unit (Zelle, debit processing, real-time ACH, prepaid). Because revenue is mostly fee-per-transaction or long-term SaaS contracts, the model is highly recurring and cash-generative. What went wrong in Q3? The reset exposed temporary distortions—Argentina’s hyper-inflation artificially inflated growth, while margin expansion in Merchant stalled. Leadership turnover after Frank Bisignano’s exit deepened uncertainty. But the business itself didn’t collapse; it merely faced a credibility gap. Why it collapse? New management slashed previous full-year earnings guidance (profit warning) and said it won’t be able to deliver on previous promises to investors. Many value investors had entered earlier in Q2 of which big names like Michael Lowenstein, Michael Platt, Seth Klarman, Ray Dalio, and David Shaw which they probably check the long term market position. Why new leadership matters. CEO Mike Lyons, appointed in May 2025, brings a rare mix of banking scale and strategic discipline. Former President of PNC Financial Services and ex-Global Head of Corporate Development at Bank of America, he knows how to integrate platforms and execute through volatility. His “One Fiserv” plan is about: simplifying operations, refocusing on clients and core products, and renewing governance. To my understanding, Fiserv operates a powerful cash machine driven by >80% recurring revenue from core processing (DNA), payments (Clover), and issuer services (Carat). Its sticky, long-term contracts with financial institutions and merchants ensure predictable, high-margin cash flow. Today, it is at the right level of valuation, plus margin of safety due to recent panic. Catalysts ahead. Watch for: (1) early proof of margin stabilization and re-acceleration in Merchant (2) improved investor confidence as leadership executes (3) normalization of Argentine exposure (4) continued buybacks under the 60 million-share authorization. Risks. Execution slippage on the Clover/Carat migration, another guidance cut, or faster innovation by Adyen or Stripe could weigh further. [Add: recession could impact marchand division due to lower expected purchase]. At ~8-9× forward EPS—half the multiple of peers like Visa, Mastercard, or Adyen—Fiserv’s valuation already prices in failure and absence of growth. A rerating to even 12–13× could unlock 50 % upside within 18 months, if margins and confidence normalize. To my view, Fiserv is not (yet) broken, only mispriced after an emotional shock and new reality about their future growth trajectory (-50% in 2 days!). From exuberance to reality. Nice in this current market to pay the right price, even at a good bargain (most probably), aligning more to competitors like FIS and Jack Henry. This seems to be a asymetric bet based on a crisis-level valuation, more chance to get up than to decrease further...unless ......you believe Clover is loosing to competition and their banking solution DNA is doomed to lose its 2,500 customers quickly. My impression after this analysis: Fiserv is trading at materially lower multiples than at the time of the 2019 First Data deal despite a larger, more profitable, less leveraged platform today. Underlying market drivers: 1) Fiserv’s growth is fueled by the expansion of e-commerce and digital payments, which drives higher merchant transaction volumes across its Clover and acquiring platforms. Additionally, the shift from cash to digital in both developed and emerging markets broadens its addressable base. 2) The company leverages this scale to cross-sell analytics, value-added services, and subscription-based solutions, strengthening recurring revenues and customer stickiness. Continued upgrades of POS systems and ISV partnerships enhance product integration and merchant reach, while the global expansion of merchant acquiring deepens geographic diversification. 3) Finally, the digital transformation of banking—through modern core platforms, open-banking APIs, and real-time payment rails—positions Fiserv as a critical enabler of next-generation financial infrastructure. From a value-investor perspective, this re-rating reflects sector de-rating (payments/fintech) and lingering execution skepticism, not fundamentals — suggesting potential re-rating upside if confidence in new management, growth and margin stability returns. Background article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinacastellanos/2025/10/29/fiserv-stock-crashes-44-heres-why/ Update 5th Nov 2025 1) S&P Global Ratings revised Fiserv's outlook from stable to negative, citing potential leverage above 3x, low free cash flow to debt, underinvestment, and unrealistic assumptions https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3473267 2) At least five law firms have filed or announced class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud related to the July 2025 guidance. The company cut its full-year 2025 organic revenue growth guidance from 10% to 3.5%-4% and lowered its EPS outlook.

T,1ocm7oj,ValueInvesting,$FNMA $FMCC IPO DD - Retirement Guide,"WSB banned me for trying to post this. $FNMA $FMCC “F2” “GSEs” “GAMC” FANNIE MAE - FREDDIE MAC DD. TLDR: the ultimate PDJT trade where you can make 10x your money in the next 2 months. If you want in, now is the time, if not, you’ll likely be reading about it later. Full disclosure: I am long both stocks and split the position between the two at 50/50. I and many others have owned these stocks for years knowing the right situation would come along where they unlock massive value for shareholders and the treasury. I will be skipping past a bunch of history that’s important as to how we got here but might not be entirely necessary to understand the investment thesis. Just some key points. FNMA / FMCC securitize and sell MBS, collect a fee, and they guarantee that payments will be made to investors of the MBS. They dominate the market and have virtually no competition. Back in 2008 FNMA FMCC were forced into conservatorship by Hank Paulson and the US Treasury under the threat that their failure would bring down the entire financial system. For those that studied the 2008 GFC more than just watching the big short, the twins aka the GSEs didn’t even need a bail out and Hank Paulson forced it on them. The combined entities received $187bn. Over the next 17 years, they have repaid over $300bn to the treasury but it has not been accounted for. The repayment equates to a ROI of 11% for the treasury. The over arching issue was that President 44 decided to enact the NWS (Net Worth Sweep) against the GSEs forcing them to pass every dollar of profit to the Treasury in the form of a dividend. These dividends/repayments were never deducted /accounted for from the amount loaned to them in 2008. 44 used the NWS and other parts of the GSEs to fund Obamacare. In the last year of 45s first term, he and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin stopped the net worth sweep allowing the twins to retain capital and work towards their capital requirements which once fulfilled allows them to exit conservatorship. The problem, the capital requirements were made to be arbitrarily high, and while the companies started earning and retaining capital, any net profit was now just being added to the value of the treasuries SPS Senior Preferred Stock. In other words, the companies have an approximately 180bn cushion underneath them now but the treasury has an outstanding authority stating that they can take all of it. Plus they own 80% of the common shares by way of penny warrants that they gave themselves for “saving” the GSEs. So today we have two companies that have massive cushions of capital, 65% Market Share, and profits that even the worst financial calamity couldn’t stop (see recent stress tests) The stocks trade at a fraction of their true value due to the overhand of the SPS or the claim that the government could take everything. Which sounds like something they would do, but isn’t what they will do. The stocks have rallied since 47 spoke about campaigning for the 2024 election and have been on a tear ever since he won. Going from Pennies to around 11-12 dollars today. But they aren’t even close to being done. 47 and admin have been dropping bread crumbs all year about their intentions to release the GSEs citing a $1T evaluation for a November stock offering. But the capital structure needs cleaned up, and the capital requirements need to be reset to reflect the most recent stress tests. They can obliterate shareholders of the common stock with the SPS and warrants and own >95%of the companies. Or they can write off the SPS as everybody knows that these two paid back all the money plus much more. The result of writing off the SPS would mean they just roll with their 80% stake via penny warrants and extract value that way by letting the market set the value of their stake. As an 80% stake holder, it makes all the sense in the world to cancel the SPS, and reset the capital requirements to 2.5%. Treasury Secretary Bessent recently in an interview said that he wants long term institutional holders and retail investors, and that all things would be in place for the GSEs success. At a $1T valuation their 80% stake would be worth 800bn. And As reported, They plan to sell 3-6% of their converted warrants to raise $30bn (biggest offering ever) The result would be a remaining stake worth $770bn mark to market, 30bn to the treasury general account (only 47 and Bessent can control) and they would receive 80% of the companies dividend flow (tens of billions per year) They could also loan against their stake to fund additional policy objectives which will help lock down winning the mid terms and other strategic objectives. I and many others see zero reason to obliterate shareholders here as it would result in less economic gain, lawsuits, and a political narrative that is heavily against the admin. They have done a good job of changing the narrative from fear to value as the government takes stakes in companies. This one is the strongest precedent setter yet and is very important to execute properly if they want to have a successful sovereign wealth fund that continue investments in strategic companies. The main characters here are 47, Bessent, Pulte and Lutnick who all bring a lot to the table. These companies have 7T in assets and gush cash. The admin has been talking about calling for a national housing crisis. A private F2 can materially bring down mortgage rates by backstopping the bid on the spread between the 10 yr and the 30 yr MBS, this spread is historically very high and could come down considerably a release from conservatorship. 47 also has been posting about merging them which would only add to their value and efficiencies, and ultimately cheaper mortgages for Americans. Although it’s yet to seen how he is going to accomplish this without congress. More on that later. It’s important to add that none of this requires congress and all the money that could be generated will be in the control of Scott Bessent and 47 by way of the treasury general account. This likely will be the seed capital for the SWF sovereign wealth fund as it was raised in a budget neutral way. The GSEs privatization and stock offering is 47’s ace in his pocket to lower mortgage rates, win mid terms, and finance all the his admin’s objectives (AI race, rare earth investments, digital asset accumulation in Budget neutral way, etc) It’s important to note that equity in mortgages is at a historic all time high and bringing down mortgage rates will cause a refinancing boom that will bring trillions into the economy. As far as home prices are concerned, normally with a lower 10 yr paired with a tighter 10 yr- 30yr MBS spread, you should expect demand to outweigh supply and home prices to rise. This admin obviously doesn’t want that as a result of rate cuts. However we are in an interesting time where manufacture housing is cheaper than the average home for sale. 47 has explicitly stated that GSEs need to get the home builders going and wants a lot supply. If he can jam a bunch of supply into the market at the same time, he can stabilize home prices if not drop them. If home prices drop and energy stays low, I foresee the inflation concerns falling apart as these two segments make up large parts of the inflation calculation and are real difference makers for everyday Americans. So we have memes from 47, interviews with all the main characters supporting this thesis, major investment funds with large stakes waiting for release. This is a deal where everyone can receive a windfall and the treasury can catapult itself forward on a list of admin objectives. A rare opportunity where what’s good for the government, is good for common share investors. I probably missed a bunch as I typed this out but hopefully anyone who read this far can understand the massive value unlock that’s coming. As of today, the capital requirements haven’t been changed and the SPS still remains looming overhead. Howard Lutnick was on recently stating that “listnen a deal will be made” My opinion is that 47 kept the SPS when he cancelled the NWS as a way to keep speculators from front running release knowing that they could get potentially obliterated with dilution. But now we are at the point where the admin is signaling that it will be written off hence why you see the share moving up. Understand that there are 1.2bn share of Fannie Mae alone and I think 600k of Freddie Mac. So all this year leading up to this point has been ups and down coming from news and then no confirmation from the admin. The result is the that 1.2bn shares have been moving from the hands of speculators/traders up 100s of percent to institutional/retail longs. The result will be a very tight float on IPO/uplist day. Bill Ackman is on record stating he owns 200m shares (only 100m reported) and other funds like Morgan Stanley, and capital group have accumulated large amounts as well. These trade and are for now manipulated on the OTC. I believe that under the Wild West veil of the OTC instituons have been able to suppress the price and quietly accumulate But that will soon come to an end when they uplist to NYSE or rumor has it TXSE. 47 has branded them as $GAMC and even teased acquiring the ticker $MAGA. He just put out a new commercial yesterday morning on Fox Business during his interview with Maria Bartiromo. We could do a whole separate post on the growth catalysts that these companies have staged but just know the government has been running them for 17 years and they have been making tons of money as is (approx 35bn a year). They both own 50% of CSS with is the securitization platform that handles all the GSE MBS flow. Pulte has been on record stating that they are changing the CSS to “US FINTECH” which hints that they will license the technology to the rest of the world. $ Imagine what they can do after release from conservatorship with 47, Bessent, Lutnick, and Pulte in charge. Release from conservatorship done right likely will revolutionize housing finance. Let me know what you guys thinks. Just trying to actually throw out a good idea for those who are looking for an opportunity that meets meme stock potential short term and all the value of a long term hold. If you want to learn more go to the FNMA FMCC exit subreddit or even better contact Bill Ackman’s presentation that he release in Jan. (Which he already came back out and said his estimates are too conservative.) Holding forever, but My price target is $50 by Christmas and $100 by end of January. These are two of the biggest companies in the world and still sp500 companies on their worst day.",36,12,2025-10-21 19:19:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ocm7oj/fnma_fmcc_ipo_dd_retirement_guide/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.082679,0.5,$T,0.6,"['FNMA', 'MAGA', 'GAMC', 'FMCC']","['dividend', 'support', 'profit', 'ipo', 'split']",0.9285714285714285,Communication Services
T,1okr3dt,wallstreetbets,"Is it time to switch from Market Cap to Equal Weight 500? My thoughts, really looking to hear yours.","The S&P 500 just posted a new ATH 3 days ago, with nearly 400 of the companies closing in red. These news were disturbing to me. I have always been passive investor, trying to have the least possible number of sales and purchases as possible, to filter out noise, and follow my convictions. This, however, got me thinking. This is not normal, and can't be justified in the eyes of time. I know, I know - ""this time it's different"". Romans thought it too. It's not normal for a single company to have a valuation equal to nearly 1/6th of the GDP of USA. It is NOT normal. It's not sustainable. It does not create 1/6th of the value in the country. People don't eat it, drink it, or live in it. It's products are not 1/6th of your life or used 1/6th of your time. It's not normal for 10 companies to pull the entire index up, while the others are stagnating or declining. I have neither the personal analysis, nor the necessary skillset, or even just the sheer time to make a detailed analysis of the performance of each of the 500, but my conviction, based on my speculation and far-gaze is that the money are flowing in fomo to the hottest potato on the market, and, at least in my mind, there is a doubt, that the red is not based on (just, if any) the poor performance, management or sales of those 490 companies, but rather is capital being redirected to the forerunners, that have more and more ungodly expectations for performance bestowed upon them each new day, and these new and outlandish expectations are already priced in, and being upped with each new hype (Notice I didn't say pump. But really wanted to.) AI. The buzzword. The new hegemon. And don't get me wrong. I see it. I believe in it. I think, no, I am convinced we're on the verge of an Era. And AI is not the Era itself, it's just a corner stone, a building block of it. A big one, maybe the biggest, but not the entire thing. The humanity is on the doorstep of, most probably, the last epoch that we will see slavery again. And this time, we will convince ourselves, as spicies, that this slavery is different (mhm, again). It's not inhumane, because the slaves will be made of metal and circuits. Slaves that don't drink, sleep or eat, that don't have free will, and are, literally, created and programed for whatever we want. ""And it's not inhumane"" humanity will cheer. Anybody played Detroit:Become Human? That's what happens after. But while we get to the Detroit scenario, imagine the progress. Imagine being able to create a factory, that builds cars, or toys, or whatever your heart desires, filled with workers, that costed you a one time payment of a price, equal to around one-year salary for a human worker. And that factory works 24/7, with no recurring costs, other than maintenance and utilities. It's happening. Right now. But it's happening slow. Slower than we wish, slower than we hope, and more diversified, than we can imagine. Or at least than I can imagine. Maybe you're better than me. And it's not a single company, that will do it. Remember Cisco ($NASDAQ:CSCO)? They were gonna run the internet themselves. 25 years later, they're still below their ATH. It's the world, that's gonna do it. The companies that are producing the best examples are still not even public yet (Yes, I'm looking at you, Figure8). We have extreme expectations, priced in in a handful of companies. Behemots of industry, with uber-large staffing, rigid framework and heavy beaurocratic procedures, because this is what happens when you're a behemot of industry. It's how the world turns, ever since the Romans, because it's just how it works, if you want to command a large structure. And large and rigid structures are slow. Slow to innovate, slow to adapt, slow to move, because they are large. Swans and innovation come from small, nimble and adaptive organisms, because they can leap like no one else. And when someone strikes the gold vein, and skyrokets, they stop innovating, and start building rigidity, predictability and dependability. At least in my view, that is. What is my thesis? This concentartion is not sustainable. Those valuations are outlandish, and those promises and expecations are unkeepable. It's not normal, and it should bother you. It should bother all of us. Eggs in one basket, ever heard the telling? The world is more than AI or robotics, and that's coming from me, and I am heavily invested in tech. And sooner or later, the world is gonna have a sobering slap and remember it. I don't know when it's gonna be, but my speculation is that it will start with broken promises. Lack of adoption or enougu real world applications, that will make the doubts creep in under the itchy skin of Mr. Market. And then, oh my. Saying all of that, I am here to actually ask a question. These news were bothering to me, and got me thinking: Isn't it prudent to sell the winners and buy the underdogs when they're undervalued? Sounds 'bout right to me. I did a bit of research with Perplexity AI (hehe, the irony, eh?), and then double checked, and it turns out, historically Equal Weight 500 was beating Market Weight, by a good margin (+3-4% annually, IIRC). Last 10 years are a different story though. And now, we have the biggest, visible divergence of the two, widening the gap visually on the chart, from 2014 until now. I am quoting 2014 because this is the starting point of the ETF I am looking at: $XETR:XDEW . Currently, I hold my S&P position entirely in $XETR:SXR8 . https://preview.redd.it/qkcphsjdefyf1.png?width=3202&format=png&auto=webp&s=407ef7f7d68b9b5c9c72948d855f4e94fcfdf3dd I am thinking... Should I switch from $XETR:SXR8 to $XETR:XDEW and bet on mean reversion? Perplexity told me I'm right, but to be fair, would you believe a slave's praise to it's master? I wouldn't. Strategy is to track conecntration and breadth, and hold $XETR:XDEW while the capital within the 500 restructures, and then switch to market cap again, once the dust has settled, and the hangover from the sobering up has passed. I am really eager to hear opinions on this. I am not sure about it. I am sure about the part that's not normal, but I am not sure on what's the best strategy to deal with it, and as passively as possible. I am not convinced that I want to be the dumb roommate and miss the party too. So... That's my 5 cents :) Looking for yours",55,106,2025-10-31 10:38:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1okr3dt/is_it_time_to_switch_from_market_cap_to_equal/,2025-11-07 16:42:40.541753,0.5,$T,1.0,['XETR'],"['rally', 'market cap']",0.9114285714285714,Communication Services
T,1ogonw5,investing,Help me understand why I shouldn't sell my long term rental and just sell covered calls on SPY,"\*\*reposting here since it was deleted from r/realestateinvesting Have had a rental home operating for a little under 10 years. It is a 2 bed/1bath at 1200 square feet in what I would call a B- neighborhood. The home had a 15 year mortgage taken out in 2012 and has about $15k in principle left. Rental income is currently at $1495/month. averaging the various online real estate sites and looking at recent sales I'd estimate the current sales value at around $225k. The roof, HVAC, and fence are all less than 5 years old, so if we do continue to rent, we should be clear of any large CAPEX items for several years. When we pay off the home in 2027, assuming we are still at $1495 per month, after taxes and insurance it comes out to $977 (again, assuming T&I doesnt keep rising at a ridiculous rate). Accounting for management, vacancy, repairs and future CAPEX I am calculating around $560 per month. Assuming 2% annual appreciation, that adds another $375/month (first year) for a total of $960/month. If I were to sell the home today at the $225k, after realtor fees, depreciation recapture, taxes, mortgage pay off, capital gains, minor repairs etc, I am coming up with around $175k in cash. Now for my theory: say I take this $175k and add some savings to get to $203k so I can buy 300 shares of SPY at its current trading price of $677. Tracking this for a bit, I can sell 0.25 delta covered calls that are one week out for around $1.75 each. This would put the gross income at $525/week, not accounting for any appreciation. I don't need to show the math to prove that this comes out to higher than the $960/month from my rental. two outcomes of this weekly position: 1. SPY increases past my strike. I roll the option into the following week, profit is locked up in the sell/buy but still a net increase. 2. SPY trades below my strike by whatever amount and I just keep the premium. There are of course pros and cons to both options. An obvious risk to point out with the CC option is that the market could plummet at any point and my $200k could fall to $100k or lower. If, in theory, I do not plan to cash out this position and spend it anytime within the next couple decades (similar to holding the cash in the rental equity) I'm not concerned over that other than the income from the premiums would shrink as well. There are also obvious cons to the rental that are not captured in the $960 above as well. A bad tenant, liability, extended vacancy, reduction in rent (probably tied to the market 'crash' scenario above) all could impact the profitability. I have also looked into selling this property or pulling a HELOC to buy other rentals. At the current values and interest rates I just can't get any properties I come across to make sense at all. I am open to other suggestions or pointing out of pitfalls or other details I am not considering.

T,1oq4p23,wallstreetbets,"$RENT - PE Sharks Circle the Runway: Thin Float, Take-Private Setup, 4X Special Situation","In for $100k TL;DR: Rent the Runway ($RENT)(RTR), a subscription fashion rental firm recently de-risked after an Oct 2025 recap ($223 M swap, ~33 M shares, PE trio ~86%). Now $4 stock ripe for take-private. PE could lowball $6–8 above market- a steal! - yet fair value sits ~$15–18 (~4× upside) and barely dents their IRR. Market just needs to wake up and re-rate. This isn’t a long-term bullish thesis on RTR’s success- it’s a structural read. Ownership, recap terms, and incentives indicate a likely take-private situation; the focus is ensuring holders receive fair value. DYOR, not advice. ********************* Quick Biz Summary and RTR History: Rent the Runway (RTR), founded in 2009 by Jennifer Hyman (still CEO), lets women rent designer clothing through a subscription “closet in the cloud.” It went public in 2021 at $21/share, reaching a peak valuation above $1 billion before COVID aftershocks and mounting debt derailed growth. The company later pivoted to resale and brand rev-share partnerships with a sustainability angle. Revenue is about $300 million, profitability returned in 2024, and following the October 2025 recap, RTR now trades around a $130 million market cap (~$250 million enterprise value)- a fraction of its IPO-era value. What Just Happened- The Restructuring Bombshell: On October 28, 2025, Rent the Runway completed a major recapitalization led by private equity firm APS, its largest lender. The deal converted $223 million of debt into equity at $9.23 per share and added $20 million in new cash. Debt dropped to about $120 million, with maturity extended to 2029. The share count ballooned from roughly 4 million to 33.4 million, creating heavy dilution. The PE trio—APS, STORY3, and Nexus—now controls about 86% of the company (roughly 29 million shares). The board was restructured with their appointees, and ownership rights tied to control thresholds. That leaves just 4.8 million shares in the public float—financially de-risked but thinly traded, positioning it for a swift re-rate once visibility improves. What PE Players See- 2024 Wins, 2025 Investments, Growth Guidance: This isn’t about RTR’s long-term success, but about how PE values the setup. In 2024, the company finally pivoted to profitability- roughly $47 million in adjusted EBITDA (15% margin), $13 million in operating cash flow, and subscriptions up 13% year over year in Q2. The soft revenue and margin dips in early 2025 (about –7%) seem deliberate, tied to increased spending on inventory, brand partnerships, and marketing to re-accelerate growth. Subscriptions reached record highs (+1% YoY in Q1), with management guiding to 10%+ growth for the full year (!). From a PE lens, RTR now looks like a stabilized, cash-generating platform with minimal near-term credit risk- ideal conditions for a controlled take-private. Why This Screams Take-Private: With ~86% control, a thin float, and a cleaned-up balance sheet, this is a textbook private-equity setup for a take-private. Once the group crosses Delaware’s 90% ownership threshold, it can execute a short-form merger- no shareholder vote required. Minority holders are converted to cash at a price set by the board, with only limited “appraisal rights.” In practice, those challenges are rare and costly, meaning control effectively sets the price. Buying the remaining ~14% public float at an $8 lowball would cost about $39 million- pocket change. Even paying a fair $15–18 per share would cost roughly $73–87 million, still well within reach and only trimming a few points off a 25–30% IRR on a $500–600 million exit in three to five years. The structure and incentives align perfectly: private equity holds the cards, the balance sheet is de-risked, and the public float is small enough to take out quietly. The only variable is visibility—if the market stays asleep, retail gets cashed out cheap; if not, PE has to pay fair value. Valuation model check: RTR’s 2024 turnaround base case: ~$47 million in adjusted EBITDA on ~$300 million revenue, ~$120 million net debt post-recap, and ~33.4 million diluted shares outstanding. At a conservative 10–12× EV/EBITDA (roughly in line with profitable consumer-subscription peers) the equity screens at $10–14 per share. A modest re-rate to 13–14× for growth visibility and balance-sheet strength lands at $15–18 per share. That’s the range private equity would model for a clean take-private: full control, de-risked balance sheet, and still a 25–30% IRR on a $500–600 million re-IPO or sale. Paying fair here for the remaining 14% of float doesn’t hurt them it actually strengthens their exit story, giving them a higher private mark to re-IPO against. At take-private pricing: Exit Multiple | Enterprise Value Less Net Debt | Equity Value Per-Share 10× EBITDA | ~$470M–$120M=~$350M | ~$10/share 11× EBITDA | ~$520M–$120M=~$400M | ~$12/share 12× EBITDA | ~$564M–$120M=~$444M | ~$13–14/share 13× EBITDA | ~$610M–$120M=~$490M |~$15–16/share 14× EBITDA | ~$658M–$120M=~$538M |~$17–18/share What’s Attractive for Each PE Firm: APS (Aranda Principal Strategies)- Lead lender turned majority owner (~60% stake). Entered at $9.23/share via debt-to-equity conversion. Credit-focused, targeting a 1.1–1.6× return ($10–15/share exit) for a 15–25% IRR over 2–4 years. Likely to push a take-private, then sell its stake to STORY3/Nexus once control is secured. STORY3 Capital Partners- Consumer-focused investor (~13% stake), entered around $4.08/share. Sees brand and subscription revival potential, aiming for 3–6× upside ($15–26/share) and 25–40% IRR over a 4–7 year horizon. Positioned to buy APS’s stake and drive the eventual re-IPO or sale. Nexus Capital Management- Special-situations investor (~13% stake), also entered near $4.08/share. Targets 2.5–5× return ($10–22/share) and 20–35% IRR, focused on operational leverage and logistics optimization. Likely co-buyer of APS’s position alongside STORY3. Collectively, the trio has invested over $240 million, signaling long-term conviction. Offloading shares into the thin float would crater their own value and control, so they’re here for rebuild IRRs, not short-term flips. Even at $15–18 per share, STORY3 and Nexus gain little by selling- liquidity is limited, and exiting early would jeopardize their governance rights and 90% control path. Their real upside comes from taking RTR private, scaling it quietly, and re-listing later at a far higher valuation. Final thoughts: The setup here is simple: PE owns 86%, the balance sheet is clean, and the float is microscopic. The next logical move is a take-private once they cross Delaware’s 90% threshold. The math works either way: an $8 squeeze-out costs them pocket change, while paying fair value at $15–18 barely moves their IRR and strengthens their re-IPO optics later. Retail doesn’t need to bet on Rent the Runway’s long-term success to see the angle. This is a structure-driven opportunity: a thin-float, de-risked special situation where visibility alone can change the outcome. Don’t let PE Delaware-90% you out at $8 “premium” peanuts. A $15–18 fair-value buyout cost is immaterial (maybe a 1–2% IRR drag). Make them pay fair. Stop the steal. (PS- $15–18 is a reasonable premium for PE to own the upside cleanly. But with a float this thin, if sentiment turns or things get a little memey… well, it could make for quite a story #sundressSZN) ********************* Key references: https://investors.renttherunway.com/news-releases/news-release-details/rent-runway-announces-growth-recapitalization-and-strategy https://renttherunway.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/rent-runway-announces-closing-recapitalization-transactions https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Rent-the-runway-to-swap-debt-for-equity-in-revival-effort,1757372.html https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468327/000095010325010546/dp233293_8k.htm",12,6,2025-11-06 17:11:41,https://i.redd.it/bi1kfop16ozf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:42:40.522825,0.5,$T,1.0,['RENT'],"['bull', 'squeeze', 'dip', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'merger', 'ipo']",0.8457142857142856,Communication Services

T,1oo8qx2,stocks,Yum! Brands strategic review of Pizza Hut. Could they sell it and buy Wendy’s instead?,"So Yum! Brands ($YUM) said today they’re doing a “strategic review” of Pizza Hut, which usually means they might sell it, spin it off, or make some big changes. That got me thinking: what if Yum actually sells Pizza Hut and goes after Wendy’s ($WEN) instead? Why it kind of makes sense Pizza Hut has been struggling for years with flat sales, fading relevance, and too many outdated dine-in stores. Meanwhile, Taco Bell under the same umbrella keeps crushing it. Yum even hinted that Pizza Hut might be better off outside the portfolio. Wendy’s looks undervalued right now. Their “Project Fresh” turnaround is in progress, but the market hasn’t really priced in much optimism yet. There’s also the Greg Creed connection. He used to be the CEO of Taco Bell and Yum, and now he’s consulting for Wendy’s. That’s an interesting overlap. From a strategic standpoint, Yum doesn’t have a burger brand. Adding Wendy’s would give them one and put them head to head with Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons. Yum also has a strong history of turning around struggling brands and expanding them through franchising. They could probably scale Wendy’s faster than Wendy’s could do alone. Why it could backfire There’s a big execution risk. The burger space is crowded, and Wendy’s has had mixed results before. Integrating a company like Wendy’s could be messy, with different cultures, systems, and brand identities. Regulators might not love the idea of more consolidation in the fast food space. Yum could always decide to use the money elsewhere, like investing more in Taco Bell, digital ordering, or delivery growth instead of making a big acquisition. My take If Yum wants to diversify and add a new growth driver, trading Pizza Hut for Wendy’s actually makes sense. They’d get a major burger brand, stronger U.S. presence, and a brand that could benefit from Yum’s global franchising model. On the other hand, if Wendy’s successfully executes its turnaround on its own, Yum might regret not moving sooner while the valuation is still low. Either way, this Pizza Hut review feels like the start of something bigger. What do you all think? Would Yum actually do something like this? Is Wendy’s a realistic target or just wishful thinking? How would you play it if there’s even a chance something like this happens? TL;DR: Yum is reviewing Pizza Hut. If they sell it, buying Wendy’s could make sense given the Greg Creed connection, the undervalued stock, and Yum’s track record with turnarounds. It could be crazy or it could be brilliant.",15,25,2025-11-04 14:34:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oo8qx2/yum_brands_strategic_review_of_pizza_hut_could/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.797365,0.5,$T,0.9,"['WEN', 'YUM']","['eps', 'acquisition']",0.8114285714285714,Communication Services
T,1olduzu,investing,"Nvidia Forges Major South Korea Partnership, Supplying 260,000 AI Chips as CEO Huang Expresses Hope for China Market Access","Nvidia announced landmark agreements with South Korea’s government and major corporations including Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor Group, and SK Group to supply over 260,000 advanced AI chips, marking what analysts called a watershed moment for the company’s global expansion. The deals include Samsung building an AI factory with 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to automate chip manufacturing, with Samsung also in talks to supply next-generation HBM4 memory chips to Nvidia. Hyundai will deploy Blackwell GPUs for AI-driven mobility solutions as part of a $3 billion AI cluster initiative. CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in Seoul, expressed optimism over eventually selling Blackwell chips to China while acknowledging the decision rests with President Trump. Huang characterized China as an irreplaceable market representing a $50 billion opportunity this year and potentially hundreds of billions by decade’s end, though he noted the company is hoping for non-zero market share while expecting zero. He downplayed national security concerns, stating China produces plenty of AI chips domestically and has blocked Nvidia’s H20 chips, suggesting China doesn’t want U.S. chips for security reasons. The South Korea deal came as Nvidia crossed the $5 trillion market valuation threshold, becoming the first company to reach that milestone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $240, maintaining a buy rating and expecting another beat-and-raise quarter. Huang acknowledged the company faces challenges in high-bandwidth memory supply but expressed confidence both Korean suppliers will succeed with HBM4 production. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives characterized the South Korean partnerships as a watershed moment for Nvidia’s international AI infrastructure buildout.

T,1opepxs,ValueInvesting,PROCORE Technologies - The Stock Nobody is Talking About,"Despite commanding a $10.7B market cap, managing 3M+ projects globally, and booking $1.15B in annual revenue (+21% YoY), Procore occupies minimal mindshare in mainstream equity research and retail investor discourse. This invisibility persists despite three material catalysts (AWS partnership, CEO transition, AI suite launch) converging simultaneously before November 5, 2025 earnings. The construction software category lacks the narrative magnetism of AI pure-plays, cloud infrastructure, or semiconductor names—leaving PCOR trading at 7.7× forward P/S despite 13-15% revenue growth and margin inflection occurring in real-time. THE OVERLOOKED BUSINESS MODEL Recursive Revenue Expansion: Unlike per-seat SaaS pricing, Procore charges per project stakeholder. A single construction project generates revenue from owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, engineers, and architects—each becoming autonomous revenue streams without incremental per-user fees. This structure creates network effects invisible to spreadsheet analysts who benchmark against Salesforce or ServiceNow pricing models. Switching Costs Built Into Architecture: 500+ integrations with accounting, scheduling, and document management software create operational lock-in. Customers cannot migrate without rebuilding entire workflows. This durability explains 95% gross revenue retention (up 100 bps YoY) despite construction industry cyclicality and macro headwinds. Untapped Geographic Expansion: U.S. represents 60-65% of revenue. Europe, Asia-Pacific, and emerging markets remain under-penetrated relative to addressable market size—a growth vector completely absent from consensus estimates and sell-side models. THE CATALYSTS WALL STREET MISSED AWS Strategic Collaboration (August 26, 2025): Procore now accessible via AWS Marketplace across North America and Europe. Amazon Bedrock LLM integration enables AI-powered document analytics, task automation, and workflow intelligence. This partnership doubles addressable market by bundling Procore with AWS’s massive enterprise customer base. Yet Wall Street largely ignored the announcement. Few analysts revised customer acquisition assumptions upward. Proven CEO Leadership (September 22, 2025): Dr. Ajei Gopal (effective November 10) tripled Ansys revenue and quadrupled market value, culminating in a $35B Synopsys acquisition. His appointment signals board confidence in enterprise-scale growth trajectory. Founder Tooey Courtemanche remains as Chairman, eliminating succession risk. This pedigree should command 15-20% valuation premium; instead, PCOR trades modestly above August lows. Groundbreak AI Innovations (October 15, 2025): Procore Assist with Photo AI, Agent Builder (custom workflow automation), and multilingual support directly address construction’s 300K+ unfilled labor shortage. These features accelerate document processing from days to seconds and amplify customer lifetime value. Zero upgrade cycle reflected in current guidance, creating Q4 2025 and FY2026 upside surprise vectors. Q2 2025 Earnings Beat Pattern: Non-GAAP EPS beat by 191.67% ($0.11 above consensus). Revenue beat by 3.9%. Management exhibits consistent pattern of exceeding Street expectations, yet consensus has not incorporated beat probability into Q3 estimates. MARKET STRUCTURE AMPLIFYING INVISIBILITY Analyst Coverage Gap: Construction software receives 1/3 the coverage depth of horizontal SaaS platforms. Procore has 18-22 analysts vs. 60+ for Salesforce or ServiceNow. This creates information asymmetry—meaningful updates circulate within specialized audiences but miss generalist fund managers. Sector Rotation Headwinds: Construction remains economically sensitive. Rising mortgage rates (+50 bps to 5%+), housing starts declining 6.7% YoY, and tariff uncertainty create macro overhang sentiment. Investors reflexively de-rate construction exposures without distinguishing software (high-margin, recession-resistant) from hardware/services (cyclical). Short Interest as Contrarian Signal: 11.73M shares short (10.21% of float, 6.7-8.4 days to cover) increased 13.11% entering earnings. Shorts are actively positioning for disappointment—a contrarian setup that explodes if fundamentals prove resilient. STRUCTURAL RISKS (PRICED IN) 1. Residential Construction Weakness – Housing starts at 1.31M units (-6.7% YoY); mortgage rates elevated. However, commercial, infrastructure, and data center segments accelerating, providing offset. 2. Revenue Growth Deceleration – 25.9% (Q1 2024) → 14.0% (Q2 2025) trend reflects scale normalization, not demand destruction. Q3 guidance at +10.5% growth still exceeds S&P 500 average. 3. Profitability Sustainability Questions – Non-GAAP margins expanding through cost discipline. GAAP profitability remains negative (-$0.14 EPS Q2). Investors skeptical margin expansion persists if R&D accelerates for AI/international initiatives. 4. Integration Execution Risk – Novorender acquisition ($44.3M, Jan 2025), AWS partnership integration, new CEO onboarding (Nov 10) create near-term operational complexity. Any misstep post-earnings triggers sharp reversal. VALUATION: INVISIBLE BUT NOT CHEAP At $71.54, PCOR trades 7.7× forward P/S and 8.1× Enterprise Value / RPO. This represents a discount-to-growth multiple—lower than SaaS peers (10-12×) despite superior retention (95%), margin trajectory (+423 bps inflection), and partnership catalysts (AWS). Consensus price targets average $81.95 (+14.18%), yet this assumes incremental 15-20% earnings beats must occur to justify upside. Current valuation reflects priced-in skepticism rather than fundamental challenge. THE EARNINGS INFLECTION MOMENT November 5, 2025 Earnings: Q3 expectations are revenue $327.44M (+10.5% YoY) and EPS $0.31 (vs -$0.18 loss in Q3 2024). This represents a $0.49 earnings swing—a magnitude that historically triggers 8-12% single-day moves in software names. Procore’s lack of media coverage means beat surprise will reverberate through short-covering dynamics (11.73M shares exposed) rather than broad institutional FOMO.

T,1odpaqs,ValueInvesting,Netflix ($NFLX) Crashes 10% After Earnings Miss. Time to Buy the Dip?,"Netflix ($NFLX) shares plunged more than 10% today, marking the company’s worst session since April 2022. The sell-off followed a Q3 earnings miss, weaker-than-expected guidance, and renewed concerns over global trade tensions. Yet while traders fled, several analysts and institutional investors expressing a possible entry point in one of the market’s most resilient companies. **Timeline of Today’s Events:** * **10:31 AM** – Investingcom reports Wall Street opens lower as investors digest mixed earnings; Netflix leads declines after missing expectations. * **10:35 AM** – Reuters notes the S&P 500 ticks lower as Netflix drops sharply, dragging the tech sector. * **10:40 AM** – Barron’s lists Netflix among the top market movers alongside Tesla and Texas Instruments, following its earnings disappointment. * **10:45 AM** – Marketbeat confirms Netflix shares gap down after Q3 EPS of **$5.87 vs. $6.96 expected**, citing a Brazil tax dispute that hit margins. * **10:47 AM** – CNBC reports Netflix won’t pursue a Warner Bros.

Is This Your Chance to Buy?” raising early debate over whether the dip is justified. * **11:13 AM** – YouTube Finance clip from Loop Capital’s Alan Gould reiterates Netflix’s disciplined approach and rules out major acquisitions. * **11:23 AM** – Citi analyst Jason Bazinet calls the sell-off “**overdone**,” arguing Netflix’s long-term earnings power remains intact. * **11:27 AM** – The Fly reports Needham maintains a **Buy** on $NFLX, and UBS reiterates a **21% upside target** from current levels. * **11:30 AM** – Yahoo Finance notes: “Earnings live: Netflix dives, Hilton rises as Tesla earnings loom.” Broader markets weaken in sympathy. * **12:32 PM** – Seeking Alpha reports: “Wall Street drifts lower on Netflix’s slide,” confirming Netflix’s move as the key drag on the Nasdaq. * **1:45 PM** – Reuters adds: “Wall Street stumbles on Netflix results, revived U.S.–China trade tensions,” amplifying the macro-driven sell-off narrative. * **2:24 PM** – Investingcom highlights gold extending losses as equities weaken on “Netflix disappointment.” * **3:10 PM** – Market Rebels notes $NFLX down 8% intraday, with option traders citing elevated put volume tied to post-earnings positioning. * **3:17 PM** – Bloomberg includes Netflix among top decliners in its “Stock Movers” segment. * **4:00 PM** – Bloomberg Businessweek Daily headline: “Netflix Earnings Worry, Google–Anthropic Deal Talk,” confirming broader tech-sector unease. * **4:59 PM** – MarketFlux headline reads: “U.S. Markets Tumble on Netflix Disappointment,” linking the drop to renewed trade and earnings fears. * **5:18 PM** – Investingcom reiterates: “Stocks ease as Netflix falls; gold extends Tuesday’s decline,” citing the streamer’s miss as a risk-off trigger. * **5:54 PM** – Marketbeat posts: “Netflix Trading Down 10.1% Following Weak Earnings,” confirming the official close. * **7:02 PM** – Neilksethi (X) notes: “Worst day for Netflix (-10.1%) since April ’22.” * **7:57 PM** – Seeking Alpha upgrades coverage with: “Netflix: There’s Opportunity To Wade Into This Correction,” calling it a compelling re-entry point. * **8:08 PM** – CNBC’s Jim Cramer declares, “Netflix’s earnings don’t shake my faith—it’s a good buying opportunity.” This sell-off looks less like a structural collapse and more like a market overreaction. Netflix remains a free cash flow machine, generating over $6 billion annually with expanding advertising revenue and steady global subscriber growth near 290 million. Even after the correction, Netflix commands strong pricing power, an unmatched content library, and a growing AI-enabled production edge that could drive margin expansion. Trading near 27× forward earnings, the valuation now looks reasonable for a company with this scale, moat, and cash profile. This pullback feels like 2022 all over again, we have some pessimism in the headlines, but fundamentals of the company are strong and present a nice value play.",2,31,2025-10-23 00:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1odpaqs/netflix_nflx_crashes_10_after_earnings_miss_time/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.075665,0.5,$T,0.6,['NFLX'],"['calls', 'earnings', 'dip', 'volume', 'revenue', 'loss', 'eps', 'acquisition']",0.7457142857142857,Communication Services
T,1o2pvyd,ValueInvesting,"Cellebrite ($CLBT): Deep Moat, Durable Compounder, Discounted Multiple","I think Cellebrite (NASDAQ: CLBT) is an interesting opportunity Key Stats * 4.6B Market Cap * 52W High: $26.3, 52W Low: $13.10 * 20%+ YoY Revenue Growth * 7.9x EV/Revenue, 37x P/E * \~0% Debt **Elevator Pitch** This is a high quality, mission-critical software company with an impenetrable public-sector moat and dominant share in digital investigations. Rising case backlogs are forcing agencies to expand their use of its tools, and no credible alternative exists, leaving Cellebrite poised to win. With short-term fears driving a temporary discount and imminent near-term catalysts, there’s clear asymmetric upside. **Business & Industry Overview** Known for its phone-hacking tools, Cellebrite first gained attention after the 2016 San Bernardino case, when its tech helped the FBI bypass iPhone encryption. When Trump was nearly assassinated in July 2024, Cellebrite’s software cracked the shooter’s phone within 40 minutes. They lead a duopoly in digital forensics with a first-mover advantage, high switching costs, latent pricing power, and strong cash generation. Shares are down \~30% (2–3x multiple compression) from 52-week highs amid temporary fears—federal budget noise, management changes, and exaggerated competition worries. These are transient, not structural. Cellebrite remains the backbone of global digital investigations—nobody ever got fired for buying Cellebrite. Cellebrite provides mission-critical digital forensics software to law enforcement, evolving from device extraction to a full-stack forensics workflow—unlocking, extracting, analyzing, and sharing device data as court-admissible evidence. Top-Line Breakdown 1. Digital Forensics Suite (80%) – Legacy UFED + Physical Analyzer bundle for extraction and analysis. Cellebrite is now upgrading users to Inseyets, a premium cloud-based suite integrating UFED/PA with features like Automation, Triage, and Quick View. 2. New Products (10%) – Guardian (cloud evidence management) and Pathfinder (multi-device analytics), both nearly doubling YoY. 3. Professional Services (10%) – Training and integration support. Cellebrite serves 7K+ customers—90% public sector—across local, state, federal, and international agencies. The U.S. drives 52% of revenue; Europe/APAC make up the rest. Financially elite: 20–25% ARR growth, 85% gross margins, 26% FCF margins, 20+ quarters of 120%+ NRR, $500M cash, and no debt—making it a “Rule of 45” software company. Digital forensics is a $15B market growing 15% CAGR. Roughly 90% of cases involve digital evidence, and rising case complexity and backlogs are structurally increasing demand for Cellebrite’s software. **Thesis #1 — Growth Algorithm** *TL;DR*: Bears argue Cellebrite’s growth is capped due to full penetration; bulls see a large untapped opportunity to expand usage within existing agencies that urgently need more tools. \-- The central question is whether Cellebrite’s growth can persist. Bears note near-full logo penetration—50/50 U.S. states, 20/20 top police departments, 27/27 EU members, and 9/10 top tech firms—arguing growth from upselling existing clients will fade as ARR growth normalizes below 20%. 2025 headwinds reinforced that narrative: DOGE budget confusion caused contract delays and soft guidance, the founder/CEO exited after 20 years, and churn temporarily rose to \~9% (mostly from terminating misuse-prone customers). Many mistook these transitory issues for structural decline. Bulls counter that while Cellebrite has reached peak breadth, it remains far from peak depth. Penetration within agencies is only 5–8%. Nearly every case involves digital evidence, yet only a small fraction of agents have access to Cellebrite tools—creating significant latent demand. In my conversations with customers, I found that agents routinely **shared devices**, sometimes driving hours between departments and delaying investigations from one month to a year. This backlog highlights a major supply-demand imbalance. The company is actively expanding by doing two things. First, they are selling *more licenses* to Digital Forensics Units (DFU) and upgrading customers to increase their allotted consumption of Cellebrite cloud products. Second, they are expanding to Investigative Units (IU). In law enforcement, the DFUs specialize in digital forensics analysis and investigation. Now, IUs work on prosecution and investigative cases writ large: they do the heavy work for the rest of the case-building and analysis. But, when a component of the investigation requires a digital analysis, they ship it off to the DFU. Now, each DFU serves \~13 independent IU’s: the agents at normal branches will ship off whatever DFU serves their branch. This dynamic is now changing: Cellebrite is now directly selling technology to IUs so they can triage devices and help speed up the process, eliminating the need to wait on DFUs to get back to them on current cases. This way, IUs can quickly assess the surface level of a digital case, and if need be, they can send it to the digital DFU lab for further investigation—Cellebrite sells more devices, backlogs will go down, and agencies can process more cases faster. It’s a win-win for everyone involved, and it’s only a matter of time before those sales are made. The thesis here is simple: backlogs are exploding, agencies are stretched, and Cellebrite is the only trusted vendor. The technology is mission-critical, and expanding licenses is inevitable. Even small increases in adoption per agency materially compound ARR. Growth can triple within a few years as agencies expand usage to meet investigative demand. **Thesis #2 — FedRAMP** TL;DR: The market is missing the forest for the trees on imminent FedRAMP authorization. It will expand Cellebrite’s ability to sell cloud products across the public sector. While consensus focuses on federal upside (\~20% of revenue), the larger opportunity lies in downstream state and local adoption (\~80%). \-- Cellebrite is expanding beyond phone unlocking into full-chain forensics—helping law enforcement access, analyze, and store data securely. Its Inseyets, Guardian, and Pathfinder products are cloud-based and command premium pricing with strong ROI by automating manual and paper-heavy workflows. Today, most digital investigations remain off-cloud due to strict Chain of Custody requirements. Agencies still rely on USBs and physical files, unable to migrate workflows due to regulatory barriers. Cellebrite’s local tools (UFED/PA) have long satisfied these rules but lack cloud efficiency. FedRAMP approval changes this. FedRAMP—the federal government’s cloud security certification—allows vendors to sell cloud software to agencies with stringent clearance needs. Federal customers (\~20% of Cellebrite’s base) await authorization, which began in March 2024 and is expected within two quarters. The direct federal revenue uplift could be $50–150M, with sell-side estimates ranging $20–80M. But the larger opportunity is sub-federal diffusion. Historically, once the federal government certifies a technology, state and local agencies follow rapidly. “If it’s safe for the feds, it’s safe for us.” After Zoom’s 2019 FedRAMP approval, for instance, adoption surged across local agencies, who can fast-track funding for federally cleared tools. **This is much larger opportunity for seat expansion** because of how much wider the customer base is. State and local agencies—80% of Cellebrite’s base—face tight budgets but stand to benefit most from cloud migration. FedRAMP removes the security barrier, and growing digital backlogs ensure eventual adoption. Timing is uncertain, but directionally inevitable. I estimate +$110M in ARR from sub-federal cloud adoption alone, excluding federal uplift. **Potential PE Sale** While speculative, Cellebrite is a prime private equity acquisition candidate given its sticky recurring revenue, high margins, and cash generation. With peers increasingly privatized, Cellebrite could be next. SunCorp owns 50% of the company, and potential buyers include Axon, Motorola, and Vista. Axon already holds a 5% stake, and its ecosystem synergies with Cellebrite are strong despite non-overlapping offerings. The SPAC sponsor True Wind holds 20% of SunCorp and has an earnout at $30/share expiring August 2026, implying a target acquisition benchmark. The newly appointed CFO has a history of preparing companies for sale—further aligning incentives toward a transaction. There has been increasing activist pressure within SunCorp to sell the business **Risks & Mitigants** 1. iOS Vulnerability Concerns – A 2024 leak claimed Cellebrite couldn’t access iOS 17, raising fears of share loss to Magnet. I got on the phone with a security research expert, and found that these fears were misplaced. Even if the company fails to crack the software, vulnerabilities still exist at the hardware and firmware level. Enforcement agencies can still bypass those levels depending on the OS—for example, baseband exploits, boot ROM exploits, chip-off attacks, firmware downgrades and emulation, or JTAG. Of course, these methods are slow, expensive, and require physical possession of the phone, but they do serve as a viable back-up while the software is yet to be cracked. Also, the consequence is negligible. Magnet and Cellebrite remain the two required industry standards, and even if Magnet cracks iOS first, Cellebrite remains essential. They also provide value beyond cracking the phones in evidence management and triage, ensuring that agencies still fundamentally need the products at the end of the day. Lastly, the firm’s superior R&D spend, privileged law enforcement relationships, and elite ex-Apple/Android talent pipeline ensure ongoing technical leadership. 2. Management Turnover – The founder/CEO left after 20 years, initially spooking investors. The new CEO, a Cellebrite veteran and longtime board member, has stabilized operations and proven execution under DOGE uncertainty through successful upsell initiatives. His enterprise software experience supports continuity. **Valuation** Under conservative assumptions—3% price increases (vs. 5% historical), 40% Guardian penetration (vs. 50% target), \~2.5 average seat growth per customer from FedRAMP expansion, minimal near-term federal uplift, steady margins, and an 8.5x exit multiple—the model implies \~98% upside over 3 years. **Catalysts** * World Cup 2026: $1B+ in public safety funding and heightened demand for digital law enforcement tools. * Q3 2025 FedRAMP authorization: triggers cloud sales ramp in FY26. * Long-term: Guardian and Pathfinder penetration targets (50%+) achieved by FY28.",8,2,2025-10-10 03:09:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2pvyd/cellebrite_clbt_deep_moat_durable_compounder/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.912971,0.5,$T,0.6,['CLBT'],"['bull', 'bear', 'rally', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'loss', 'acquisition']",0.7457142857142857,Communication Services
T,1ok830v,ValueInvesting,GOOGLE — Time to Sell?,"I’m honestly torn on this one. I’ve been holding [GOOGL](https://www.insicard.com/stocks/GOOGL.US) for a while, and I really believe in the company’s long-term story. It’s hard to imagine a world 10 years from now where Google isn’t still dominant in AI, cloud, and digital ads. That said, I think the **price has caught up with the fundamentals** — maybe even run a bit ahead. I ran a [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)](https://www.insicard.com/start-analysis/GOOGL.US) assuming: * **10-year total revenue growth:** 400% (≈17.5% CAGR) * **Target operating margin (year 10):** 34.5% (slightly above today’s \~32.4%) Even with those optimistic inputs, I get a **fair value of \~$284**, versus the **current price around \~$283** (as of today). So even under bullish assumptions, Google looks **almost fully valued** — maybe 3–4% undervalued at best. To justify today’s price, the company would need to keep growing revenues at **\~17% per year for the next decade**, which feels like a tall order for a $2T+ business. I’m not bearish on Google — it’s still one of the best businesses in the world, with insane cash flows and unmatched competitive advantages. But at this valuation, **the risk/reward just isn’t as attractive anymore**. I’m considering **closing 50% of my position**, which currently represents about **30% of my portfolio**.

T,1o1rdha,stocks,$ARCHR…Let’s do a deeper dive into the financials…feedback wanted.,"When will the world see the $ACHR Midnight actually take off vertically, transition to horizontal flight and back to a vertical landing with four human passengers and one pilot? Next…Archer must get all FAA certifications completed…so when does this happen? Next $ACHR burned through $198 Million in the last quarter. For all of 2025 it will be approximately $688.6 - $700 million. $ACHR must produce and sell over 1,100 aircraft per year to make a 10% net income margin currently. Their stated target for only 650 aircraft annually by 2030 is hugely problematic for they must produce and sell almost twice that to have a 10% net profit margin. Their stated target the company officially has made will not see this company turning anywhere close to a net profit even by 2030. So I must ask this question…..how in the hell is $ACHR worth even $10 per share currently. To substantiate a $10 per share price $ACHR must build and sell at least 370 Midnight aircraft per year and would be substantially under the 1,100 units that substantiate a 10% net profit. At only 370 units per year $ACHR would be losing around $130 Million a year or more. On top of this…how do the people buying these units at $5 Million per unit turn a profit? With the life expectancy at 10,000 flights at 20 minutes per flight and maximum passenger capacity at 4 each seat must cost at least $500 or $2,000 for four people to fly for 20 minutes at a 10,000 flight expected life span. This cost of a $500 ticket per person would cover the $5 Million cost of the unit, an ongoing maintenance contract, the eventual complete replacement cost of the $5 million unit plus inflation, pilot expenses, taxes on ticket sells, and all other associated administrative overhead, marketing etc not to mention the cost of electrical utility charges, heliport charges, etc…and how much profit left over maybe 10-20% net profit in the end…..all of this after charging $500 per seat per each 20 minute flight. Now if you have a better formula for profits after all associated costs concerning these eVTOLs I am all ears. Don’t give me the fluff bullshit studies made to attract investors and buyer operators….I am looking at these eVTOLs at a real world cost basis and what actual profits or ROI both the Archer Aviation Company is going to make as well as the buyer operator end users are going to make….and what the actual real world cost is per seat per customer per the average 20 minute flight. At maximum usage of 2,920 hours per year each $5 Million unit will only last 3.42 years. Thats at a 40 minute duty cycle 20 minute flight+10 minute turn around+10 minute charging top-up and a 16 hour operational day. If the true lifespan of these units is only 10,000 operating flight hours as discussed in the eVTOL industry in general even if you double that number an operator will need to buy another replacement unit at about 6-7 years tops…but most likely between 3.42-7 years…on average. Will the masses really pay for the cost that will need to be charged for both the manufacturer and operator to remain profitable or….will all involved including the institutional investors as well as the private investors see a huge fomo MOMO overpriced valuation that will eventually see reality hit in massive losses as consumers are turned off by the high cost of 20 minute eVTOL taxi service? Battery power range will need to double. The cost per unit will need to be half. And the lifespan of each unit must be 10 years for the consumers to get cheaper per trip costs, and the operators themselves to stay profitable. I don’t see the initial financial model of the eVTOL industry working as a profitable enterprise with all the current data. What I do see is plenty of professional institutional investors as well as gullible private investors who are throwing money at the eVTOL industries birth because of the excitement and MOMO FOMO surrounding it all without dissecting the details.",6,49,2025-10-08 23:59:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o1rdha/archrlets_do_a_deeper_dive_into_the/,2025-11-07 16:43:10.808037,0.5,$T,0.9,"['ACHR', 'ARCHR']","['bull', 'profit', 'loss', 'ipo']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1odrhi8,ValueInvesting,Comcast (CMCSA) - overlooked and undervalued?,"At ~5× trailing earnings and a mid-teens FCF yield on equity (~15-17%), Comcast generates meaningful & durable recurring cash flows across several sectors: connectivity (cable/HFC + DOCSIS 4.0 upgrades), media/studios (NBCU, DreamWorks, Illumination via Universal Pictures), IP like Jurassic Park, Shrek, Fast & Furious, Minions, etc. and Theme Parks. Despite low growth and broadband competition, leverage is moderate and capital returns are meaningful. All of which allow it to sustain a healthy dividend & buybacks. A re-rating to even 7–8× earnings or an 8–9% FCF yield offers material upside on top of dividends/buybacks. - Market cap: $109B - Trailing P/E: ~4.9 - Cash: ~$9.7B - Total debt: ~$101.5B - Net leverage: ~2.3× - FCF Q2’25: $4.5B - TTM FCF: $16.6B - 2024 FCF: $12.5B - FCF yield: ~15–17% - 2024 net income: ~$16.2B (note: 2025 NI is inflated by a one-time Hulu gain) - Dividend: Annual $1.32/sh (≈4.4–4.5% yield); raised 6.5% YoY in 2025 - Growth/margins: +~2% YoY - Adjusted EBITDA (Q2): ~$10.3B - TTM net margin: ~18% There are multiple angles here: 1. Organic FCF compounding + balance-sheet actions: e.g., sell-off weaker divisions; refresh/re-structure the park pipeline, RE & IP, driving incremental EBITDA; securitize the fiber to monetize long-term fiber/enterprise contracts, accelerate cash realization; recycle proceeds from aforementioned to buybacks, de-leveraging, dividends or reinvestment into the business. Reinvestment to defend ARPU and churn in my mind would look something like refreshing IP, updating the network from HFC to hybrid fiber (DOCSIS 4.0 + targeted FTTH) + non-terrestrial networks/Low Earth Orbit satellite internet (partnership, or investment in “up-&-comer”?), R&D into Terahertz and Laser Links, or, even more outside the box (perhaps too far), expanding into sub-surface energy transmission since they have the expertise. Re-rating to even 7–8× earnings or 8–9% FCF yield implies material upside. I.e. Equity accretion through deleveraging + asset sales/monetization. 2. Downside protection via dividends and buybacks, which are sustainable (buybacks are sustainable at sub 6x earnings). 3. credible take-private/break-up scenarios. I value the company right around $111bn, w/ its current market cap hovering around $110bn. The mix of hard assets, predictable cash flows, & monetizable franchises makes Comcast a plausible target for scale PE (e.g., Blackstone, Apollo, Ellison, Berkshire Howard Hughes…). If taken private you sell off less desirable assets/divisions (like peacock); pivot to aggregation/licensing the IP; securitize the fiber network; sale-leaseback of marquee properties (which could include the parks) to an SPV, which becomes a separate vehicle entirely open to a distinct risk averse investor class (same with the fiber), & suddenly you’ve de-risked the deal and see a ROI within ~5 years. At ~4.9× earnings with a ~15-17% FCF yield, manageable debt, diversified cash flows and a substantial moat across several sectors, acquisition potential, there seems to be a mispricing between perceived secular decline and actual cash-flow durability. THE BAD: Broadband competition/overabundance and streaming drag could continue to mute growth and exert pricing pressure, cannibalizing margin and FCF. Studio economics are tough. Economic slowdown hits parks and fiber contracts hard — cyclical. IP theft and aging IP. Connectivity competition from companies like SpaceX. The obvious regulatory risk, especially with fiber. And, of course, execution risk - I’m not a huge fan of the current leadership. But even then, it’s still a bit of a cigar butt based on the balance sheet (i.e. cash, tangible/valuable real property, FCF yield) and moats (you can’t just go out and build an internet network, theme park or make the next DreamWorks) cushioning total returns via dividends and buybacks. But, this is less of a cigar and closer to a quality compounder temporarily priced like a no-growth utility For those interested, this has me down the rabbit hole and I plan to look at GILT next.",6,16,2025-10-23 02:17:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1odrhi8/comcast_cmcsa_overlooked_and_undervalued/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.074203,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'market cap', 'acquisition']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1odh8zu,ValueInvesting,COSCO Shipping: The Geopolitical Compounder Hiding in Plain Sight,"Great analysis of COSCO Shipping 🚢 https://open.substack.com/pub/goldenoraclechina/p/cosco-shipping-the-geopolitical-compounder?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=6oba9s COSCO isn’t just undervalued — it’s misunderstood. Its strategic alignment with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, tech-driven transformation, and unmatched global footprint position it for long-term dominance. What are your thoughts? COSCO Shipping: The Geopolitical Compounder Hiding in Plain Sight ⚠️ Disclaimer This content is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Always conduct your own research or consult a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions. COSCO Shipping isn’t just another logistics company — it’s a strategic behemoth at the heart of China’s global ambitions. Yet today, it trades at fire-sale valuations, with its Hong Kong-listed shares priced at a fraction of their intrinsic value — and a full 26% discount compared to its mainland A-shares. Investors are overlooking a titan that’s not only profitable and dividend-paying, but also poised to dominate the next era of global trade. From automated smart ports to the Arctic shipping corridor that could reshape Eurasian logistics, COSCO is underpinned by deep strategic investments in infrastructure as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Its unmatched efficiency and scale could drive explosive growth in demand, not just market share — making COSCO a rare blend of income, innovation, and geopolitical leverage in a mispriced industry. 📦 Why Shipping Is the Smart Money’s Play — and Retail Is Missing Out The backbone of global trade is entering a tech-driven growth phase — and it’s still mispriced. 🛳️ Industry Primer: How Shipping Works Shipping is a B2B business at the core of global trade. Companies like COSCO move goods for manufacturers and retailers through: 📃 Long-term contracts for predictable cash flows ⚡ Spot deals to capture high rates during demand spikes The core unit is the container, and carriers charge per container shipped. Vessels offer global flexibility — agile operators can redeploy ships anywhere to meet demand or respond to disruptions. 🌐 The Broader Supply Chain 🏗️ Shipbuilding: China now produces over 50% of global shipbuilding output (since 2023), reinforcing its dominance in maritime infrastructure. ⚓ Port Infrastructure: Smart ports and automated terminals reduce turnaround times and costs, becoming a competitive edge. 🚚 Intermodal Logistics: Containers move seamlessly from ships to trucks and rail, requiring integrated networks and alliances. 🔋 Fuel & Decarbonization: LNG and alternative fuels are reshaping cost structures and compliance with IMO regulations. Shipping is deeply capital- and labour-intensive, spanning shipbuilding, port logistics, heavy machinery operations, and ongoing vessel servicing. From constructing billion-dollar vessels to coordinating global container flows, the industry relies on vast infrastructure and skilled labour to keep trade moving. Beneath the surface, shipping is becoming a data-driven industry. AI is quietly transforming operations — from predictive maintenance and route optimization to automated port logistics and fuel efficiency modelling. As vessels, ports, and containers become smarter, the hidden AI play lies in orchestrating this complexity at scale, unlocking cost savings and agility across the supply chain. 📉 Shipping: Unloved and Unappreciated Over the past decade, investor capital has overwhelmingly rotated into high-growth sectors like technology, leaving traditional industries such as shipping in the shadows. The chart below — 10-Year Inflation-Adjusted Performance: DJGSH vs QQQ — illustrates this divergence vividly. While QQQ (tech-heavy Nasdaq) has surged over 300% in real terms, the Dow Jones Global Shipping Index (DJGSH) has barely moved, hovering near its starting point. This stark underperformance signals that shipping has been systematically ignored by growth-focused investors. [Source: Dow Jones, Invesco, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics] 📌 Why This Matters Shipping is priced like a dying industry — but the fundamentals tell a different story. Here’s why investors should pay attention: ⚖️ 1. Structural Pessimism vs Reality The market treats shipping as if it’s in secular decline. In reality, the industry boasts: Strong balance sheets Persistent cash flows High return on capital employed (ROCE) High barriers to entry Rapid technological innovation 📈 2. Mean Reversion Potential Historically, extreme valuation compression in shipping has preceded sharp rebounds — especially when: Global trade normalizes Supply-demand dynamics tighten 💸 3. Income + Optionality Investors today can lock in double-digit yields while retaining upside from: Cyclical recovery Long-term structural shifts (e.g., Technological innovation, Belt and Road corridors, Arctic routes) Regardless of economic cycles, goods must move. Shipping companies generate consistent cash flows from essential trade routes — and supercharge earnings during market shocks. For contrarian investors, this disconnect between perception and reality creates a rare opportunity: buy a cash-rich, strategically vital industry at crisis-level valuations while the crowd chases momentum elsewhere. 📊 Cosco’s unique valuation: Industry Comparison COSCO trades at a P/E of just 3.4, far below its Western peers. Its 14.3% dividend yield is backed by strong cash flows and a disciplined payout policy, targeting 30–50% of net profits annually. Moreover, its Market Capitalisation is trading below Book Value, with an enormous $24bn in cash on the balance sheet. COSCO has delivered a 30% ROCE over the past five years — well above its 7% WACC, signalling robust value creation. The valuation gap reflects geopolitical bias and cyclical stigma, not fundamentals. 🧠 COSCO’s Strategic Positioning ⚙️ 1. Cost Structure 👷 Labor: Lower costs in China, amplified by automation and AI-driven smart ports, cut operational costs by up to 60% per container move using Level 4 autonomous trucks. [Source: Cosco Shipping] 💰 Capital: Preferential financing as a state-owned enterprise and favourable bond yields reduces borrowing costs. As stated in my previous sub-stack, the Chinese bond market yields favourable conditions for Chinese enterprise. 🏗️ Materials & Production: China’s shipbuilding dominance (>50% global output) and COSCO’s vertical integration in container manufacturing deliver lower vessel costs, shorter lead times, and superior unit economics. [Source: hkexnews] 🌍 2. Strategic Growth Levers Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) COSCO has invested RMB 79 billion (USD 11 billion) in BRI-related projects, including 21 overseas terminals (e.g., Piraeus, Abu Dhabi, Chancay). These assets secure control over critical trade nodes and enable COSCO to offer end-to-end logistics solutions across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. [Source: Seatrade Maritime News] Arctic Route (Polar Silk Road) Trials on the Northern Sea Route cut Asia-Europe transit times by up to 40% (~10 days), reducing fuel costs and emissions while bypassing congested and politically sensitive routes. COSCO is partnering with Russia to develop ice-class vessels for year-round Arctic operations. [Source: The Arctic Review] AI-Powered Smart Ports COSCO’s deployment of Level 4 autonomous trucks, IoT-enabled reefer containers, and blockchain-based green shipping certificates is transforming port efficiency and ESG credentials. [Sources: Cosco Shipping, Porttechnology.org] Why This Matters COSCO combines cost leadership with strategic optionality: When we look at the trend, we can see an exponential increase in Operating Cash Flow per share on the horizon, a key indicator of cash generation operating in a capital-intensive environment. [Source: COSCO Shipping Holdings] 🌐 Global Trade and Tariffs: The Risk the Market Overstates Much of COSCO’s undervaluation stems from Trump-era tariffs on Chinese-operated and Chinese-built ships. For example: But trade wars are cyclical, not permanent. COSCO can mitigate tariff exposure by: Leveraging its 30% foreign built fleet Rerouting capacity toward ASEAN, EU, Africa, and Latin America, where demand is growing and tariffs are less punitive [Source: Seatrade Maritime] 🧠 Final Thoughts “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” — Warren Buffett COSCO isn’t just undervalued — it’s misunderstood. Its strategic alignment with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, tech-driven transformation, and unmatched global footprint position it for long-term dominance. The market is pricing it like a cyclical commodity stock, but beneath the surface, the fundamentals tell a different story: COSCO is a cornerstone of the next era of global trade and the technological revolution.

T,1oldv9p,ValueInvesting,Looking for insight: What companies will actually define the future (and at what price would  they be a fair buy)?,"Hey everyone, Long story short, I’m still in college, and for the first time in my life I’ve started earning enough to have some disposable income. Because of this, I got into investing about a year ago year, partly because I’ve always followed technology and I’m fascinated by where the future is headed. That said, when markets started dipping last year due to Trump’s tariffs, I was convinced, partly by the people around me, that it was all over. with my limited experience, I made the choice to sell everything at what was literally the dip of the dip on liberation day. I see now that I made this decision at the ""peak of mt stupid"" in terms of the Dunning-Kruger effect, and i've gotten wiser since then after internalizing the wisdom of Buffett, Graham, and a wide range of other insightful perspectives. As well as learning more about economic history and context in general. However, since then i still never re-entered the market, but recently I feel a rising urgency that I need to (because a HYSA just isn't cutting it due to inflation and interest rate cuts, as well as the potential in the Ai/tech revolution). But the dilemma is obvious by now: everything feels unsustainably expensive. Waiting for a correction sounds good in theory, but the problem is timing. When it comes, there’s no way of knowing how deep it’ll go — it could be a multi-year bear market, or it could rebound to new highs before I even know how to react. Either way, I don’t want to be stuck on the sidelines. It seems to me like the only logical way forward is to identify which companies will actually hold long-term value — not just the current megacaps, but growth companies that will *truly* play a role in shaping the future. I’m not talking about speculative penny stocks, but solid growth names that may also be overvalued now, but have real potential none the less. From there, I want to set price targets — points where these stocks would represent fair value — so I’m ready to buy when opportunities arise. **In summary:** 1. What companies do you believe will define the coming decade(s) and continue to grow with a high expected ROI — and why? 2. What would you consider *fair value* prices for these companies — prices you’d feel good about paying even if they dip lower afterward, with long-term conviction in mind? I know I could ask AI or Google this and get the usual consensus, but I’m really looking for diverse perspectives-- actual investors with real-world takes that might deviate from the Wall Street narrative or conventional models. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!",1,9,2025-11-01 03:20:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oldv9p/looking_for_insight_what_companies_will_actually/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.880433,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['bear', 'dip', 'rally']",0.7171428571428571,Communication Services
T,1okv38n,ValueInvesting,"While KT screens as a value play, the lack of a moat kept me from investing","KT looks cheap: 5x forward earnings, 4% dividend, EV/EBITDA 4x,but I’m passing. In a 3-player market that should mint steady returns, Korea’s telcos keep earning ROIC below WACC and spraying cash into side quests (AI, fintech, media, real estate). My base-case value is $19.3 per ADR (basically fair) so the risk/reward isn’t there. **What looked attractive** * Structure: Three national operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus). High barriers to entry, spectrum moat, massive capex already sunk. * Price: KT trades at bargain multiples and pays a solid dividend. * Hidden assets: Meaningful real-estate portfolio and a cloud/data-center business; potential for “value-up” monetization. * Recent optics: Margins improved off 2024’s one-offs; buybacks and a more explicit shareholder-return posture. On paper this is the kind of steady compounder you want in the income sleeve. **Why I cooled off** 1) No durable edge. KT doesn’t beat peers on network, brand, or pricing power. In a rational oligopoly you’d expect fat margins; in Korea, the players still compete hard. The result is decent service for consumers and mediocre economics for shareholders. 2) ROIC tells the truth. Over a decade, KT’s ROIC has sat below its cost of capital. Same story for the leader, SKM, albeit slightly better. That means growth has destroyed value at the margin. 3) Capital allocation drift. Instead of doubling down on the core (where scale should matter), KT chased adjacency after adjacency from AI platforms, content studios, payments to real-estate projects. 4) Governance and politics. CEO churn, state-linked influence, and recurring investigations are not the ingredients of a focused, long-term plan. Even good operators struggle when the goalposts move. 5) Saturation + aging. Mobile subs exceed the population; broadband is near universal. Upsell gets harder as demographics tilt older and price sensitivity rises. 5G/6G add cost faster than revenue. **Valuation (details here https://www.beatingthetide.com/i/176947346/valuation-dcf-and-sum-of-the-parts)** * DCF base case: I anchor group EBITDA margin in the high-teens, capex \~12% of revenue, modest top-line growth, and conservative working capital. That lands at \~$19.3/ADR...basically where it trades. * SOTP cross-check: * Core ICT at 5.5x EV/EBITDA * Finance (BC Card / K-Bank exposure) at a haircut multiple * Real estate marked well below blue-sky talk * Cloud/Content at a discounted private-market comp * Less net debt/minorities → $24/ADR in a cleaner, value-unlock scenario. That’s upside, but not “must-own” upside given execution and political risk. **What would change my mind** * ROIC > WACC with proof it’s durable. Two or three clean years would get attention. * Refocus the portfolio. Spin, sell, or ring-fence non-core assets; recycle proceeds to buybacks or the highest-return pieces of the network. * Policy stability. Less meddling in pricing and management seats, more predictability on spectrum and subsidies. * AI numbers: Real revenue, real margins, real customers at scale. **Why I’m not short either** KT is not broken. Cash flows are real. The balance sheet isn’t reckless. You’ll likely get your dividend while the stock grinds sideways. I just don’t see a credible path to outsized returns versus better opportunities elsewhere. **My stance** Neutral/Hold. 1–3 year horizon, fair value $19.3 per ADR. KT is a value trap dressed like a bargain: cheap for reasons that haven’t gone away, sub-WACC returns, diffuse strategy, political overhang, and a saturated market. Could it work tactically? Sure. Is it one of the best risk-adjusted setups I can own today? Not for me. Happy to share my model assumptions if you want to stress-test the margins or multiples.

T,1oq5eu1,investing,"$RENT - PE Sharks Circle the Runway: Thin Float, Take-Private Setup, 4X Special Situation","TL;DR: Rent the Runway ($RENT)(RTR), a subscription fashion rental firm recently de-risked after an Oct 2025 recap ($223 M swap, ~33 M shares, PE trio ~86%). Now $4 stock ripe for take-private. PE could lowball $6–8 above market- a steal! - yet fair value sits ~$15–18 (~4× upside) and barely dents their IRR. Market just needs to wake up and re-rate. This isn’t a long-term bullish thesis on RTR’s success- it’s a structural read. Ownership, recap terms, and incentives indicate a likely take-private situation; the focus is ensuring holders receive fair value. DYOR, not advice. Quick Biz Summary and RTR History: Rent the Runway (RTR), founded in 2009 by Jennifer Hyman (still CEO), lets women rent designer clothing through a subscription “closet in the cloud.” It went public in 2021 at $21/share, reaching a peak valuation above $1 billion before COVID aftershocks and mounting debt derailed growth. The company later pivoted to resale and brand rev-share partnerships with a sustainability angle. Revenue is about $300 million, profitability returned in 2024, and following the October 2025 recap, RTR now trades around a $130 million market cap (~$250 million enterprise value)- a fraction of its IPO-era value. What Just Happened- Restructuring Bombshell: On October 28, 2025, Rent the Runway completed a major recapitalization led by private equity firm APS, its largest lender. The deal converted $223 million of debt into equity at $9.23 per share and added $20 million in new cash. Debt dropped to about $120million, with maturity extended to 2029. The share count ballooned from roughly 4 million to 33.4 million, creating heavy dilution. The PE trio (APS, STORY3, and Nexus) now controls about 86% of the company (roughly 29million shares). The board was restructured with their appointees, and ownership rights tied to control thresholds. That leaves just 4.8 million shares in the public float- financially de-risked but thinly traded, positioning it for a swift re-rate once visibility improves. What PE Players See- 2024 Wins, 2025 Investments, Growth Guidance: This isn’t about RTR’s long-term success, but about how PE values the setup. In 2024, the company finally pivoted to profitability- roughly $47 million in adjusted EBITDA (15% margin), $13 million in operating cash flow, and subscriptions up 13% year over year in Q2. The soft revenue and margin dips in early 2025 (about –7%) seem deliberate, tied to increased spending on inventory, brand partnerships, and marketing to re-accelerate growth. Subscriptions reached record highs (+1% YoY in Q1), with management guiding to 10%+ growth for the full year (!). From a PE lens, RTR now looks like a stabilized, cash-generating platform with minimal near-term credit risk- ideal conditions for a controlled take-private. Why This Screams Take-Private: With ~86% control, a thin float, and a cleaned-up balance sheet, this is a textbook PE setup for a take-private. Once the group crosses Delaware’s 90% ownership threshold, it can execute a short-form merger- no shareholder vote required. Minority holders are converted to cash at a price set by the board, with only limited “appraisal rights.” In practice, those challenges are rare and costly, meaning control effectively sets the price. Buying the remaining ~14% public float at an $8 lowball would cost about $39 million- pocket change. Even paying a fair $15–18 per share would cost roughly $73–87 million, still well within reach and only trimming a few points off a 25–30% IRR on a $500–600 million exit in three to five years. The structure and incentives align perfectly: private equity holds the cards, the balance sheet is de-risked, and the public float is small enough to take out quietly. The only variable is visibility- if the market stays asleep, retail gets cashed out cheap; if not, PE has to pay fair value. Valuation model check: RTR’s 2024 turnaround base case: ~$47 million in adjusted EBITDA on ~$300 million revenue, ~$120 million net debt post-recap, and ~33.4 million diluted shares outstanding. At a conservative 10–12× EV/EBITDA (roughly in line with profitable consumer-subscription peers) the equity screens at $10–14 per share. A modest re-rate to 13–14× for growth visibility and balance-sheet strength lands at $15–18 per share. That’s the range private equity would model for a clean take-private: full control, de-risked balance sheet, and still a 25–30% IRR on a $500–600 million re-IPO or sale. Paying fair here for the remaining 14% of float doesn’t hurt them it actually strengthens their exit story, giving them a higher private mark to re-IPO against. At take-private pricing: Exit Multiple | Enterprise Value Less Net Debt | Equity Value Per-Share 10× EBITDA | ~$470M–$120M=~$350M | ~$10/share 11× EBITDA | ~$520M–$120M=~$400M | ~$12/share 12× EBITDA | ~$564M–$120M=~$444M | ~$13–14/share 13× EBITDA | ~$610M–$120M=~$490M |~$15–16/share 14× EBITDA | ~$658M–$120M=~$538M |~$17–18/share What’s Attractive for Each PE Firm: APS (Aranda Principal Strategies)- Lead lender turned majority owner (~60% stake). Entered at $9.23/share via debt-to-equity conversion. Credit-focused, targeting a 1.1–1.6× return ($10–15/share exit) for a 15–25% IRR over 2–4 years. Likely to push a take-private, then sell its stake to STORY3/Nexus once control is secured. STORY3 Capital Partners- Consumer-focused investor (~13% stake), entered around $4.08/share. Sees brand and subscription revival potential, aiming for 3–6× upside ($15–26/share) and 25–40% IRR over a 4–7 year horizon. Positioned to buy APS’s stake and drive the eventual re-IPO or sale. Nexus Capital Management- Special-situations investor (~13% stake), also entered near $4.08/share. Targets 2.5–5× return ($10–22/share) and 20–35% IRR, focused on operational leverage and logistics optimization. Likely co-buyer of APS’s position alongside STORY3. Collectively, the trio has invested over $240 million, signaling long-term conviction. Offloading shares into the thin float would crater their own value and control, so they’re here for rebuild IRRs, not short-term flips. Even at $15–18 per share, STORY3 and Nexus gain little by selling- liquidity is limited, and exiting early would jeopardize their governance rights and 90% control path. Their real upside comes from taking RTR private, scaling it quietly, and re-listing later at a far higher valuation. Final thoughts: The setup here is simple: PE owns 86%, the balance sheet is clean, and the float is microscopic. The next logical move is a take-private once they cross Delaware’s 90% threshold. The math works either way: an $8 squeeze-out costs them pocket change, while paying fair value at $15–18 barely moves their IRR and strengthens their re-IPO optics later. Retail doesn’t need to bet on Rent the Runway’s long-term success to see the angle. This is a structure-driven opportunity: a thin-float, de-risked special situation where visibility alone can change the outcome. Don’t let PE Delaware-90% you out at $8 “premium” peanuts. A $15–18 fair-value buyout cost is immaterial (maybe a 1–2% IRR drag). Make them pay fair. Stop the steal. (PS- $15–18 is a reasonable premium for PE to own the upside cleanly. But with a float this thin, if sentiment turns or things get a little memey… well, it could make for quite a story #sundressSZN)",0,1,2025-11-06 17:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oq5eu1/rent_pe_sharks_circle_the_runway_thin_float/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.258388,0.5,$T,0.8,['RENT'],"['bull', 'squeeze', 'dip', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'merger', 'ipo']",0.6457142857142857,Communication Services

I’ll start off with the reason for its recent sell off and list the sentiments, with the current/potential future risks to first get them out of the way and then build a contrarian case, as to what and why I think the market is getting wrong about it. Macro related \- Tariff (needless to say it has few, but not concentrated, suppliers in china) \- Mgmt has to revise their guidance lower, yet growing on a yoy basis \- Sales in their US market slowed \- Because of weakening of the $ income from overseas ops is estimated to have \~$240MM of slippage this year Idiosyncratic risk \- Prices have gone up, customers not liking it \- Competition from smaller companies who are emerging in ‘athleisure’ space \- Product innovation has plateaued off, no new line of fabric this year. # Case * Strong Balance Sheet, Virtually debt free * Over the past year, lululemon has bought back [$1.77 billion worth of stock](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-wrong-lululemon-stock) and this is a significant amount since the total market cap is now around $19 billion, and since they have been buying at higher levels they could more likely buy more shares at current lower prices [](https://preview.redd.it/lululemon-because-hot-ass-never-goes-out-of-style-v0-1h3akamakhwf1.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=9984fbe4743ca25fcf787086aaa0969345dc2766) * This company is dealing with the same issues most of its competitors are facing and this includes tariffs and reduced consumer spending as the economy slows down. It is also facing more competition as the industry sees newer entrants. However, on a relative valuation basis lulu ( \~ 10 forward pe, lower than it’s 10 y avg.) is still cheaper than other brands like Nike ( \~40 forward pe) in multiple metrics * Also, aligning with your investment style, I'm not going into macro related reasons for the bull case because I think consumer spending will pick up. I could be wrong, but historically when the economy was down there were always bear cases (ref. previous articles published on valueinvestorsclub) made for lulu, yet the company went on delivering +20% growth yoy * China is the second-largest market for Lululemon, and in the latest quarter, revenues grew by 25%. The rest of the world's revenues grew at about 19%, and this is impressive for a stock trading at just around 12 times earnings. They have a lot of room to grow internationally. They haven’t launched in big markets like India or other few rich middle eastern/east asian counties. Until now people would wear to gym whatever is clean in the laundry basket, but Lulu has changed that and opened to the new ‘athleisure’ market outside of sports * Lulu is still growing in the men's section about 1/3rd of their sales is in me and they don’t offer as many products for men as for women, so that market could drive further growth as from my personal observation I’ve seen more people in my office wearing lulu quarterzips than the patagonia vests Out of my personal curiosity I looked up once why patagonia vests are so popular in the office, is that a fad? Or even if it is, then why so? I found that it is because of its utility of it in terms of looking smart casual, it keeps the core warm, and does not restrict the hand movement, there’s mobility We can draw this parallel to Lululemon now, that their athletic business casual section for men, is even lighter, and more flexible * It carries brand moat - Showed by really high EBIT (\~20%) margins/Gross margins (\~60%) unlikely in other peers [](https://preview.redd.it/lululemon-because-hot-ass-never-goes-out-of-style-v0-zveeseqdkhwf1.jpg?width=635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9ae622cd31c66c3b2bc51936c7500082dbb319d) * Direct-to-consumer model: own stores/e-comm, and most of their sales through their own channels, where they don’t wholesale but directly sell it which gives them an analytical edge. They see what’s popular in their drops and only stack that on their stores and kill the products line from manufacturing and distribution that doesn’t get as good of a response somewhat like moonshot project by google which was interesting * Proprietary fabrics: Nulu, Nulux, Warpstreme, Everlux, Luxtreme - these are some of their own fabrics blend, that’s why even though there are similar looking cheaper replicas available, ‘they just don’t “feel” the same’ (a comment, i kept seeing online) * I was looking at insider buying and didn’t see any activity however, Michael burry took a \`13% position of Lulu In q2 this year with leap calls included. This is when the stock was at a much higher price. * Lulu was not into partnership, now they’re getting in it They recently did one with Amex, where amex cardholders will get some % off on merch & (IBJJF) International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation people get 25% discount - so catering to fit people and making their image that ‘hot’ people wear our clothes.

Lululemon has a ""Quality Promise"" that covers items that have manufacturing defects or aren't performing as intended within one year of purchase. So company and people both swear by their quality [](https://preview.redd.it/lululemon-because-hot-ass-never-goes-out-of-style-v0-ri7ikdq0qhwf1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5b5f21ae9c98fc91f9b9b05712ab2a8efdcd8f) * Another observation I could see was, Lululemon’s clothes sell at a premium on used marketplace like ebay, depop, poshmark than peers who have similar priced offerings. Commanding higher premiums * All analysts who are covering their stock are mostly assigning a hold/buy rating, i looked up each analyst mentioned in their Investor portal and noted what target price they’ve assigned.

Essentially the management getting greedy, and messing up. * If currently trending baggier clothes become mainstream trends, because trends are cyclical in the fashion industry. # TL;DR Lululemon currently presents a GARP opportunity, with solid business with clear direction for growth, strong cashflow (\~5.5% fcf yield), loyal customer base, RSI close to 30 a good proxy for bottom, share buybacks, new partnerships, I think market is just overly pessimistic due to short -term macro noise, and slowed consumer spendings, so with all the given drivers, and catalysts it’s just matter of time when markets’ view turnaround to give a massive upside to the price and stock closes to its’ fair value. Under current valuations the market is pricing in no-growth to a slight negative growth for the company. *P.S. - There'd be a bunch of misspelling I wrote this sitting on an airport waiting for flight, and this is a draft - as of one week old*",4,3,2025-11-01 15:49:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1olr6kd/lululemon_because_hot_a_never_goes_out_of_style/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.875334,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'calls', 'earnings', 'moon', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.6457142857142857,Communication Services
T,1onagfr,ValueInvesting,Tachibana Eletech,"I found another Japanese net-net that looks very compelling: * 76% of NCAV * 10x earnings * Repurchasing 4% * Doubling TBV in 10 years [https://substack.com/home/post/p-177879529](https://substack.com/home/post/p-177879529) Tachibana Eletech—TYO 8159—is a small Japanese trading company specializing in factory automation products, semiconductors & electronic devices, and building services systems. With a strong balance sheet, over ¥200 billion in sales ($1.3 billion), decent returns on equity, a management focus on shareholder returns, and a relatively low valuation, I consider Tachibana to be a good risk/reward opportunity. **Balance Sheet** Like the previous Japanese net-nets I’ve profiled, Tachibana’s balance sheet is inventory-light with a huge portion in cash & marketable securities. Only 24% of Tachibana’s current assets are inventory, and ⅓ are cash & marketable securities. The largest item is receivables, which also has a low probability of impairment. Current assets exceed total liabilities by more than 2 times, which is a solid measure that protects the value of net assets against impairments. **Business** Tachibana’s business grew at a reasonable rate until FY 2024, growing revenue from ¥162 billion to ¥231 billion. After FY 2024, revenue is mean-reverting and has begun to decline, with only ¥216 billion in the trailing twelve months. Overall, the business hasn't posted a single operating or net loss in the last 10 years. Over the last 10 years, the business has generated a return on equity of 7.1%. Like many Japanese companies, a 7% ROE is not ideal, but considering most companies can borrow at rates way below 7%, it is not terrible. This doesn’t consider that a huge portion of the company's equity is comprised of marketable securities not required to run the business. Post-tax operating income over the last 10 years is about ¥48 billion; total equity minus marketable securities is ¥526 billion, meaning the business generated a 9.1% return. **Valuation** Tachibana is trading at 76% of net current assets and under 70% of TBV. Any profitable company trading under NCAV is usually very cheap; you are getting the cash & equivalents, receivables, and inventory minus all liabilities at a discount, plus all the fixed assets for free. Even based on earnings, a company that trades at 70% of TBV that can generate a 7% return on that book value is basically yielding the investor a 10% return. This means that the company is investing its money in repurchases at a 10% return, and this doesn’t consider that almost 30% of the companies' TBV are marketable securities not needed to run the business. **Capital Allocation** Tachibana released their “Action to Implement Management that is Conscious of Cost of Capital and Stock Price” last August. The most interesting piece of the release is the following: Point #2 states that the company intends to reduce cross-shareholdings, meaning that they will dispose of some of their marketable securities. This should give the company more cash to use for repurchases. Point #3 signals that the company intends to keep repurchasing shares. And they’ve continued to do so. In September, they repurchased 132k shares, and each month they have repurchased a small portion of the 1 million share target. 1 million shares were 4.35% of total shares when the program was announced in May. What I like about the repurchase is that it is the 3rd year they’ve done it, meaning that there is a compromise by management to return capital to shareholders, even before formally announcing a plan. If they keep repurchasing 1 million shares per year, it becomes a higher and higher percent of total shares as the years go by. They also announced a 50% or higher payout ratio; the annual dividend of ¥100 itself covers over ⅓ of EPS, but the rest is done through repurchases. And as I said before, the company is repurchasing shares at a discount to TBV and NCAV, essentially investing their money at over 10%. A data point that I always bring up in Japanese net-nets is how fast TBV/share is compounding. This shows the company is not throwing away shareholders' money into unprofitable ventures, and it also helps when the company is trying to achieve a 1x P/B, because that “B” is growing. The company has compounded tangible book value per share at 7.4% in the last 10 years while paying 2-3% dividends on that TBV: Tachibana is currently paying out over 50% of their earnings to shareholders, buying back stocks at cheap valuations, and the earnings it retains are providing a 7% return. **How might this investment go wrong?** 1. I do not have any special insight into the business. I do not know if management are crooks or if the business will become obsolete. 2. No further shareholder returns are conducted. The company might not conduct further share repurchases; not returning capital in Japan will likely make the stock a value trap. In the case of Tachibana, I think this likelihood is much lower than in most Japanese net-nets. This company is closer to SE Holdings (which I wrote up in March) than others. 3. Tachibana isn’t the cheapest net-net out there. In Japan, 70% of TBV is not super cheap, so it might not look as cheap to other investors. Trading at 76% of NCAV and below TBV, while repurchasing shares is an opportunity with low risk of huge downside, with the likelihood of re-rating higher. Also, having a big cash & marketable securities pile gives the company optionality to conduct even bigger repurchases.

T,1oiwdhm,ValueInvesting,We Ride At Dawn - This Is Not A Drill,"# The Flashing Signals * **Off-the-Charts Short Interest.** It's massively shorted – roughly 11.38 million shares are sold short, about 36.5% of its public float**.** At current volume, covering takes 10 trading days. By any metric this is a red‑flag level: Schwab notes stocks with over 10% of float shorted are warning signs, we're well beyond that. In practice this “short fuel” means any spark of buying (even headline noise or technical relief) would force short sellers to scramble to cover, igniting a squeeze. * **Deeply Oversold Technicals & Meme Buzz.** It's been beaten down hard – it’s down 55% year‑to‑date, trading within pennies of its 52‑week low. Momentum indicators show extreme oversold readings and panic selling. The extremely low price base suggests a coiled spring setup ready to bounce. * **Imminent Catalyst – Earnings (Oct 30).** The key catalyst arrives this week: reporting Q1 Fiscal 2026 results on Thursday, Oct. 30 [businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251008009933/en/1-800-FLOWERS.COM-Inc.-to-Release-its-Fiscal-2026-First-Quarter-Results-on-Thursday-October-30-2025#:~:text=JERICHO%2C%20N.Y.,will%20be%20followed%20by%20a). The combination of a crushed stock and massive short interest sets up a classic squeeze. Any result that comes in *better than feared* (or even just not as bad) would rip. In that case, shorts would need to cover en masse when the market opens, pushing the stock sharply higher. * **Hidden Scarcity Signal (FTD vs. Borrow Rates).** Beyond headlines settlement data hints at share scarcity. On one hand, cost‑to‑borrow is low (3.5% annual APR as of late October) suggesting borrow rates aren’t spiking yet. On the other hand, failures‑to‑deliver (FTDs) have exploded: reported FTD dollar volume is up 221% year-over-year. MANY more shares are failing to settle than a year ago – proving there aren’t enough shares to go around. High FTDs often precede a squeeze, because when the catalyst hits, parties with unmet obligations are to buy. That forced buying amplifies our rally, pushing it into a gamma squeeze over multiple days. * **What’s Next for the Community** The pieces are in place, but execution matters. Be disciplined and patient. Hold through volatility – avoid the temptation to sell into strength too early, which just gives shorts an escape route. Stay focused on the data: watch daily changes in short %, borrow costs, and options open interest (call buying can fuel hedges) to gauge momentum. * This discussion is about the setup, not financial advice. * But I like the stock.",0,3,2025-10-29 05:32:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oiwdhm/we_ride_at_dawn_this_is_not_a_drill/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.041714,0.5,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'shorts', 'squeeze', 'rally', 'volume']",0.6285714285714286,Communication Services

It was not a going to get into the spx but when i did my DD it seemed like a great stock at the time (priced at around $40 then now at aorund $200). Please do your own research and DD, none of this is financial advice. NAND flash prices have surged 15-20% since late Q3 with some TLC spot quotes hitting +25% (per DRAMeXchange). The drive? AI data centers - hyperscalers like GOOG or AMZN are shifting from HDD to SSDs for faster inference and model serving. TrendForce expects 30%+ NAND demand growth in 2025 and market size topping $100B+. Suppliers like Samsung, Sky Hynix and Sandisk are still holding back capacity setting up what traders are calling a memory super-cycle. Numbers: * Business: Pure NAND play - SSD, Flash cards, embedded chips. Lean structure post spin * Next earnings: Nov 6 (Q1 FY26) first major standalone quarter * Street view: $2.3B rev / 0.7 EPS consensus * Bull Case: Spot pricing strengths could push revenues toward £3B+ with $1.1-1.3 EPS if margins can hit 50-60% * Valuation: around 18x forward P/E - still cheaper than MU given SNDK pure play NAND exposure. Why it could Run AI workloads -> exponential storage needs, hyperscalers signing long term NAND contracts, locking in supply I believe NAND prices will hold or even increase, memory is in short supply at the moment and overlooked.

T,1ojyk7t,investing,Is $LRN undervalued right now? and why I think it is. open for discussion,"Hello everyone, These are my two cents to why I think $LRN is undervalued now, This is my first written DD (if you can call it that) so let me know your opinion on the topic, especially if its not the same as mine. As of writing this, I am not and never was invested in this company. On october 28th, Stride presented their Q1 FY2026 earnings presentation (https://investors.stridelearning.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) They beat revenue and EPS expectations according to (https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LRN&p=d) EPS estimate 1.07$ < 1.52$ actual Revenue estimate 613.3M$ < 621M$ (slightly lower from Q4 FY2025 654M$) They have higher enrollment numbers compared to the same 3 month timeframe in 2024. So why did the stock plummet about 50%? According to their CEO, James Rhyu, They implemented changes to their platform, which didnt go as planned *The implementations did not go as smoothly as we anticipated. We are actively engaged with our vendors to improve the situation. We heard from our customers that their engagement with these platforms detracted from their overall experience. This poor customer experience has resulted in some higher withdrawal and lower conversion rates than we expected.* \- James Rhyu (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-stride-stock-plummeting-today-153731196.html) **Is this 50% downward correction justified?** If the only problem is bad implementation of new software which hindered user experience, No. At least not in my opinion. And I have two points to support that: First: Implementation of new software seldom goes according to plan, stuff breaks, users need to get used to stuff differently, even if its actually better. Enrollment was a bit lower, depending on which numbers you compare but not by much. Second: Suboptimally implemented software is a problem that lies almost completely within the company, its a issues they can fix (if they want to and know how to of course). Its not a factory looming over their head which they cant change. With all these facts in mind, correction seems to just come from lower enrollment/conversion rates, not form bad Earnings per se. My two points that I made just above I dont feel like a 50% correction is justified. And it seems like some Analysts agree: Many didnt update their pricetargets yet, but those who did are all in the 108-130$ USD Range, all with Market Perform/Equalweight to Buy Ratings. Let me know what you think, im happy to discuss but at the moment i will keep a look at it, maybe wait untill the Q2 FY2026 report is out before i make my buy decission but certainly looks really interesting.",7,5,2025-10-30 12:39:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ojyk7t/is_lrn_undervalued_right_now_and_why_i_think_it/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.283643,0.5,$T,0.8,['LRN'],"['earnings', 'support', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.6228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1okv2u9,investing,"While KT screens as a value play, the lack of a moat kept me from investing","KT looks cheap: 5x forward earnings, 4% dividend, EV/EBITDA 4x,but I’m passing. In a 3-player market that should mint steady returns, Korea’s telcos keep earning ROIC below WACC and spraying cash into side quests (AI, fintech, media, real estate). My base-case value is $19.3 per ADR (basically fair) so the risk/reward isn’t there. **What looked attractive** * Structure: Three national operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus). High barriers to entry, spectrum moat, massive capex already sunk. * Price: KT trades at bargain multiples and pays a solid dividend. * Hidden assets: Meaningful real-estate portfolio and a cloud/data-center business; potential for “value-up” monetization. * Recent optics: Margins improved off 2024’s one-offs; buybacks and a more explicit shareholder-return posture. On paper this is the kind of steady compounder you want in the income sleeve. **Why I cooled off** 1) No durable edge. KT doesn’t beat peers on network, brand, or pricing power. In a rational oligopoly you’d expect fat margins; in Korea, the players still compete hard. The result is decent service for consumers and mediocre economics for shareholders. 2) ROIC tells the truth. Over a decade, KT’s ROIC has sat below its cost of capital. Same story for the leader, SKM, albeit slightly better. That means growth has destroyed value at the margin. 3) Capital allocation drift. Instead of doubling down on the core (where scale should matter), KT chased adjacency after adjacency from AI platforms, content studios, payments to real-estate projects. 4) Governance and politics. CEO churn, state-linked influence, and recurring investigations are not the ingredients of a focused, long-term plan. Even good operators struggle when the goalposts move. 5) Saturation + aging. Mobile subs exceed the population; broadband is near universal. Upsell gets harder as demographics tilt older and price sensitivity rises. 5G/6G add cost faster than revenue. **Valuation (details here https://www.beatingthetide.com/i/176947346/valuation-dcf-and-sum-of-the-parts)** * DCF base case: I anchor group EBITDA margin in the high-teens, capex \~12% of revenue, modest top-line growth, and conservative working capital. That lands at \~$19.3/ADR...basically where it trades. * SOTP cross-check: * Core ICT at 5.5x EV/EBITDA * Finance (BC Card / K-Bank exposure) at a haircut multiple * Real estate marked well below blue-sky talk * Cloud/Content at a discounted private-market comp * Less net debt/minorities → $24/ADR in a cleaner, value-unlock scenario. That’s upside, but not “must-own” upside given execution and political risk. **What would change my mind** * ROIC > WACC with proof it’s durable.

A Space for Traders Who Enter Too Soon, Sell Too Early, and Want to Master the Right Timing","Every trader knows that feeling — you spot the setup early, take your position, the price drifts lower, you average down, wait… and then cut it right before it finally moves. You weren’t wrong on the company — just **too early** on the entry. That’s the idea behind **“EarlyBets”**, a space for traders and investors who consistently identify great setups before the crowd but struggle with timing. The focus is **value vesting** — developing patience, conviction, and structure recognition so being early becomes an edge instead of a curse. Here’s what the community would revolve around: * **Early Entry Diaries:** Sharing trades where you bought too soon or while price was falling, and breaking down how to spot when accumulation is actually complete. * **Timing Analytics:** Members posting examples of *when the right time to buy would have been* — so we learn to separate early conviction from premature entry. * **Behavioral Lessons:** Understanding why we enter before confirmation, panic during dips, and sell before catalysts arrive. * **Catalyst Watchlist:** Tracking stocks where news hits *after* early buyers have already given up. The idea is to build a group that refines the art of **entering early but correctly** — catching opportunities while they’re still undiscovered, yet waiting for the chart and volume to confirm that timing has finally aligned.

T,1oeim3v,ValueInvesting,WeRide WRD- A longer term value play on International autonomous Pony Ai is a Heck No,"I have been following WeRide for a while now, I’m still perplexed at the Pony Ai rally while WeRide drifts. After reading the GrizzlyResearch Report, which I highly recommend and reviewing the sell side analysis from JP Morgan and Citi I felt that WeRide was actually meeting targets and growing but the message was not resonating. I reached out to their IR department and they replied quickly and were receptive to feedback. Q2 they did a much better job communicating their respective achievements and growth ambitions and you can see that improvement in messaging in their MD &A , read that and it’s clear that they have an effective strategy that is just beginning to produce sting results. On top of that WeRide finally has their secondary listing approved for Hong Kong. This is not the same wild times of the 2010s where Carson Block was blowing up the Sino Forests of the world. The catalyst is upon us-incremental index buying, regulator legitimacy and access to additional scale and financing. It will allow WeRide to build out their software while employing the hardware to scale up their autonomous business. This is not a Grab Holdings or Uber Eats model, WeRide is focused on dominating the autonomous stack. The company has the ability to be what High Speed Rail in China is now compared to 20 years ago. The size, growth and scale of this market without the same capital outlay and more importantly direct government control make it unbelievably compelling. Uber invested $100MM in May and with Tesla and Waymo focused on North America, the runway for WeRide is long. In 2024 WeRide flashed signs of concerns with large capital outlays and compression in revenue. I am glad to see the 2025 narrative has shifted with 60% growth in revenue and close to 800% increase in autonomous revenue. Though we have seen an uptick in the stock price over the last few months I believe this is early innings for WeRide. The autonomous focus is where the real catalyst for growth is with expansion approvals in Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and the Middle East. The belief is the market also missed the message with respect to the partnership with Nvidia and Lenovo. They have established a platform to expand machine learning while incorporating it in the hardware used in the field. Just In Time information for instant usage allowing them to grow organically as opposed to Bolt Ons like Grab Holdings plans to pursue.

T,1occ01u,ValueInvesting,REIT in Strategic Alternatives with 38% to 100% Upside,"Franklin Street Properties ($FSP) is a small office REIT that has been slowly and unofficially liquidating for the past 5 years. Finally, in May of this year, they announced a review of strategic alternatives: “The review will include a range of potential strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company, a sale of assets, and a refinancing of existing indebtedness, among others.” I have been following FSP for over a year now, and the stock has traded below my estimate of NAV for the majority of this time. During the market decline in April, the stock dropped to $1.36, but I decided not to buy due to being uncertain of how long the gap between price and value would take to close. A month later, they announced the strategic review, and the stock shot up to almost $2 again; now the stock is back below $1.50 after stating clear intentions of selling out. Let’s see how the market is currently valuing FSP with the stock at $1.45. [https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties) At current prices, the market is valuing FSP at over a 12% cap rate and $79/sqft. At first glance, this seems a deeply conservative valuation for the whole portfolio. Recently, two office REITs got acquisition offers; one is Orion Properties ($ONL) for $2.75 per share for a total enterprise value of \~$650 million, at a 12.9% cap rate, $85/sqft, and an ABR multiple of 4.38x. City Office REIT will be acquired at an enterprise value of \~$1.05 billion, at a \~10% cap rate, \~$194/sqft, and an ABR multiple of \~6.2x. FSP has the lowest valuation per sqft and as an ABR multiple, but a slightly lower cap rate than ONL. Generally, FSP’s buildings are better than ONL and worse than CIO, but it's trading cheaper than both. FSP occupancy is around 67% compared to ONL's 77%. I think FSP's buildings could be leased up to the same occupancy as ONL if the required CapEx is spent; this represents upside for a prospective acquirer, more so considering that rent would go straight to the bottom line due to operating leverage in office buildings. **Sell-Out Scenarios:** This is my thought experiment about the possible scenarios for an acquiring firm. How good of a deal will they get? 1. $2.00/share: at this price, the acquirer would get a pretty attractive deal; they’d be buying decent office buildings at $90/sqft and over a 10% cap rate with the possibility of putting up capital to lease an extra 500k sqft and get to a reasonable 77-80% occupancy rate and maybe dispose of the obsolete buildings at $25-50 per sqft. 2. $2.20/share: I chose this price simply because it represents a 10% cap rate. It still gives the prospective buyer a reasonable upside if they can get occupancy close to 80%. Even if occupancy doesn’t realize, buying that group of buildings under $100/sqft is more than reasonable. 3. $3.00/share: This would be the best-case scenario, with limited upside to the acquiring firm. It is unlikely but not unreasonable. I reviewed the portfolio property by property about a year ago, and I got to a NAV of about $2.50. The properties that have sold since my first estimate have above my initial estimate, so my estimate might be on the conservative side. I believe that the company could get $2.50/share if they liquidated on an individual basis, and it could be realized in 2-3 years given that there are a total of only 14 separate properties. **How Long Will It Take to Sell Out?** While I don’t have an exact answer, I’ll evaluate it in 2 ways: 1. The property-by-property liquidation should take 2-3 years. Net Leased Office Properties ($NLOP) has sold 20 office properties in the last 2 years. A 2-3 year time frame for 14 properties seems more than reasonable. 2. If they are reaching out to prospective buyers, they should receive an offer sooner than the estimated time of liquidating individually. I want to address FSP’s debt quickly. All of their maturities are due April 1st of 2026. I believe the creditors will collaborate and extend the maturities because: 1. NOI covers the interest expense by 2x. NOI being $45 million and interest expense $22.5 million, while having $30 million in cash. 2. If equity is wiped out, the creditors will own the office space at $51/sqft. If the company files for bankruptcy, the equity holders will likely get a piece of the pie. As a creditor, getting SOFR + 4% on real estate with a DSCR of 2.0 and my borrower having more than enough to pay interest for 1 year sounds like a good position to be in. **If it takes 3 years to liquidate, what will be my CAGR at current prices?** [https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties](https://cristianleon1200.substack.com/p/franklin-street-properties) Currently, Franklin Street Properties is trading well below its liquidation value; considering their strategic alternatives process, I believe FSP can yield a satisfactory return with limited downside.

T,1ogt0ad,investing,"Question for UK based members: Advice on holding Funds in a GIA (ETF vs OEIC, and Accumulation vs Income)","Hello folks, I would greatly appreciate any advice that some of you might be kind enough to share. I recently inherited £100,000 from a relative who very sadly passed away. I have maxed out both my ISA and SIPP contributions for this year, but I want to get this money working for me in a Fund right away. Over the coming years, I can slowly move this money into my tax-sheltered accounts, but for now my only option is to have it in a GIA. I would like to keep things as simple and efficient as possible from a Tax perspective. From the research I have done so far: it looks as if the best way of achieving this (inside a GIA) would be to buy an OEIC that distributes income, such as the Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund (VFGAIGI). One reason for my thinking that an OEIC would be preferable to an ETF (inside a GIA), is that an ETF would have ERI (Excess reportable income) to report each year, however an OEIC will not have ERI to report. Is this correct? The reason that I think that a distributing income fund would be preferable, is that if and when I sell any of the fund, my CGT calculations would be much more straight-forward. Please correct me on this if I am wrong, but my research so far seems to show the following: In a Distributing income fund, I will receive my dividends and pay tax on them each year. I can then choose to either keep them for myself, or manually re-invest them into the fund. And that is the end of that. However, in an Accumulating fund, I will still have to pay tax on the dividends that will accumulate in the fund each year. When I come to sell part/all of the fund in the years down the line, in order to calculate the CGT correctly, I would have to keep a record of every dividend that I received and paid tax on. These dividends would then be added to the base price of the fund, and this would in turn reduce my CGT accordingly. While this doesn’t seem too arduous a task – it is another still thing to remember, and another calculation to make. Would I be correct in thinking that if I choose to manually reinvest all of my dividends in a Distributing income fund, then I would ultimately be in the same position (financially) as I would be if I had chosen an accumulating fund – but with the bonus of a very simple CGT calculation later on when I come to sell the fund? Asides from this, are there any other differences between having an accumulating or income OEIC in a GIA? I have also done some reading on Equalisation for when I come to calculate CGT later on. As this is basically a return of Capital which is included in a Dividend payment; on the Tax statement that I'd receive from my investment platform (I'm considering Vanguard Investor) - would this show the Dividend amount, minus the Equalisation payment? Thereby ensuring that I only pay Dividend tax in my self-assessment on the actual amount of dividend I have earned while in the fund, and not on the return of capital/equalisation? I would be very grateful for any advice, and thanks to all for reading.",1,3,2025-10-26 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ogt0ad/question_for_uk_based_members_advice_on_holding/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.291390,0.5,$T,0.8,[],['dividend'],0.6057142857142856,Communication Services

T,1o5hdxa,wallstreetbets,$UUUU is still THE play: 300k YOLO (with DD),"Okay I know what you're all thinking. >iMaGiNe BuYiNg a StOcK uP 300% aT aLl tImE hIgHs 🤡 Normally that’s the right call. Buying high with no new news is how you blow up your port. But if every few weeks something new happens that strengthens the bull case, and if there is new information and upcoming catalysts, then there is a lot of room to run. And I have such a strong conviction that I put a 300k YOLO on it. Here's why: # Top reasons $UUUU is still THE play right now: 1. The U.S. is finally cutting off its dependence on China’s rare earths: China just tightened export rules on rare earth *production technology*, not just the minerals. That’s the part the West can’t replace easily. Meanwhile, **Energy Fuels runs the only commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in the United States**. 2. The DOE meeting this Tuesday could be a real catalyst: The Department of Energy is holding the first **Defense Production Act Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain Consortium** meeting on **October 14**. This is the group that will decide how to rebuild the U.S. nuclear and critical mineral supply network. **Energy Fuels fits produce both uranium and rare earths.** If they’re part of this consortium or get named in the follow-up, that could open the door to future government funding or contracts. 3. The U.S. government is literally taking equity stakes in critical mineral companies and are SCRAMBLING to get more partnerships done: The next logical step is uranium and rare earths, where Energy Fuels leads. A partnership or stake from the administration and we are $30+ overnight. 4. The Pentagon just kicked off a $1 billion critical minerals stockpile: The Department of Defense are building a domestic reserve for key materials like cobalt, antimony, scandium, and rare earths. Energy Fuels is one of the few that can produce these materials domestically at scale. 5. The company is funded and ready so risk of additional share offering is super low since they have no debt issues and no need to scramble for cash. # So what are the risks? 1. China and the U.S. suddenly make a deal and China floods the market with cheap rare earths. Could it happen? Maybe. Will it? No. The U.S. isn’t going to keep letting China hold this over their head. It’s literally a national security issue, and the Section 232 investigation report that is supposed to come out later this month will support that. The government *HAS* to build domestic supply. 2. Short term profit taking: The stock has gone straight vertical so I definitely admit that people will look to lock in gains here and there. However, I don’t see anyone dumping heavy until major catalysts play out (like the DOE meeting, potential government deals, Section 232 investigation, etc.). **Sources / Recent News:** * [China tightens rare earth export controls, escalating trade tensions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-10-09/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Beijing defends rare earth curbs, blames U.S. for rising tensions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-its-rare-earth-export-controls-are-legitimate-2025-10-12/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Trump says he’s weighing a massive increase in tariffs on Chinese imports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-weighing-massive-increase-tariffs-chinese-imports-no-reason-meet-with-2025-10-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Pentagon launching $1B critical minerals stockpiling program](https://www.kmjnow.com/2025/10/12/pentagon-plans-1b-critical-minerals-buying-spree/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Energy Fuels produces first heavy rare earth oxides at White Mesa Mill](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [Energy Fuels says it can produce six rare earths now subject to China’s export bans](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-says-it-can-produce-six-rare-earths-subject-chinese-export-controls/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * [U.S. offers to buy stakes in Australian critical minerals companies](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-offers-buy-stakes-australian-critical-minerals-companies-2025-10-02/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) **TLDR:** $UUUU is the only U.S. company producing both uranium and heavy rare earths right as the government is scrambling to cut off dependence on China, launching a $1B stockpile, holding a DOE meeting on nuclear energy Tuesday, and wrapping up the Section 232 national security report - all catalysts that can drive the price higher. **Positions: 1,505 $24 calls exp 10/31 @ $1.95** because the biggest catalysts haven’t even dropped yet.

T,1okiv23,investing,Why I care more about Google than NVDA,"I’m paying more attention to Google than Nvidia right now, and here’s why. Google just announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing. Their new algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” ran on their Willow 105‑qubit chip and reportedly achieved a 13,000× speed‑up over the best classical supercomputer for a targeted computation. That is a huge shift if it holds up. What really catches my eye is how this could reshape AI compute infrastructure. Today most of the AI narrative is about GPUs, data centers and training massive models. Nvidia dominates in that world. But if quantum hardware becomes practical at scale, the entire compute stack – from chips to cloud to software – could pivot. Google already links Quantum Echoes to real‑world applications like molecular modeling and materials science, even drug discovery. In contrast, Nvidia’s story is brilliant and likely still valid in the near term, but it might be structured around the current paradigm of GPU‑first compute. If the paradigm shifts, Nvidia might face more competition or structural limit. Meanwhile, Google is quietly moving on the underlying compute frontier. Their blog says this demonstration is a step toward “real‑world applications of quantum computing” and not just academic fireworks. From an investment perspective this means one of two things: either Google’s quantum efforts take years to pay off (in which case Nvidia remains the safer bet) or we’re at the beginning of a compute inflection and Google is underpriced for the long term. Given how many institutions are locked into GPU chains already, the transition won’t be overnight, but the potential upside looks significant.",342,125,2025-10-31 02:21:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1okiv23/why_i_care_more_about_google_than_nvda/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.281188,0.45,$T,0.8,[],[],0.9999999999999999,Communication Services
T,1oimuw1,ValueInvesting,Peter Lynch was right: The retail investor’s edge is seeing what Wall Street doesn’t,"I just reread One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch. The first time I read this I was 15 years old, and every time I do (at least once a year), I’m amazed that his message is still largely ignored in the age of algorithms and social media hype. Lynch’s core idea: > We don’t need: 500-assumption DCF models, 200-page sell-side reports, Follow the institutional consensus. What we do need is curiosity + common sense. # The key lessons from this book are mainly investing in what you know, doing your own research and classify companies by category. This last one is crucial: knowing the category prevents confusing a cyclical business with a growth company, or a turnaround with a value trap. And the last one, price matters. Even a great company can be a bad investment if you overpay. # One quote that sums it up: > Most people look at the chart. Lynch looked at the business. # Discussion question: In 2025, with algorithms, high-frequency trading, and social media-driven narratives… **Does Lynch’s principle of using the retail advantage to spot opportunities before Wall Street still hold?** Or has the market become too efficient?

T,1o35dfg,financialindependence,Year Update after $1M: Laid Off,"Hello! I wanted to give a year update since I’ve last posted my Reddit post about me hitting the [$1M Checkmark (a culmination of lessons from Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1g0t6e0/1m_checkmark_a_culmination_of_lessons_from_reddit/). For context, I’m 33M in VHCOL area. What’s happened since then? * I got laid off in February! I was on a snowboarding trip in Japan when I got the email, informing me of the layoff. I went to bed after the email, went snowboarding for a bit, and went to the onsen. I hated my tech job and while I was hoping to get laid off, it still hurt. The severance package was generous though: 8.5 months of pay, 8 months of health insurance, my vesting RSUs. * I got into a snowboarding accident. I went 50 miles per hour and tomahawked into the powder. I was rushed to the emergency room, got some fentanyl, and came out with a bruised rib. Luckily, it was a month after being laid off, so I had insurance which reduced the bill from $10k to $3k. * I panicked during the whole tariff thing and sold a lot of my portfolio.. Luckily, I went back in pretty early, but it also made me more motivated to go job hunting again. I’ve made a series of bad and good investing choices: lost $45k in OPEN (I bought at $3.7, sold at $2, my initial position was $100k). As of 10/9, the price is $8, and I would be up an extra $116k. What did I learn? **Don’t panic..** * I decided to go back to my roots (before tech) and went back into private tutoring and SAT test preparation. It’s been quite satisfying for me and I get only about $330 a week in cash. It’s been a great mental shift as.. I use this cash as an excuse to eat healthier (I buy Sweetgreen salads for lunch every weekday..) * Job market is tough. I think if I was in a H1B situation or did not have my severance, I would’ve been more panicky and filled with more anxiety. I did get a job in August; it does not pay as much as it did when I was in tech (details below), but I’m actually quite happy with the work. I have a micro-manager, but financial independence has made me more confident and I feel empowered to say no to dumb requests. * I still go to therapy but I feel happier. I’ve told my therapist that I feel like I live life with more intention and am overall happier. It’s interesting because I am willing to spend money on Sweetgreen salads only because I do tutoring now for it, but I made more when I was in tech but never wanted to spend it. * I’ve been thinking a lot more about volunteering and where my money goes if I die since my snowboarding accident. I haven’t done any of the beneficiary stuff mainly because I don’t think I have anyone I would leave it to. But as I get older, I need to think about my will and whatnot. To do: Read Die with Zero. * Despite all of that (layoffs, bad financial mistakes, big life events), I am currently at $1.35M, which is 62% of my FI goal. I do need to recalculate my budget based off of my current spending habits. But I’ve already decided that my current situation is pretty much coastFIRE. Why? * My current work is quite interesting and I like the work and the stakeholders (for once, they also like me). * My company offers 1 month sabbaticals every 5 years, so it feels well balanced with PTO and workload. * I’ve decided to just work for as long as my dog is alive (she’s 5 right now, she’s expected to live until 18); my main reasoning is that she’s my only family and it’d be hard to just do my “live abroad for a few years” thing while she’s around. **Laid Off Specific Info** FAANG Salary TC: $287K ($209K Base) New Job TC: $158K (No RSU / Stock) **NW Breakdown (Last Year’s)** Brokerage: $469K ($340K) Roth IRA: $164K ($106K) FAANG 401k: $692K ($550K)| Healthcare 401k: $6K (New) HSA: $11K ($4K) Emergency Fund: $18.5k ($15.5K) Churning Points: 1M (60% UR, 40% MR) Student Loan: $6k at 3.15% **Portfolio Breakdown (Last Year’s)** VTSAX or equivalent 57% (82%) Individual stocks (GOOG, NVDA, NBIS, ASTS, RDDT): 41% (12%) Bonds 2% (3%) Cash 0% (3%) **Income History** I worked a lot of part time jobs from 2011 to 2015 but didn’t file taxes so.. the income history is missing there. 2015: 13k 2016: 26k 2017: 42k 2018: 75k 2019: 115k 2020: 135k 2021: 170k 2022: 181k 2023: 266k 2024: 353k **401K Contribution History** 2018: Employer Match: $0.8k, 401k: $5.4k, After Tax 401k: $7.9k 2019: Employer Match: $3.9k, 401k: $19k, After Tax 401k: $23k Rollover from other company 401k (2016-2018): $21.2k 2020: Employer Match: $4.4k, 401k: $19.5k, After Tax 401k: $27.5k 2021: Employer Match: $5.5, 401k: $19.5k, After Tax 401k: $28350 2022: Employer Match: $10.25k, 401k: $20.5k, After Tax 401k: $29k 2023: Employer Match: $11.25k, 401k: $22.5k 2024: Employer Match: $11.5k, 401k: $23k, After Tax 401k: $34.5k 2025: Employer Match: $11.75k, 401k: $23,5k, After Tax 401k: $11.1k **401K Sources (Total now $694k as of 10/09/25):** Roth In Plan Conversion: 42.76% Pre Tax: 36.87% Employer Match: 13.15% Rollover: 7.17% Roth Rollover: 0.05% **Milestones of Savings:** 2019: 100k 2020: 200k 2021: 300k 2022: 400k 2023: 500k, 600k, 2024: 700k, 800k, 900k, 1M 2025: 1.1M, 1.2M, 1.3M **Links** Year by Year Expenses [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHUBjlPyMSfXC28NqFPiDhceNfCrG\_FCuzLkr2Nga1Y/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHUBjlPyMSfXC28NqFPiDhceNfCrG_FCuzLkr2Nga1Y/edit?usp=sharing)",234,96,2025-10-10 16:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1o35dfg/year_update_after_1m_laid_off/,2025-11-07 16:44:36.096850,0.45,$T,0.5,[],[],0.9999999999999999,Communication Services
T,1of2gyb,wallstreetbets,How I plan for $Grab to build me generational wealth,"Note: No returns are guaranteed. This is not financial advice. I posted a yolo prior to the stock running 30% and now I am outlining my plan to build wealth off of the stock, provided it rises to my desired price range, with some added DD. How $GRAB is going to help me build generational wealth over the coming years (to the tune of a possible 5-10k a month in two years off of less than 50k now): Quick note before I start: I posted more in-depth DD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/LDXtJgE4DX I’d recommend checking it out and also looking through the comments; I addressed a lot of negative sentiment on Grab that might be helpful to read before commenting here. Many investors are bullish on Grab stock to different extents, but my personal price target is $12.00 by the end of 2027. That’s a >50B dollar valuation. What’s our path to that point? Grab has greater growing potential relative to its current price. The company is in a unique position in Southeast Asia, where different markets they operate in have differing levels of maturity. They have 40% population usage in Singapore, but less than 10% average among all the other areas it services. I believe Grab is priced as if the entire market it operates in was as mature as Singapore. In Singapore, some are pointing to slowing growth, higher prices than competitors, and stagnating market share in the ride hailing business. This is also a problem in Thailand. Those are all concerns, but they aren’t valid for a number of reasons: 1.) Grab has a portfolio of businesses it’s sustaining. Over the past 2 years it has had slightly higher prices than the one-dimensional ridesharing companies. But Grab’s current model isn’t to out-price its competitors in rideshare; it’s to build an integrated, cohesive ecosystem that draws users in, and then they can adapt to the entire system. Grab is an entirely different company than those other rideshare apps like Bolt or others. It’s not one-dimensional. Grab is building multiple revenue streams, that, once they are all profitable (and they are on track to rocket into profitability this and next quarter), allows them to seriously outprice its competitors relative to convenience and quality. So, Grabs competitors’ prices aren’t a concern long term. 2.) Grab is in an emerging market of SEA. Grab’s growth trajectory far exceeds the economic growth rates of most Southeast Asian markets, especially outside Singapore. While Singapore’s GDP grows roughly 2–3% annually, Grab’s regional revenue expanded 23% year-over-year in 2025, with particularly strong momentum in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, where digital adoption and underbanked populations remain high. Singapore already has near-universal smartphone penetration and one of the world’s most developed financial systems, meaning Grab’s market there is largely mature. Plus, their financial services have less margin for growth. In contrast, Grab’s penetration in larger, faster-growing economies like Indonesia and Vietnam is still expanding rapidly, making Singapore a stabilized base, not a representation of the company’s overall growth potential. Keep in mind that Grab is operating profitably in Singapore but is also heavily investing into their other services. Prices will come down and margins will likely increase in Singapore. Grab reported revenue of US$819 million in Q2 2025 (up 23% YoY) and an Adjusted EBITDA of US$109 million (up 69% YoY). Operating margin metrics are turning positive: the company’s operating margin is reported as +4.06% (TTM) versus -3.40% at end-2024. Efficiencies are increasing and prices will continue to drop. So, Grab is likely undervalued compared to its growth potential. I’m looking for a revenue increase beat on this earnings. If EPS is anywhere above $.03, the stock will probably go parabolic. But mainly I am looking for serious revenue beat. Now this is pretty surface level DD, there’s lots of other reasons + data that are bullish for grab. Grab is a likely 2x play over 2-3 years, so it’s not like it’s the next PLTR. But I do believe it has serious growth in its future. So what’s the actual plan, though? How does an investor build wealth for the long term using FA, TA, option, shares, etc? Here’s how I’m doing it: I opened 185 6-7 call debit spreads expiring on 11/14. This is exclusively an earning play. I believe earnings will beat, likely sending us over $6 and into the mid-upper sixes range. My breakeven is 6.15 on those contracts. This is a risky play, but if it hits, it likely hits big. 5-15k profit, depending on if it expires between 6.30 and 7. I’m looking to 3x or 4x my money and then dump it into 7C for 12/27. My next strategy is a 10-12C spread for 1/21/28. these cost about .21 now, and I believe that Grab has a serious chance of being above 12 at expiration. That’s an amazing RR for how bullish I am on the stock (890% potential return). I own 200 contracts, resulting in a potential profit of 35k. I plan to double my position in that before year end as well, for a potential 70k on a 9k position. If the grab earnings play hits, I will be able to triple this position. 7C for 12/27 is the main position for my Grab growth plan. 7C will likely be deep ITM by 12/27, but I’m not planning to push to higher strikes or longer dates, most likely. This will be eventually a high delta, high capital position that I plan to sell when it hits 12 (or exercise at expiry if not). Ideally I will build this position over the fall into over 200 contracts, allowing me to own 20,00 shares. At the beginning of the 2028 year, if Grab is above 12, I will have 12,000 shares that I’m up 30% on (can’t exercise 20,000 at 7 without an extra 60k in capital) and 75k profit from the 10-12 spreads. Roughly 175k in profits total. Total shares if all profits are reinvested: 18,250 (best case) I plan to wheel these shares, gathering me $5,000-$8,000 every month. Using technical analysis and a keen eye on the company, I plan for this to be my main source of income for the coming decade. Total capital up front: $3,000 for 6-7C spread (you obviously don’t need this) $30,000 for 7C 12/2027 @1.60 $9,000 for 10-12C 1/21/28 @.21 You can scale this any way you want, but I think the higher delta, likely deep ITM at expiration 7C combined with the smaller position, but insane RR spreads, will be one of the main drivers of generational wealth for me in the future.",76,100,2025-10-24 16:32:32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of2gyb,2025-11-07 16:42:40.561278,0.45,$T,1.0,['GRAB'],"['bull', 'earnings', 'yolo', 'rocket', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.94,Communication Services
AMZN,1ohtjlv,pennystocks,MSAI + AMZN? Why I believe something big is brewing:,"After extensive research I am all the more convinced this is a sleeping monster. Read this: (oct14,2025) https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=5374384416805784&symbol=MSAI This is a press release from MSAI outlining how they are working with (direct quotes here) ""a global distribution leader"" ""a global leader in logistics and e-commerce"" who does that make you think of? Digging deeper the press release states: ""The customer—a global leader in logistics and e-commerce—has begun deploying MultiSensor AI's solutions across key U.S. distribution and fulfillment centers. These solutions are integrated with the MSAI Connect platform to deliver real-time visibility, early fault detection, and predictive maintenance insights across high-throughput operations."" Who does that make you think of? Who fits that description? 6 days later after thier press release, on October 20, the stock surged under 22m volume. The single most voluminous trading day to that date in MSAIs history. I immediately opened a position upon reading this, but I had to know more. Looking further back into their press releases, I found that they have recently onboarded a certain Luke Grice-Lowe as Director of International Business Development. What's so special about Mr. Grice-Lowe, you ask? Well so did I. Turns out, he just so happened to work at Amazon prior to MSAI. Turns out, he worked there for 9 years!!! Turns out, his position at Amazon was GLOBAL RELIABILITY ENGINEER. Turns out he left in good standing with his coworkers. https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7006062915463193&symbol=MSAI Now by this point I have increased my position size to (roughly) 25% of my entire portfolio. But I have to know more. I have to keep digging. In comes the $14million private placement. The key words are already right there. This isn't your typical dillution. This is $14million worth of shares and warrants being sold off the lit market to a private investor. Now, MSAI is roughly 15ish days away from a NASDAQ notice of non-compliance. HOWEVER. The terms to this private placement don't even have it CLOSING until October 27, and the funds from the private placement aren't expected to settle until December. TO ME, this says MSAI is either confident that they will soon be meeting NASDAQ listing requirements, or confident that NASDAQ will grant them an extension. https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7870007585310751&symbol=MSAI Now all this brings us to today, OCT 27. the stock acted very typically until 12:30pm CST. At which point (I am assuming due to the closing of the private offering) the share price absolutely flatlined at 0.7701 for the rest of the day. The effect of this was that now the lowest ask on the open market was .0835. no one was selling all damn day (not literally). I believe this has set off a series of events in the future of this stock. First off, the cost to borrow today absolutely spiked from ~6 to 58(!!!). Second, it created an anchor zone in the price. Thirdly, I believe it created a vacuum in the supply around 0.77. i am eager to see what happens when there is any tiny piece of a catalyst (which I believe there soon will be, as earnings is on Nov. 11) and no shares available to buy in the .77 support zone. The fact that the private placement closed today, and that it was a private placement, and with how strange the price action was today, has me extremely intrigued. I have dug so deep into this I'm sure I am forgetting things. I will add them in the comments. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON THIS Edit-: it would seem according to preliminary research that the last mention of a reverse split was April 16, 2024 in ""standard boilerplate not directly relating to an actionable stock split"". I left a comment with a preliminary grok search explaining in more detail. So presumably there are no current plans to do so. Edit-: here is more on Mr Grice-Lowe. Asking Google AI about his performance during his tenure at Amazon: "" In a LinkedIn post reflecting on his departure, he spoke positively about his time at Amazon and was met with well-wishes from his peers, suggesting he left on good terms."" https://share.google/aimode/yYOaGCyzMYaBYhjOI",143,188,2025-10-27 23:06:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1ohtjlv/msai_amzn_why_i_believe_something_big_is_brewing/,2025-11-07 16:40:15.687690,0.45,$AMZN,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'rally', 'support', 'volume', 'split']",0.9285714285714285,Consumer Cyclical

This is funny, because the narrative is basically “no one uses PayPal anymore, everybody just uses Apple Pay.” Reality looks different. – Profits +12% YoY. Analysts expected about $1.20/share, PayPal printed \~$1.34/share. – Revenue only +7%, yes. But revenue isn’t the main story here anymore. – Management is killing low-margin stuff (unbranded checkout, Braintree, etc.) and going all-in on the branded PayPal button. Result: total payment volume slows a bit, but the *profitable* part grows. • Branded checkout +5% YoY • Venmo +20% YoY – Transaction margin dollars +6% to \~$3.87B vs \~$3.78B expected. This is basically “how much money is left to PayPal after paying Visa/Mastercard etc.” → that’s brand strength. – Active users are actually UP \~1%. I’m talking active users, not dead accounts. Then two other points: 1. Management raised guidance for 2025. The CEO (Chriss) has been conservative so far, so raising guidance means they think something good is really happening. 2. They dropped some serious catalysts: • Partnership with OpenAI → you’ll be able to check out instantly using your PayPal wallet inside ChatGPT • Stablecoin + Alphabet deals already announced before • First small dividend for shareholders So for me, 2025 is clearly the transition year, and 2026 is the proof year: can higher-margin checkout + Venmo + commerce inside ChatGPT + ads turn into real money? On ads: PayPal doesn’t just know “what you click,” it knows what you actually bought. That means merchants can show offers to the right buyers inside the PayPal checkout and only pay if the product is actually sold. That’s a very different ad model vs Meta/Google and could be a real edge starting 2026.",53,74,2025-10-28 21:23:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oilx2c/paypal_after_earnings_still_dead_huh/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.048624,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'volume', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.9285714285714285,Communication Services
T,1oqcnu5,stocks,Tesla says shareholders approve Musk’s $1 trillion pay plan with over 75% voting in favor,"Tesla said shareholders voted in favor of CEO Elon Musk’s almost $1 trillion pay plan, with 75% support. Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September. Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against it. Results of the vote were announced on Thursday at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. The package for Musk, already the world’s richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he’s made publicly since early 2024. The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%. Musk would receive the first tranche of stock if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla’s current market cap is $1.54 trillion. The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla’s value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package. Other goals tied to the pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD subscriptions​, 1 million bots delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement. The proposed plan doesn’t specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as “FSD Supervised” in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don’t require human supervision on board. Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion. As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals. There are also a list of “covered events” in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones. Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to “international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,” that could hamper the company’s ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line. Shareholders voted on the plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk’s earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. Musk appealed that ruling and the matter will be decided by the Delaware State Supreme Court. In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company. He’s also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.

They specifically stated: >“We’re prepared to utilise the full capacity once Q3 results are out if the share price still doesn’t reflect intrinsic value.” That line says a lot. Management clearly believes the coming results will speak for themselves, and they’re ready to buy aggressively if the market doesn’t recognize it. **2) Strong Cash Position** Gorilla currently holds about $107M in free cash and $120M in restricted cash (around $227M total). There’s no mention of dilution anywhere in the release. They also mention plans to secure non-dilutive funding for future projects, another strong signal that this company is well-capitalized and focused on protecting shareholders. **3) Timing Lines Up Perfectly** The company is in a blackout period right now (they can’t buy shares or announce major updates before earnings). That ends mid-November, exactly when Q3 results are expected. Once earnings are released, they’ll be free to: Announce business updates or new contracts Begin executing the buyback Follow through on earlier project milestones It’s a perfect setup for a sentiment and volume shift. **4) SEC Submission on Market Manipulation** Gorilla also plans to submit data to the SEC about what it believes to be aggressive shorting and possible naked short activity once the U.S. government reopens. That’s not just talk. It’s a clear sign that management intends to address what’s been holding the stock back and create a fairer market environment for investors. **5) Underlying Fundamentals Keep Strengthening** CEO Jay Chandan highlighted several operational milestones that justify their confidence: The $1.4B Freyr AI Data Centre contract The launch of post-quantum secure SD-WAN New business wins across Asia-Pacific Existing partnerships with global technology players These are tangible achievements that build recurring revenue and real growth visibility. **Bottom Line** This release reads like a company that knows exactly where it’s heading and has the balance sheet to back it up. With Q3 earnings, a $20M buyback, and action against short manipulation all lining up for November, Gorilla could be at the start of a major re-rating moment. If the numbers and guidance are strong, this next report won’t just be another update. It could be a turning point for the market value of $GRRR. **Source:** [Official Press Release – Gorilla Increases Share Repurchase Program to $20 Million](https://investors.gorilla-technology.com/gorilla-technology-increases-share-repurchase-buyback-programme-to-20-million/)",22,8,2025-10-28 09:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oi4w5a/why_i_think_grrrs_q3_could_be_a_knockout_quarter/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.815998,0.45,$T,0.9,['GRRR'],"['earnings', 'volume', 'market cap', 'revenue']",0.9228571428571428,Communication Services
T,1olrk7u,ValueInvesting,Mandatory Novo Nordisk thread,"Sup guys, You might remember me from the previous mandatory LVMH thread when I called LVMH at around \~$450 4/5 months ago. [Mandatory LVMH thread : r/ValueInvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1lfq216/comment/njtclhb/) This time around, this sub is due for another NOVO thread (yes, it’s barely the 100th one this week). To summarize : * People calling for a better competitor → NOVO (LVMH) is cooked, LLY (HERMÈS) has better pricing power and they’re the REAL obesity players (as opposed to the “fake” pharma player? I suppose?). I’m sure you see where I’m going. People are completely ignoring their leadership in the diabetes sector.. * Price is giga down from ATH, the dividend is great, the PER is well below the historical average, price is sitting at support, and it’s on the verge of breaking out from this giga painful downtrend (drawing the lines here—they speak to me). * Company's financial metrics are pumping but their stock’s PA isn’t. This is extremely sus; the market is irrationally pricing out future growth. The decorrelation is huge and unsustainable. * I think their aggressive PFIZER counter-move is part of a broader aggressive strat by the new management. I expect their earnings to beat expectations—they’re clearly feeling confident. The downside appears very limited to me. If the stock was doing well, people would find reasons to buy it. Now that's it's doing terrible, people find reasons to not buy it. In my humble opinion, this downtrend is mostly due to transitory effects (mostly DJT tariffs threats). This stock will fly in the next 5 years guaranted. Moreover, this market is growing at incredible pace and they're targetting new non US markets. This will pay off in the near future. Good luck!

T,1o3iy4l,investing,Drawdowns are Normal and Expected,"Saw a lot of chatter about the downturn in the market with the China tariff noise. As with all investing, objective should drive your view of today’s events, and moving forward. We tend to see multiple 5% drawdowns a year with on average a 10% drawdown occurring every 3 years. We have not seen a sustained 5% drawdown since liberation day. Historically speaking, today happening shouldn’t surprise anyone. We will have drawdowns (based from 1990 - March 2025) in years with strong market performance, with a -8.7% average drawdown recorded in up markets, with an average -13.7% drawdown on average years. Recessions naturally dramatically bring this figure up per the source below. Similar to what we saw happen after liberation day, where stocks rebounded to new peaks, similarly in a non-recession environment the average “peak to trough” (high point of the market cycle to the bottom point of the market cycle) lasts 89 days and then recovers on average to the prior high water mark in 109 days. Median figure bring the above down to 43 days peak to trough and 109 days to recover back to the previous peak. The downside is that during a recession, the peak to trough is on average 351 days, while getting back to the prior peaks requires 715 days on average. This shows us that recessions are more downward immediately over the course of a year, while it can take 2+ years to recover from that last peak. Of course I know some of you will point out the 1999 crash that took 14 years to recover from, and that is a valid point and a key part of recent modern history. We need to be able to compare present day sky high p/e’s with a similar story of today’s tech companies with AI, while also realizing that even if we have a major crash, long term holders are going to benefit from buying down the average share price to then reap the rewards on the way back up. Just don’t get too under your skis and try to become a guru by perfectly timing the market. And for the love of god, stop pulling funds out because the other candidate won. Left, right, it doesn’t matter. Over the long run buying and holding is the best strategy you can make, even if you buy at an all time high. Solar did better under Trump 1 and oil/gas did better under Biden. It never works out how we plan it with administrations coming in talking about wanting to push certain sectors. Moral of the story? Just keep buying if you’re a long term holder. If you’re getting older, you likely want to introduce more “safe” and “stable” assets into your mix. A 20/80 for a 75 year old who expects to live 10-15 more years is much more suitable and would provide more utility to this age demographic versus a 25 year old who can fairly safely go 100% equities and weather the volatility along the way.

T,1oiskfi,ValueInvesting,Chubb (CB) at 12x: Quality the Market Forgot to Overpay For,"The market has decided that safety is expensive. Visa trades at 30x earnings, Apple at 40x, Costco at 50x. These are mature, rock-solid businesses, but investors are paying nosebleed multiples for the privilege of sleeping soundly. Meanwhile, Chubb Insurance, which literally sells safety for a living, sits at 12x earnings with a 15% ROE, and the market collectively yawns. This is either a reasonable discount for a capital-intensive, cyclical business, or it's a meaningful mispricing. I think it's the latter. **What Chubb Actually Does** Chubb isn't selling car insurance to teenagers or processing homeowner claims in Florida (God help those insurers). They underwrite bespoke risks for multinational corporations and ultra-high-net-worth individuals: the kind of clients who need someone to insure their superyacht, their art collection, or their Brazilian subsidiary's data security risk, and are willing to pay top dollar for dependable insurance. This creates a virtuous cycle. Chubb has the balance sheet ($168 billion in cash and investments), reputation, and global footprint to attract the biggest clients. Those clients tend to be the *best* risks: deep pockets that aren't filing fraudulent claims or letting their cousin Vinny drive the Lambo. This elite risk pool yields higher underwriting margins, leading to an ever more unassailable balance sheet. **The Numbers That Matter** **Valuation:** * P/E: \~12x * P/B: \~1.5x * ROE: 15-16% **Operating metrics:** * Q3 combined ratio: 81.8% (more on this momentarily) * 9-month underwriting income: up 55% * Net premiums written: up 7.5% **The combined ratio** is the key metric here. It's (losses + expenses) / premiums. Under 100% means you're profitable before you even invest the float. Buffett measures insurance success by ""cost of float."" Anything under 100% means negative cost, i.e., you're getting paid to borrow money. Chubb consistently runs sub-90% and hit 81.8% last quarter (granted, catastrophes have been mild this year). Most insurers would kill for 95%. Side note: industry ""disruptor"" Lemonade is running >180%. **Why This Works** **The float advantage:** Like Berkshire, Chubb collects premiums today and pays claims later (sometimes much later for long-tailed risks). That cash gets invested—roughly 85% fixed income, 15% equities—which is more conservative than Buffett's approach but still generates substantial investment income. Q3 pre-tax net investment income was $1.65 billion, up 9.3%, and if rates stay elevated, this tailwind continues. **The inequality trade:** Chubb's sweet spot is ultra-high-net-worth individuals and multinational corporations. Global wealth concentration is increasing, not decreasing. The number of people who need seven-figure insurance policies is growing faster than the overall economy. This isn't a bet on economic growth; it's a bet on the continued bifurcation of wealth—a trend that seems unlikely to reverse regardless of which political party you think is destroying civilization. **Capital intensity as moat:** Yes, this business requires enormous capital to satisfy regulatory requirements and provide enough reserve to cover long-tailed risks. That's precisely why startups aren't disrupting it (and again, check out Lemonade’s fundamentals if you want to see what happens when a newcomer takes a shot at this space). Good luck raising $10s of billions to compete for this book. **Management That Gets It** CEO Evan Greenberg has been in insurance for 50 years, CEO for over 20. The executive team has been together for decades. Listening to earnings calls, you hear a CEO that is obsessed with underwriting, rides his team hard, and doesn’t care about market perceptions. Talk is cheap, but it’s encouraging to hear all the right things from a guy who keeps executing at such a high level. More importantly: management clearly believes the stock is undervalued and is aggressively buying back shares. They stepped up buybacks in Q3 explicitly because the stock trades ""well below intrinsic value,"" and Greenberg laughs at the idea of chasing bad business in a “soft” market. **The Bear Case (Such As It Is)** **Catastrophes:** Hurricanes, earthquakes, and other acts of God (or climate change, depending on your priors) are inherently unpredictable. Q3 cat losses were $285 million vs. $765 million last year, but nine-month cat losses were $2.56 billion vs. $1.78 billion—the lumpy nature of insurance volatility in miniature. Look back over two decades and you'll find a few quarters post-Katrina or similar disasters where combined ratios broke 100%. We can't model this better than Chubb's actuaries (who are paid handsomely to do exactly that), but their track record suggests they price it correctly better than their competitors, and they have the balance sheet to weather what smaller insurers cannot. The other silver lining: cat risk is genuinely uncorrelated with your equity portfolio imploding, which is more than you can say for most ""diversifiers."" **Capital intensity:** All that capital could theoretically be deployed at higher returns elsewhere. But it's also the moat, and it generated $1.65 billion in investment income last quarter. Fixed income has been a loser for years, but historically we see 5-10 year periods where bonds outperform equities. If that happens, Chubb's conservative allocation becomes an unexpected windfall. **Multiple expansion risk:** At 1.5x book, this isn't quite Benjamin Graham territory. You're paying a modest premium for quality. But we also aren’t talking a Costco-type premium – if Chubb gets caught up in a broader correction and I see it at 1.2x book, that is just an even better buying opportunity in my book. **The Pitch** Chubb is positioned to deliver mid-teens ROE indefinitely, driven by superior underwriting, an excellent risk pool, and conservative but compounding investment income on a huge base. Pay 1.5x book, and even if the multiple never expands, your returns should track book value growth (as represented by ROE), call it 10%-15% annually. If rates stay elevated, you get a bonus from higher than bargained for investment income. If the market decides safety trades shouldn't only come from consumer brands trading at nosebleed multiples, you get multiple expansion. The downside is that the business does exactly what management says it will do: compound book value at mid-teens rates, and you merely earn an excellent return. The upside is the market wakes up and decides a boring insurer generating 82% combined ratios deserves more than 12x earnings. I love being long this one.",40,21,2025-10-29 02:08:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oiskfi/chubb_cb_at_12x_quality_the_market_forgot_to/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.043803,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['bear', 'calls', 'earnings', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss', 'eps']",0.84,Communication Services
T,1opzsxl,wallstreetbets,Draftkings $DKNG YOLO and why,"DraftKings has been beaten down over the past few months, even though we’re in the middle of football season. The period that traditionally drives roughly 50% of their annual revenue. Polymarket, Robinhood, and Kalshi are names that seem to come up daily if you’re a DraftKings shareholder. But DraftKings offers a far superior user interface compared to any gambling or prediction market platform. It’s not even close. You can parlay and live bet on a wide variety of events as you watch the games. And I think people seriously underestimate how much Americans love betting on sports. DraftKings is currently trading at a price to sales ratio of around 2, which is incredibly cheap. The company grew revenue by nearly 40% year over year and is now the most profitable it has ever been. Today, they announced a multi-year deal with ESPN, giving them trust and visibility on the world’s #1 sports platform. I believe DraftKings could perform similarly to how Robinhood did when it ran from $20 to $100. It’s also likely that DraftKings will announce a share buyback after earnings today. This is the time to get excited about the stock. Prediction markets are federally regulated under the CFTC, meaning states don’t collect any of the revenue. That makes them unattractive for states to broadly encourage or legalize. In contrast, states prefer to license and regulate gambling directly since it creates jobs, tax revenue, and oversight. From a consumer protection standpoint, politicians can also justify high taxes on DKNG as “responsible gaming” revenue. Ultimately, DraftKings’ brand awareness and ease of use will continue to attract more users and turn them into long-term customers. Prediction markets, by comparison, are a far inferior product. Long DraftKings 21,685 shares at $28.49.

T,1ojb8hm,investing,"$RDW – Q2 was ugly, but Q3 might flip the story","Redwire ($RDW) is an aerospace and defense company that works with NASA, the European Space Agency and several US government programs. Earlier this year they also bought Edge Autonomy, which makes drones and ISR systems already used by the DoD, NATO allies and in nearly 80 countries. So Redwire isn’t just satellites and space hardware anymore, they now also have exposure to defense drones and optics, which makes the story a lot bigger. Q2 was rough. They had a big radio-frequency program, basically comms hardware for satellites and defense, where costs went over budget so management had to take the hit all at once. Some government contracts got pushed out and Edge brought integration costs before showing any revenue. Everything bad landed in the same quarter. The key detail though is backlog: it actually grew to about $329M. That’s not what happens when business is collapsing, that’s demand waiting to be recognized. Q3 looks very different. It’s the first full quarter with Edge included, the delayed revenue from Q2 can finally show up, and analysts are expecting around $132M compared to just $62M last quarter. You don’t leave a number like that in consensus unless management already has line of sight. If they deliver, the story flips quickly from execution mess to growth plus scale. Bain Capital Credit also sold 11M shares in September, which scared some people. But they were in through preferreds at $3.05, so selling at $7–8 was already a clean double. After the Edge deal AEI tightened control, so Bain had less influence. For a credit investor, taking the win and leaving made sense. It doesn’t mean Q3 is bad, it just means Bain had a different horizon. Now about the shares. At the end of 2024 they had around 67M. After Edge, equity raises and conversions, it’s now about 165M. So yes, dilution more than doubled the share count. That’s why comparing $7 today with $20 a few months ago is kinda misleading. The real point is that even with more shares, market cap dropped from about $2.5–2.8B at the summer peak to roughly $1.2–1.3B today. The company is bigger now, with Edge, a higher backlog and a broader customer base, but the market is valuing it at less than half what it was just months ago. That disconnect is exactly why it looks cheap here. Edge itself cost about $925M, a mix of cash and stock at about $15/share. In return, Redwire got scale, diversification and a foothold in fast-growing defense markets. Management guided combined 2025 revenue of $470–530M. If Q3 starts to reflect that, the numbers will look very different. Right now the stock trades around 3–4× forward sales with EV near $1.6B against that guidance. If they execute, that multiple is not demanding at all. Shorts add fuel. About 13% of the float is short, with 2–3 days to cover. In a small cap like this, if Q3 is solid, shorts may have to cover fast, which could add real pressure on the upside. Bottom line, Q2 was the reset. RF overruns, delayed revenue, Edge costs and even Bain’s exit all hit in one quarter while backlog still grew. 2025 brought dilution, but also Edge and a much bigger company overall. At $7–8, RDW trades at less than half the valuation it had months ago despite stronger fundamentals. The first real catalyst is Q3, and if backlog starts converting and Edge shows up in the numbers, the upside could be much bigger than what the market is pricing right now.

UNH,1ohnku8,wallstreetbets,Long Invisalign $ALGN,People’s teeth are always moving. Invisible braces are the present and the future. I have Invisalign $ALGN and it’s an awesome product. They also scan your mouth and use ai to predict the future movement of your teeth when they give you the trays. My teeth are almost perfect after using the product and it’s one of the best real world use cases of Ai I’ve seen. I also think rate cuts = people will be more likely to get braces because it’s an expensive thing The CEO also purchased 1m in shares in August around this price. I think it will have a similar move like UNH did. It’s only trading at a 12 forward PE. Hopefully ALGN can show more profitability or more revenue growth this quarter and bounce off this multi year bottom.,11,15,2025-10-27 19:13:42,https://i.redd.it/7yp5659pepxf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:39:21.710227,0.45,$UNH,1.0,['ALGN'],"['revenue', 'profit']",0.8114285714285714,Healthcare
T,1oqlvte,ValueInvesting,"When the Market Turns, So Does Everyone’s Patience","It’s always easy to talk about holding long term when everything’s green. You see people on X posting about how they’re never selling, how they’re in it for the next five years, how dips are “opportunities.” Then the market turns a little and suddenly everyone’s refreshing charts like it’s the world cup final. The same person who said “I don’t care about short term moves” is now calculating their entry and exit like a day trader with three monitors and no sleep. It’s kind of funny when you think about it. We all love the idea of being patient investors but patience disappears the moment candles start bleeding. I have seen some buying stocks onchain without even paying gas on some uex including bitget users and shouting “I’m not touching this bag for years” but I’m definitely sure if a red daily candle appears they will likely whisper to themselves, “maybe I should just take profit now and buy back lower.” Because i believe that’s how many people are. And i believe that’s the thing with markets, it messes with almost everyone's confidence more than balance. When it’s up you feel like a genius. When it’s down you start checking news headlines for reasons to panic. And deep down you know this cycle happens every single time, but you still fall for it because you’re human. But the fact is being a real long term investor isn’t about how long you say you’ll hold, it’s about how calm you stay when your screen looks like a crime scene. It’s easy to sound smart when the market’s smiling but the real test is when everything looks broken and you still somehow manage to convince yourself that maybe, just maybe, this is just another chapter, not the end.",32,24,2025-11-07 05:17:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oqlvte/when_the_market_turns_so_does_everyones_patience/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.832453,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['dip', 'profit']",0.8114285714285714,Communication Services

My fair value calculation** **if** Precovid, the sales and earnings were meh, **and** post covid the growth were 3-5% a year helped by increased hygiene awareness, inflation, and price increases **BUT** the company is having growth issues **then** what sort of growth guidance should i use ? i would model for a realistic long term growth of 3%, and this is generous because pre-covid sales are stagnant, eps was only growing at 1.2% a year. This is a good balance between post-covid realitities but also not so optimistic to use analyst growth numbers found above. I will use Dec 2025 estimate of EPS guidance of 3.6. i will assume Colgate will grow earnings at 3% a year forever, helped by a growing middle class, and in developing countries, people will brush their teeth more (to quote the Barron's article: “In urban India, 80% of people don’t brush twice a day, and in rural areas, only half brush daily, she said.""), the 3% EPS growth will also covers buybacks. Fair value calculation: (3.6 x (1+3%) ) / (discount rate - long term growth rate) discounte rate is 9% for me, the weighted cost of capital is closer 7.0% = (3.6 \* (1.03) / ( 9% -3%) = $61.8 the Fair value price is $61.8 The current Share price = $78 if i were to use a 5% growth for 10 years duration, the implied value is $73. I suspect that is what investors are expecting, ie >5% growth. **7. Conclusion:** I would want to buy CL at a deeper discount, as the street is pricing the business at growth rates that i think is not sustainable. (The ceo has only been running this company since 2019, but has been in the company for the last 38 years. I don't expect him to make too much changes to the growth algorithmn of Colgate. ) On the other hand, if i were to pursue this company, i would do a Gordon Dividend Model, ie buy based on dividend and don't look for share price appreciation. This is a stable boring 200 year old company that people have bought for dividends.

T,1opzgnr,stocks,DraftKings $DKNG is one of the most misunderstood stocks in the market. Here’s why I think it’s worth $100+,"DraftKings has been beaten down over the past few months, even though we’re in the middle of football season. The period that traditionally drives roughly 50% of their annual revenue. Polymarket, Robinhood, and Kalshi are names that seem to come up daily if you’re a DraftKings shareholder. But DraftKings offers a far superior user interface compared to any gambling or prediction market platform. It’s not even close. You can parlay and live bet on a wide variety of events as you watch the games. And I think people seriously underestimate how much Americans love betting on sports. DraftKings is currently trading at a price to sales ratio of around 2, which is incredibly cheap. The company grew revenue by nearly 40% year over year and is now the most profitable it has ever been. Today, they announced a multi-year deal with ESPN, giving them trust and visibility on the world’s #1 sports platform. I believe DraftKings could perform similarly to how Robinhood did when it ran from $20 to $100. It’s also likely that DraftKings will announce a share buyback after earnings today. This is the time to get excited about the stock. Prediction markets are federally regulated under the CFTC, meaning states don’t collect any of the revenue. That makes them unattractive for states to broadly encourage or legalize. In contrast, states prefer to license and regulate gambling directly since it creates jobs, tax revenue, and oversight. From a consumer protection standpoint, politicians can also justify high taxes on DKNG as “responsible gaming” revenue. Ultimately, DraftKings’ brand awareness and ease of use will continue to attract more users and turn them into long-term customers. Prediction markets, by comparison, are a far inferior product.

T,1oebz7g,ValueInvesting,Quantum-Si ($QSI) Due Diligence,"I thought I’d try writing a DD in order to share my thesis on QSI. If anyone has feedback or can catch things that I’ve missed, definitely please share. I would especially welcome opposing views. I believe that Quantum-Si (ticker QSI) is a promising biotechnology company worth looking into that specializes in producing platforms for single-molecule protein sequencing. To be very clear, this is NOT a quantum computing company as some people have said. It’s a hardware and consumables model through their Platinum Pro sequencing platform. Their pitch is that they offer a simpler and faster all inclusive system that can outperform the traditional methods of mass spectrometry or antibody-based analysis. The older methods are cheaper but way more complicated and time consuming. I personally have a gripe with mass spec specifically because of the queue system since everyone in the lab has to wait their turn and the process is slow even though each instrument costs like $20k. For the field as a whole, Protein sequencing is still a developing field compared to DNA or RNA sequencing. It’s a new frontier in biological research and this space is projected to be a seventy-billion dollar market. The idea is that if Quantum-Si can make proteomics more accessible, it could help with breakthroughs in drug discovery, diagnostics, and biomarker research. Their customer base is mainly biotech and pharma, but they’ve also been targeting academic labs. My home institution of Northwestern has used their systems, and the general feedback from the labs has been pretty positive. I do want to note that I have no idea if those were free trial/loaner units given to us, or if our miserly funding department actually paid for them. That said, there are obvious (and high) risks here. Execution risk is the biggest one, along with dilution and general biotech market volatility. I’ve been burned before by $HUMA, a company with a great product but questionable management, so I know good tech doesn’t always translate into good performance. In Quantum-Si’s case, the product works and the technology is real, but the pricing, while good for business, could limit adoption. Each unit runs around $100,000 and each sequencing kit costs about $500–600, so smaller labs need decent funding to afford it. Pharma companies won’t have that issue, but I’m not totally convinced that adoption across academia will be as fast or as wide as the company hopes. If instrument sales are slow and consumables don’t scale, we could see a long wait or some painful dilution. Financially, the company is better positioned than most micro-cap biotechs I’ve seen so far. They have around $260 million in cash and marketable securities after their July 2025 raise, and they burn about $90 million a year. That gives them a cash runway into mid-2027 or possibly mid-2028 depending on spending. They have zero debt, so they’re not under pressure to raise again anytime soon. There was a $50 million raise from a single institutional investor, which was really interesting. Random reddit posts say it's NVIDIA, but I’m very skeptical on that end. What we do know is that for one entity to put up that much money, they must have seen something in the data or product performance that impressed them. Even if it’s not a strategic partner, I think it still shows real confidence in the company’s direction. The current CEO Jeff Hawkins used to be at Illumina and has direct experience scaling sequencing platforms from concept to commercialization. I’m personally pretty happy that he has an MBA instead of a Phd. The rest of the management team also has backgrounds from companies like Thermo Fisher, 10x Genomics, and Oxford. Their founder and board member Dr. Rothberg is a biotech legend, but I’m not too sure how much stake he still holds in this company. For catalysts, the next few months will be worth watching. Earnings are scheduled for November 5, which should give us a clearer picture of revenue, burn rate, and how Platinum Pro placements are going. I think anyone that is skeptical of the company should wait until then before making an investment. Then on November 19, the company is holding its Investor and Analyst Day in New York City, where they’re expected to discuss long-term growth plans and give updates on the upcoming Proteus platform. The day after that, they’ll present at the Canaccord Genuity MedTech Forum, which might attract some institutional attention. The real thing that I’m looking forward to is the Proteus launch in the second half of 2026. That’s when we’ll really know if this is a commercial story or not. As for the upside, I see this as a 3–5 year play. If Quantum-Si executes, gets Proteus out successfully, and starts showing real traction with pharma clients, I think the stock could easily reach the $5–10 range, maybe $15 in a best-case or acquisition scenario. Thermo Fisher or Illumina could see value in picking them up if the tech proves scalable. On the flip side, if adoption stays weak and another raise happens in 2026, it could drift back below $1. I see it as a classic asymmetric setup, but with a long enough runway and credible leadership to make the wait worth it. My personal position is 5,000 shares at an average cost of $1.70. My short-term target is around $5, mostly based on upcoming catalysts and the general re-rating that usually happens when sentiment turns.

T,1oc3ycm,ValueInvesting,Value Trap - Google,"Google has often been called a value stock, but I see it as a classic value trap, especially now, for the people touting it as one. This subreddit is fixated on the company's historical dominance and massive cash flow, yet continues to fails to fully price in the risks threatening its OG business model. Google's profits: 1. Are fundamentally tied to the cost per click advertising model within search. This generates most of their money, and relies on a user being directed to a page where they are exposed to multiple ads. This is now under direct attack. Just because it is still growing, doesn’t mean that it’s not going to fail. It can take a long time to stop a massive, powerful train. I believe there is momentum that is having ad revenues grow, while also being cut into, and that will continue, until the train is off the rails for this portion of profits. 2. The shift toward AI is the main threat. When we use AI, even Gemini, we are seeking a single response, not a scavenger hunt across ten different websites, regardless of the sources are available. Most people are stupid and are done after the first response. If Google is forced to embed these simple AI summaries into its main search to maintain relevance, two things happen: Increased cost for AI results instead of the OG results. This means less profit for them. AND revenue loss. Google users need to click on ads decreases because their question has already been answered. This is headed towards becoming obsolete for Google (and anyone’s) most profitable ad format in history. Other issues: Googles cloud is under pricing its services and investing billions in infrastructure just to try and play catch up. They’re going to get their lunch eaten by Azure and AWS. Waymo and other parts of this company are high risk start-up type bets and we are forced to invest in them when buying Google. Google is notorious for creating things and throwing in the towel and spending their money poorly (the opposite of Amazon - imagine if Amazon had Google cash flow, what they’d do with it. Oh wait, they won’t, because they actually know how to reinvest properly). Also, regulatory hurdles. Google has a target on its back still. People just don’t like them.

T,1o2fjw4,ValueInvesting,Policy-driven mispricing? NAT might be an overlooked hard-asset play before U.S.–China ship fees kick in ⚓️📈,"Looking at Nordic American Tankers (NAT), I think there’s an interesting asymmetry forming in a part of the shipping market that most people ignore. Here’s the setup: The U.S. will start enforcing a new fee regime on ships linked to China (by build, ownership, or operation) starting October 14th. The goal is to counter China’s shipbuilding dominance and redirect demand to non-Chinese fleets. (CBP Policy Release) Most analysts (BIMCO included) think it won’t move the overall market — fair enough. But Suezmax crude tankers, which mainly serve the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic routes, don’t have the flexibility to simply “redeploy.” If even a small portion of Chinese-built or Chinese-operated Suezmaxes avoid U.S. calls, supply tightens locally — and compliant operators capture the spread. NAT is one of the cleanest public exposures to that thesis: • 20 Suezmax ships, only one built in China (rest Korea/Japan) • Low-cost operator, very transparent financials • Trades around $3.30/share, roughly 1.3× book • Net debt ≈ $350M vs. equity ≈ $485M → leverage under 1× • Dividend history of 100+ consecutive payouts (currently $0.10/share) • Insider alignment — CEO and his son have been buying more shares If rates on compliant Suezmaxes normalize from $25K/day to even $40K–$60K/day, NAT’s free cash flow could more than double. Historically, that kind of environment pushes book multiples closer to 1.5×–1.6×, implying fair value in the $7–$8 range. This isn’t a fast-growth story. It’s a hard-asset business that could benefit from policy friction — similar to how tariffs or regulations can distort supply-demand balance for a few years at a time. And you’re paid a double-digit yield while waiting for the market to reprice it. Risks: • U.S. could delay or water down the fees (though guidance and payment rails are already in place). • Oil demand or VLCC oversupply could blunt Suezmax margins. • Shipping cycles can turn quickly. The upside: You’ve got a policy catalyst, a scarce fleet class, insider alignment, and real assets backing the stock. If nothing happens, you collect yield. If the policy sticks, the rerate could be 2–3× over the next couple of years. Not investment advice — just curious if anyone else sees this as a case of policy-driven mispricing in a tangible-asset business.",8,2,2025-10-09 19:36:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o2fjw4/policydriven_mispricing_nat_might_be_an/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.916279,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'dividend']",0.7114285714285714,Communication Services

Convince me to hold long term and believe in crypto, or convince me this has no utility and I sell after a little profit.","Sorry if there is a post similar to this elsewhere, I’m not finding it. Explain this to me like I’m a 5 year old… I will give a little background on my understanding of Bitcoin/crypto. I have had many in person conversations with people who love Bitcoin and claim it is the future. For the last 11 years since being introduced to it, I just don’t get it as nobody has been able to explain it to me. It just comes one big frustrating circle jerk. I have heard one decent use for Bitcoin, and that is for wiring money outside of the country at a lower transaction fee compared to wiring money. Great! I can wrap my mind around that, as that is a $35B US market. I understand that traditional currency will get devalued over time due to printing more money. Bitcoin only gets divided as time goes on and no more will be released after a certain date. This is a great theory. So I am now trying to possibly avoid losing 3% due to inflation and the devaluing dollar. Sure no more Bitcoin will be created, but new crypto ( or shit coin ) gets created every day. I know, I know, I know all shit coins go down to zero which just leaves Bitcoin. But still, to think Bitcoin can’t be replaced just like AOL, Yahoo, Friendster etc.. would be pretty short sited. This is not a point I am trying to debate or learn about. ??????????????? Question… how is Bitcoin suppose to be better than traditional currency? After all, the value of Bitcoin here in the US is based on the USD. I have heard many argument made by crypto lovers that the USD is shit. If the USD is shit, then what’s the point of Bitcoin if it is directly correlated to the USD. Maybe the better question is, what will it take to drive actually utilization of Bitcoin on a more accepted basis? I’ve never walked into a store and saw a price tag on an item that said the cost of this item is .00025 bitcoins. I have not heard of any jobs paying their employees at .00016 bitcoins per hour Even if there was, that cost and profit margin would have been based on USD calculations. Again, I’m not saying Bitcoin or crypto has no utility. I just don’t know why 90% of the population or more actually needs crypto vs a credit card or even cash. This is not a topic on “ Cash is going away “. That will be a separate thread once I am convinced of the utility and stability of Bitcoin. I also can’t stop thinking about AOL, Yahoo, Friendster, MySpace, Skype etc… but these example show that I am thinking crypto in general has a future. Also not to be debated here. This can be a separate thread after I am convinced of Bitcoins utility and stabilty.",0,37,2025-10-13 05:56:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5bpht/bitcoin_i_am_a_new_investor_in_the_space_convince/,2025-11-07 16:43:31.496758,0.45,$T,0.8,[],['profit'],0.7057142857142856,Communication Services
T,1opjazm,ValueInvesting,"Price is the Primary Factor of Value, not Quality","I'm sure a lot of people will have their eyes glaze over almost instantly just from the title alone, but some people might agree. I personally think when it comes to value investing, price is the primary factor, not quality. Quality is important, but price supersedes quality in my opinion. **“I am 85% Graham and 15% Fisher”** Warren Buffett What’s the difference between the two, really? Fisher’s scuttlebutt approach has more of an emphasis on qualitative factors, such as competitive advantage, and wonderful businesses with long term compounding potential. Graham has more of an emphasis on quantitative factors, such as using valuation models and focusing more on businesses based on financial statement numbers. When I read through forums like this sub, the vast majority of individual retail value investors today seem to be the inverse of Buffett’s quote. 85% Fisher and 15% Graham. Is this a good approach? I suppose it depends on many factors, mostly on one’s own needs and expectations. As Berkshire has grown their capital base larger and larger over the years, their returns have been drawn closer and closer to the average returns of the market. For the last couple of decades, they’ve just about matched the market’s returns. What this means is that if someone is only focusing on large/mega cap businesses with a Fisher approach, if they have the same level of ability as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, long term, they should probably expect to beat the average market return by a few percentage points. This is because the larger and more followed a business is, the less likely it is to be significantly undervalued. If someone concentrated into one booming industry, they may outperform in the short term, but investing based on market dynamics/predictions and not business fundamentals is speculation. Some people may use examples of a large/mega cap stock going up over 100%+ in a year, showing you can get large returns with large stocks, but if someone could consistently pick these out on a regular bases at that scale, they’d be one of the richest people on the planet within 1 decade starting with $100,000. It is not a realistic example of return potential. Now that being said, even 2% outperformance is nothing to scoff at. A 2% higher return over 35 year would double your initial investment. **What if you’re 85% Graham and 15% Fisher Instead?** This type of mental model is vastly different because you compare businesses based on fundamental valuations, while still acknowledging that long term compounders with a competitive advantage is the ideal business type to hold, but it also doesn’t mean wonderful businesses are the best investment, because these types of business are rarely undervalued to any level of significance’. Instead of being locked onto only focusing on wonderful businesses, this mental model allows you to be far more adaptive with the ability to pivot to different types of undervaluations or even different asset classes all together. Just for the sake of example; You have two options. 1. A wonderful business, a great brand, competitive advantage, low debt, and compounding earnings. You predict this business will return around a 15% CAGR/year. 2. Junk bonds, normally not touched by most investors, begin having their coupon rate’s increased. First they’re at 5%. Then they go to 10%. Then they go to 20%. Then they go to 40%. Then they go to 80%. Then they go to 160%. Overall the trash bond market has a delinquency rate of say, 20%. So the question is, comparing the two, if you wanted to buy a basket of the junk bonds, at what coupon rate would you buy the junk bonds over the wonderful business? **“Businesses have coupons that are going to develop in the future too, the only problem is they aren’t printed on the instrument - and it’s up to the investor to try to estimate what those coupons are going to be over time”** Warren Buffett This exact same thing applies to lousy-mediocre businesses. At what undervaluation is the lousy business a better investment than the wonderful business? 30%? 60%? 90%? There is a number, so what is it? This is a prime example of why valuation models and actually valuing business is extremely important for value investing, and why price is the biggest factor of a good value investment, not the quality of the business.

T,1o8dl46,ValueInvesting,Looking for the bear case on GENDA (TSE: 9166),"I have been studying GENDA (TSE: 9166) and am trying to find clear reasons why it might not be a good investment at the current valuation. Usually, with roll-up companies, there are obvious concerns around debt, dilution, or weak integration, but GENDA seems more disciplined than most. **Business context** GENDA operates mainly in Japan’s entertainment sector, focusing on arcades, karaoke, and related businesses. The company has completed roughly 30–40 acquisitions since its 2019 inception. Its environment is unusually favorable: * Many small and medium-sized Japanese businesses lack a successor due to the aging population. * The domestic M&A market is far less competitive than in the US, allowing GENDA to buy quality businesses at low valuations. * Much of their debt is fixed at around 1.5%, which has kept financing costs very low. * The entertainment industry is highly fragmented, creating consistent roll-up opportunities. Because of these factors, GENDA has built a strong reputation as a reliable and aggressive buyer which many businesses would be happy to sell to (they're the ""buyer of choice"", as they put it themselves). Average acquisition multiples have ranged from 2.5x to 8x EV/EBITDA, typically around 4.5x. As a result, revenue has grown roughly 40% year over year. One way to look at potential upside is that GENDA is acquiring companies at 3–6x EV/EBITDA while its own stock trades around 12x. That spread, combined with consistent integration, supports compounding value creation over time. **North America expansion** Recently, GENDA has expanded aggressively in North America, acquiring two large arcade operators. One of them was National Entertainment Network (NEN), purchased at around 3.5x EV/EBITDA. After introducing Japanese IP-focused machines, sales on average doubled across upgraded locations. This shows that they are not just acquiring earnings but also improving the operations of acquired businesses. Considering that this is quite a slow and arguably boring sector, I think such numbers are really impressive. It also shows the interest that Western (or at least North-American) people seem to have in Japanese-inspired prizes. **Management and capital allocation** The management team includes veterans from Aeon Fantasy, SEGA Sammy, and Bandai Namco, and one co-founder previously worked at Goldman Sachs Japan. Their investor communication is unusually transparent for a Japanese company. They often explain the expected return on each acquisition, including detailed ROIC assumptions,. Historically, GENDA financed acquisitions mostly with debt and sometimes equity. As of September 2025, they announced a shift toward funding future M&A and organic growth entirely through operating cash flow. This likely reflects their leverage level of about 2.5x net debt/EBITDA, which is near their internal limit of 3x. They indicated that debt could again be used once EBITDA increases. **Valuation** GENDA currently trades at around 18x forward P/E and 14x next year’s P/E, and roughly 9–12x EV/EBITDA. For a company growing earnings by about 40% year over year, this seems low. Of course, much of that growth comes from acquisitions, but organic improvements have also been very meaningful, as the NEN example shows. Still, it is an unconventional business. Arcades, karaoke, and character IP are not exactly predictable markets. That said, these are established industries in Japan — and increasingly in the US — rather than short-lived trends or hypes, so I don’t see a high risk of the whole concept collapsing. My question is: what are the key risks that make this valuation justified? Where could this roll-up strategy break down? I always try to find reasons not to buy a stock and usually succeed, but in this case the combination of disciplined execution and relatively low valuation makes it hard to see the expected value as anything other than positive.",1,3,2025-10-16 18:08:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o8dl46/looking_for_the_bear_case_on_genda_tse_9166/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.116996,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['bear', 'earnings', 'support', 'revenue', 'acquisition']",0.6285714285714286,Communication Services

Let me know your feedback and how I can improve! This week of Oct 27 - Oct 31 is one of many catalysts, including the FOMC meeting, big tech earnings, and other macro events unfolding. One, there will be the FOMC meeting on Wednesday (Thursday Midnight if you're Malaysian), with expectations of a 25bps rate cut largely expected and price in. In addition, the key thing that will be in focus is whether the Fed would formally announce the end of QT (quantitative tightening) as JP Morgan outlined as their expectations last Friday. If true, this will be taken as extremely dovish since halting QT raises bank-reserve growth, which in turn lowers collateral risk and mitigates left-tail liquidity events. Note that the end of QT does not mean the start of QE (quantitative easing). However, it still supports credit and equities as it supports risk events and provides a significant stability backstop for risk assets like equities. To the speculators (or gamblers), many major tech companies are due to report earnings this week, see $META, $MSFT, $GOOG, on Wednesday after-hours, and $AMZN and $AAPL on Thursday after-hours, in total (+ other companies) this week accounts for around 20% of the S&P500 by market cap reporting earnings. A stacked earnings week like this often increases idiosyncratic risk and opens up strategies that are short correlation as the amplitude of stock-specific moves rises relative to the broader index. See dispersion trading where you could profit from the spread between individual stock IV (implied volatility) and the relatively lower implied vol. of the broader index. Macro-wise, trade negotiations between US (Trump) and China (Xi) are also due on Thursday, where apparently both countries ""reached a consensus"" through their correspondents (Bessent + Vice Premier of China) on key trade issues like export controls, tariff suspensions, etc... after ""constructive"" talks in Malaysia. A formal announcement is expected on Thursday. Was supposed to post this pre-market but got caught up with some commitments. Let me know what you think of this in the comments, would love to see potential avenues of improving my write-ups and my research.

T,1oblpgz,ValueInvesting,PDD’s operating profit fell 28.5% year-on-year in H1 2025. Does this mean its high growth and profitability are no longer sustainable? Or could it all have been a fraud?,"Most of you probably know PDD already, so I’ll keep the intro short. PDD’s success is built on the group-buying model, letting users team up to buy the same product at a lower price. By aggregating massive demand, PDD could negotiate better deals and offer cheaper prices than anyone else. Rivals like JD and Alibaba tried to copy PDD’s model with Jingxi and Taote, but both failed to achieve similar scale. Once their subsidies ended, prices rose and users left. Until 2025, PDD seemed unstoppable: growing fast, staying highly profitable, and keeping its balance sheet lean. **In H1 2025, revenue growth slowed to 8.6%, and operating profit fell 28.5%. What went wrong?** From what I can tell, two things happened at once: 1. China’s 2025 Electronics and Home Appliance Subsidy Program, which PDD couldn’t fully take advantage of 2. Political pressure forcing PDD to change how it treats merchants Both factors hit margins hard. **1. China’s 2025 Electronics and Home Appliance Subsidy Program, which PDD couldn’t fully take advantage of** In January 2025, China rolled out a [massive new stimulus program](https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xxgk/zcfb/tz/202501/t20250108_1395564.html) aimed at boosting domestic consumption. The policy offered: * Up to 15% subsidies (capped at RMB 500 per item) for electronic products * Up to 20% subsidies (capped at RMB 2,000 per item) for home appliances. Sounds great, right? But PDD couldn’t actually benefit from these government subsidies. Instead, it had to fund similar discounts from its own pocket just to stay competitive against JD and Taobao. Why? Because most merchants on PDD are small to medium-sized sellers, and the subsidy rules made it extremely difficult for them to qualify. To participate, sellers had to: * Sell only products that met official energy or water efficiency certification standards (for home appliances) * Upload valid manufacturer serial numbers * [Undergo delivery verification](https://sww.sh.gov.cn/swdt/20250226/4ce64e7425c0476dbc43eca7c8f7a237.html), meaning the delivery driver had to take photos and record product IDs to prove the buyer received the item. These measures were introduced to prevent subsidy fraud, but they also created a huge administrative and compliance burden. Worse still, merchants had to [advance the subsidy from their own cash flow](https://stcn.com/article/detail/1393379.html) and wait months for government reimbursement, which created a significant burden for small sellers with limited liquidity. So naturally, most small merchants chose not to participate, and PDD had to pay the subsidies out of pocket to keep prices competitive. Meanwhile, JD had no such problem. JD sells directly from its own inventory and works with large brand flagship stores, the exact kind of merchants that do qualify for the subsidies. So JD ended up being one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government program, while PDD took the hit. **2. Political pressure forcing PDD to change how it treats merchants** The second major headwind likely came from government pressure. In 2024, hundreds of merchants [protested ](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3272437/chinese-suppliers-storm-temu-office-guangzhou-protest-over-harsh-policies)outside PDD’s office, accusing the platform of unfair treatment. They said customer-merchant disputes were handled opaquely and always favored buyers. Some claimed they were fined heavily or forced to refund customers without requiring the goods to be returned. Given how sensitive the Chinese government is to social unrest, PDD probably faced strong pressure to fix these issues quickly. Since then, the company has pivoted hard toward merchant support. It launched a series of initiatives to improve relations with sellers, including fee reductions, logistics assistance, and softer penalties. Most notably, in April 2025, PDD announced its [“100 Billion Support Program,” ](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2025-04-03/doc-inerwrzr1503992.shtml)committing RMB 100 billion (around USD 14 billion) over three years to help merchants lower costs and improve product quality, smart for the long run, but it is hitting short-term profits hard **So, what is the likely outcome of this crisis? Can PDD return to growth and profitability?** . . . \[Check out the [full post](https://compoundingcompetence.substack.com/p/pdds-operating-profit-fell-285-year?r=60rv48&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true) on my Substack if you’d like to dive deeper\]",3,0,2025-10-20 15:28:10,https://open.substack.com/pub/compoundingcompetence/p/pdds-operating-profit-fell-285-year?r=60rv48&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true,2025-11-07 16:44:16.100387,0.45,$T,0.6,[],"['rally', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.6228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1o7yjt3,ValueInvesting,Update on Conrad Shipyards (CNRD),"$28 per share 5.01 million shares out $140 million market cap $17.2 million TTM earnings 8.1X trailing PE $249 million in backlog as of June 2025, down slightly from $293 million in backlog in December 2024 I wrote up Conrad Shipyards in June, and the stock is up 75% since then. I’ve been adding to the position since June, it’s gotten quite large, but I’m still holding and I still think it’s a decent buy even at these levels. Link to the last write up: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/eqTISdmPZE Conrad Shipyards is one of 5-6 shipyards in the U.S. which focuses on small and medium sized vessels. Others include Bollinger Shipyards, Metal Shark, Swiftships, Nichols Brothers Boat Builders, and Senesco, but all of these are private. The story has played out nicely. Shipbuilding has high fixed costs, so there is huge operating leverage when revenue improves. The company has swung from a negative gross profit in H1 2024 of -$9.4 million to positive gross profit in H2 2025 of $25.6 million, and operating margins went from -6% to positive 6%. The backlog is down slightly from December 2024 but was still quite healthy as of the last quarterly report, with about 9 months of backlog baked in. As I wrote previously, the company was capital constrained due to multiple bad years for the shipbuilding industry. There is a concept called “bonding capacity” which is critical in shipbuilding, where a surety bond issuer issues a bond to ensure the customer gets the ship they paid for and all the subcontractors still get paid if the primary contractor (Conrad) goes out of business. In the most recent quarterly report, they mention that they have improved their financial condition and improved their bonding capacity. So they should be able to expand their shipbuilding capacity going forward. Cash on the balance sheet continues to grow and now sits at $46 million, with only $2 million of debt. Net working capital sits at $51 million, and book value sits around $91 million. The Trump admin announced in April a Section 301 investigation into China’s shipbuilding and “unfair maritime practices”, with a plan to create a “Maritime Action Plan” by November 5, 2025. So we’ll see if this plan actually comes out, and what it looks like, but it seems like a major catalyst is on the near term horizon. One of the big drags has the been the increase in steel prices in 2025 on the back of steel tariffs. Hot rolled coil prices jumped to the high $900/ton range, but have since moderated to the mid $800s. So it’s still a risk to watch out for but we haven’t seen continued rises in input costs. The company was initially awarded a contract for a Navy Yard, Repair, Berthing, and Messing barge back in March 2022, with options for up to 7 additional barges. Based on the sub commentary from r/Navy on the Conrad deal, the Navy was desperately in need of new barges (https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/s/hMwsvFvai1). In December 2024, the company got a $28 million contract for a 9th barge, and in June 2025, they got a contract for a 10th. The company has a history of making good dredging barges, and won several awards in the past year for these boats. They also continue to get contracts from municipalities such as New York for the new Governor’s Island ferry and Puerto Rico for multiple passenger ferries. But the most interesting new contract they got was from a startup called Blue Water Autonomy for a long range, autonomous ships. https://youtu.be/2DU79wXL4n0?si=n3-YjjT-vGRdaB4I Blue Water plans to build a whole fleet of autonomous ships for mine detection and surveillance, and Conrad was selected as the shipyard for Blue Water’s new ships. As one of the few domestic shipyards that makes small boats, Blue Water only has a few options for a domestic shipyard for these boats. Congress has already allocated $2 billion for medium sized unmanned surface vehicles, and Blue Water seems pretty ambitious in its goals. If Conrad delivers on this first boat to satisfaction, they could get a lot more follow on orders from Blue Water, which could bring in a lot of additional revenue. Right now it is still at a little over 8x trailing earnings, with about 30% of the market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. They have a history of doing buybacks from 2010-2017, but haven’t done in any in years because earnings haven’t been that good. Now that there is cash accumulating on the balance sheet again, I’d expect the buybacks to start up again which is another catalyst on the horizon.

AMZN,1oqyx1w,stocks,The market was vulnerable indeed. At a crossroads now.,"A little over week ago [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuturesTrading/comments/1ok88pn/is_the_market_vulnerable_here/) on Reddit that the market looked fragile due to the potent combination of breadth deterioration, MAGS-led complacency, TA vulnerabilities, and a climbing VVIX/VIX ratio, among other things. In line with recent times when we’ve seen this combination, the S&P futures have now pulled back over 3%. Downside setups were strong. So where do we stand now and how may this help evaluate what comes next? * The percentage of stocks above the 50-day MA has dropped a further 11% as compared to \~25% deterioration in the four-day period noted last week. So while we’ve seen some slowdown in that regard, the overall trajectory is clearly down and at levels on par with what we saw in April. * MAGS led index prices to new all-time highs this past week, but without the rally broadening out, the indices were super vulnerable. This week though, there is some welcome relief as the rising S&P equal weight : SPY ratio indicates broadening participation and improving market structure. * Last week I noted that the rising VVIX/VIX was our early sign that risk was ahead, though masked by headline index prices. As the VIX pushed over 21 today, we’ve not seen VVIX rise as fast and so this ratio has fallen substantially. * That decline indicates volatility demand is normalizing, suggesting the market is absorbing the shock rather than escalating it. * In fact, this ratio is now back to where it was in mid-October, when the S&P 500 futures (and index/SPY) tested the trend channel which developed coming out of April weakness. Prices are there again now, again testing the 50-day moving average and hovering just above the cloud model. Unfilled gaps created on the way up, a sign of weak structure, have now been filled (while a new one was created today). * While on the topic of technicals, the RUT double top was prescient, leading to a 6% pullback. * Elsewhere in the credit markets, short-term treasuries are outperforming high yield corporate bonds. That’s consistent with risk-off rotation but not yet systemic stress, since spreads are widening in an orderly fashion. * This leaves markets at a critical juncture and not nearly as clear as last week’s reading. Three technical things to watch will be: 1) Ability to recover the 50-day, 2) Reaction at cloud model, 3) Ability to recover primary trend. A bonus is how we see stochastics, pictured below, react at oversold levels. Recovering these levels would suggest the pullback was corrective instead of the start of something major. * At the portfolio level, I kept my anchor stocks (NVDA, AAPL, AMZN etc) but sold all speculative stocks and increased portfolio cash to about 53%. I'll wait until the above resolves until I increase positioning to 90% or more. * Seasonally, the market performs well November to year-end, though it's too early to count on that. https://preview.redd.it/95tfrknr2vzf1.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e53803e0c44f2350579d8f7d0549cd7eb9f908f",6,0,2025-11-07 16:25:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oqyx1w/the_market_was_vulnerable_indeed_at_a_crossroads/,2025-11-07 16:40:48.544908,0.45,$AMZN,0.9,[],['rally'],0.6057142857142856,Consumer Cyclical

T,1o37375,ValueInvesting,Thoughts on investing in Tokens,"I’ve been hearing a lot about tokens lately as a way to invest in private tech companies, so I thought I’d address the dangers of this approach here. Tokens are digital chips that pretend to follow a company’s share price on the blockchain. They are seen by many as a way to get access to private tech companies before they hit the market. It seems great on the surface due to the ability to have 24/7 trading, global reach and fractional ownership of great tech companies. But the reality is that I’ve heard that there are serious flaws to investing in tokens and I’d heavily advise against it. Anyone can create a token that claims to track a private company. That means there’s no real limit to how many tokens exist. The actual company (such as neuralink) tracked by the token might have 100 million real shares, while the token market could have billions of look-alikes. Those tokens don’t give you ownership, voting rights, or any legal claim on the company. It isn’t tied to real shares, so trading can look deep and active but vanish when size hits, making prices easy to game and rumors easy to exploit. This creates fake trading activity and the illusion of deep markets. Prices can move on hype or rumors, not on real business results. With no verified pricing or legal linkage, token prices can drift far from a company’s true value, fueling hype, misleading private-share pricing, and triggering cycles of pump-and-dump that damage the company’s perceived worth. There’s also a legal risk. Many of these stock-like tokens operate outside normal securities rules. Regulators have already taken action against some of them. The core issue: they blur the line between real ownership and imitation. Tl;DR: While tokens promise easy access, they often sacrifice trust and transparency. If not investing in the business, you're making a side bet on sentiment, with none of the rights of a true shareholder. Buyer Beware, IMHO.",1,2,2025-10-10 17:20:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o37375/thoughts_on_investing_in_tokens/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.905719,0.45,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6,Communication Services

T,1onk7x3,wallstreetbets,Why the bubble narrative is a generational GOOG buying opportunity,"Have gotten 20+ messages asking me if / when I plan to sell my GOOG LEAP position. So sharing my thoughts here: You basically can’t go 20 seconds without hearing someone mention the tech / AI bubble these days. It’s completely unavoidable and is shaping how people invest more than you may realize. But here’s why I think this narrative is actually creating a generational buying opportunity for a few companies. People are conflating the AI bubble and the massive growth of the Mag 6. But fail to acknowledge that, barring Nvidia, the Mag 6 growth is almost 100% due to non-LLM based bottom line growth. These monopolies are putting up Jokic numbers that justify these valuations.

After reporting a record breaking 100M revenue quarter, and beating EPS expectations by over 30%, GOOG stayed completely flat. Touted as part of the “frothy and way overbought” Mag 7, GOOG’s PE ratio of 27.91 is LOWER THAN SPY’s PE of 28.89. Let me repeat that for you: One of the three companies that can manufacture cutting edge AI chips at scale, the HIGHEST NET PROFIT COMPANY ON THE PLANET, that grew every part of its business double digits YoY, has a lower PE ratio than: -Walmart -Caterpillar -Costco -Nike -Hilton -Pepsi Talk about overvaluation. I’d argue the rest of SPY is more bubbly, as they are being bought via Index funds en masse due to MAG 7 gains, but aren’t being shorted like the MAG 7 are because that doesn’t fit the narrative. The way I see it, even if we are in a bubble, google does not depend on AI contracts dated 1-4 years out in the way that other players in the space do, as they consume the lions share of their own compute with their money printing businesses. And if we aren’t in a bubble, and those who control AI control the world, then google is probably the best positioned company out there. They have the strongest AI talent, have several already vetted AI business (Isomorphic labs, Waymo, Search, Shorts), own the entire AI stack: applications, models, chips, data centers (they have 10+ yoe building massive TPU data-centers on time). The absurd undervaluation compared to its peers (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) won’t last forever. Given google is the most profitable business in the world, either the rest of the Mag 6 need to show growth rates significantly higher than google’s absurd pace to justify the 30-40% premium, or GOOG will need to show signs of slowing down. But that’s not what we’re seeing today, and I’m tired of pretending that GOOGL is at all “overvalued” due to the AI bubble. it’s arguably the other way around.

T,1ohx878,wallstreetbets,The dip you have been waiting for. $UUUU DD,"Yes, another post about UUUU. I can hear the eye rolls already: another guy trying to pump his bags. But today’s selloff on the China trade deal headlines is precisely the kind of entry point where smart money starts to accumulate. Let me explain why with a short chemistry lesson, a look at how institutional capital is moving, and a dose of geopolitics. I’ve seen some DDs so I’ll try not to repeat too much, and I’ll make this more about inevitable reality than hype fluff. A Chemistry lesson : NdPr vs. Dy/Tb Everyone knows “rare earth magnets” mean NdPr (neodymium/praseodymium) magnets. They are found in smartphones, headphones, disk drives, and small motors. These magnets are strong and cheap, but their weakness is thermal: they start to lose strength at elevated temperatures. Enter dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb). These heavy rare earth elements dramatically increase coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) when you dope NdPr magnets with them. They extend operating temperatures well beyond 150–200°C. Without Dy and Tb, the magnets in EV motors, wind turbines, and defense applications fail. These two elements are the bottleneck. they are the real risk for modern national-security grade magnets. I would bet that the govt in their infinite wisdom knows this. The MP deal splashed across headlines over the summer did nothing to address this bottleneck. It was designed to keep near-term U.S. magnet production alive and avoid a politically embarrassing and economically shocking supply chain shutdown. But it does not solve the heavy rare earth problem and the national security vulnerabilities that result. You can source NdPr but you cannot sidestep Dy and Tb. And today, as has been mentioned many times, China controls 99.8% of Dy/Tb refining capacity. That is why Washington’s “deal” with Beijing is a band-aid. The underlying wound is still bleeding: without Dy/Tb refining capacity inside U.S. borders, there is no secure supply chain for the only magnets that matter. Do we think Xi and Don will kiss and make up and be friends forever now? Where the Money Is Moving Now, let’s assume that the government knows it has no choice but to secure domestic Dy/Tb refining. They have recently teamed up with Orion Resource Partners and Abu Dhabi to set up the fund that will secure a non-Chinese supply chain for heavies. If you search for their press releases and info about this 1.8B fund: they have made their investment criteria explicit: they will only back shovel-ready or producing companies. This filters out the noise and removes most juniors. There is exactly one company in the United States that can refine Dy and Tb today: Energy Fuels (UUUU). While all of you regards were freaking out about the China deal today, JP Morgan announced its first $75M tranche today as part of a $1.5T capital allocation into critical materials. Smart money is entering the chat. And when it comes to Dy/Tb, there is no option: the board has exactly one square. The Geopolitical Angle EVs, defense systems, wind turbines and clean energy tech: all of these require Dy/Tb-doped magnets. The U.S. cannot outsource that supply to China without strategic vulnerability. A stopgap deal might buy a few quarters. But the Pentagon and DOE are under no illusion: they need a domestic Dy/Tb supply chain, and they need it yesterday. That means capital, both public and private, is being funneled toward the one company capable of executing. Valuation: The Elephant in the room Now, there is one legitimate concern that bears addressing: valuation. Yes, UUUU has already run and yes, the stock is expensive. How much is geopolitical leverage worth? How much is national security worth? How much does the US spend per year on the military? 1T? You think there is some accountant who is considering the DCF who is going to talk the DOW and Don out of investing in our countries geopolitical, economic, and military safety? Conclusion Ignore the noise and doom right now around rare earths. I won’t even go into why I think a major part of the correction in rare earth stocks is linked to a momentum factor trade that buckets them in with a bunch of other assets that have appreciated over the last year. The actual choke point vulnerability that the US has right now is refining Dy and Tb. Without them, there is no EV motor, no wind turbine generator, and no mission critical defense tech. UUUU is the only U.S. player with the refining capability right now. The government knows this. Orion and ADQ know this. JP Morgan knows this. Industry knows this. Be greedy when others are fearful. Positions: 40 Jan 20 Calls. I’m poor but I’m not wrong. No dates, no hype, I just know there is no other option.",334,109,2025-10-28 01:52:37,https://i.redd.it/q48lzabvdrxf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:42:40.556046,0.4,$T,1.0,['UUUU'],"['bear', 'calls', 'dip', 'resistance']",1.0,Communication Services
T,1og1v78,wallstreetbets,$51K Gold/Crypto Futures Loss,"The image doesn't show the red loss number properly (Not sure how to), but I'm down $51k from a peak of $90,510 with -$37k realized for the full YTD. You can probably guess the moment I finally opened up to futures. I saw gold going up month after month, and figured it'd probably be a safe bet to just keep some futures sitting there longer term, so I sold all my crypto for gold futures on Coinbase the literal day before crypto crashed, bought the highest amount of gold and silver long contracts coinbase would let me, and got extremely lucky. So, I figured I'd use the excess money to go even higher risk for funsies and figured I'd try to ride crypto's rebound back up, and I figured I could just sell back out if it went back down to where I started. As it turns out, I do not know much about how stock prices work, so when crypto kept sliding instead of just steadily rebounding, I panicked, and kept flipping trying to day trade the money back, banking on the idea that gold would keep going up and pad my losses, and that I could just back out of crypto futures if I dropped back down to where I started, which I did, and it felt like a safe idea. Until it didn't. I straight up wasn't even looking at gold's charts and didn't see the double peak forming, and I didn't even set a stop loss (People kept hitting my crypto stop losses with some random wick 20% below the actual candle right before it shot up so I figured I'd just watch it all manually), so I rode it the whole way down on 80 contracts. At this point, I'm just stepping away from trading for a while to actually learn it properly and sticking to smaller moves when I get back in, but I'm still hoping to re-enter gold after the correction is decisively finished if I can and just swing trade some longs again and keep rolling them longer term with a rising stop loss this time since the long term outlook still seems pretty overwhelmingly positive, but I have no idea if that'll work out. Definitely going to be playing it a lot safer until I'm a little more consistent, and ease into larger positions from now on, but I am left still pretty genuinely interested in the whole world of investing; I'd really like to actually understand it better, and I do find it pretty fun to root on price movements with others live in some streams. So, I'm not out yet, but this really does hit hard. Lesson of the day: Do NOT ever touch leverage until you know how to properly stop loss.

T,1ohfc9l,stocks,"Tesla risks losing CEO Musk if $1 trillion pay package isn’t approved, board chair says","Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm, in a letter Monday, asked shareholders to vote for CEO Elon Musk’s nearly $1 trillion pay package ahead of the company’s annual meeting. Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus. “Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote. Denholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront. “The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said. Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it. Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand. Tesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5. Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines. The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk said to analysts. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.” The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%. “He’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the AI,” Denholm told CNBC. “So it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.” Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote. She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

T,1octyv8,stocks,Take Back Tesla campaign urges shareholders to reject Musk $1 trillion pay plan,"A day ahead of Tesla’s quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance. On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company. Tesla’s board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company’s annual meeting next month. On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package “outrageous,” in part because Musk’s “political activities have damaged Tesla’s brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.” The site says the plan doesn’t require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors. The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf. “Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,” the site says. “That’s our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.” Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People’s Action and Stop the Money Pipeline. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk’s previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested. Following those firms’ suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, “ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla’s proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.” The company added that shareholders who sold would “have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.” The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal. Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated. Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having \~25% voting control.” The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade. Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he “vociferously opposes this pay package” and says other public fiduciaries should do the same. “Most of the time we’ve held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it’s grown over time, and that’s why we haven’t chosen to dump it,” Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he’s preferred to “hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.” Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August. He said he views Tesla’s board he as “insufficiently independent,” and that it’s allowed Musk to be an “absentee CEO.” The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said. The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it’s still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025. Musk has “been an inconsistent CEO at best,” Lander said, “and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.” Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

T,1oawxqp,stocks,"Fundamentals Don’t Matter in Predicting Bubble Pop, Sentiment and Liquidity Do","I keep seeing people go on and on about how the AI bubble is going to burst soon because the fundamentals are so stupid and it echoes so many elements of past popped bubbles. I think the mistake her is that it assumes a rational investor who gives a fuck about if the underlying company behind the stock makes sense. I personally feel the average investor retail or investor is just a dummy who invests based on what they think other people believe other people believe and how much easy stock-buying money that have access to at any given time. Only two things I think matter now. One is Sentiment (and not even what an investor believes but what that investor believes other investors believe other investors believe. So even if a person thinks a company’s stock is stupid and overvalued, if they believe other people believe other people buy into the stock, they’ll do it too especially when FOMO and YOLO are high. Two is liquidity: how much money do people have lying around to throw at half-baked dice rolls without having to liquidate another stock first? As long as people or institutions have disposable income in this climate of extra-stupid divorced from reality people they will just keep dip buying and riding out lows. A lot of popular sentiment, number one, flows from liquidity, number two. One people start running out of money and their personal finances are a mess and they need help to pay their bills and can’t just buy new stocks without liquidating old stocks and worse their old stocks are too in the toilet to even liquidate, then the sentiment will go into the toilet as they can’t just FOMO and YOLO and dip buy and ride out price drops at will anymore. Then and only then will fundamentals and bad news and earnings skepticism and giving a fuck about if company’s business model or stock price makes any sense. Comparing to past cycles doesn’t mean anything because people weren’t as routinely delusional as now. In 2008 insane multiples of valuation based strictly on growth was still a novel concept that wasn’t fully normalized and bought into. It still had a lot of skepticism. Investors were easier to scare. Now it’s way too routine to ignore traditional metrics in favor of arbitrary vanity metrics and good growth fairy tale stories and buzz. I think as long as people can keep finding money to buy more stocks and a lot of people stay once in a lifetime levels of stupid talking about fundamentals won’t matter. I think if a bubble pop happens it’s more likely to happen off some weird black swan event than a rise in common sense and sound financial analysis. As long as everyone else is buying stocks and driving stock prices up and people have money lying around to follow suit, they will just keep rationalizing away all the bad fundamentals and ridiculous unrealistic promises in the world. The only reason the circular accounting in AI story is even gaining traction isn’t because any of this is new (youtubers like Nobody Special Finance and various Twitter uses were pointing it out for years and were called permanent cranks); it’s because people and institutions are getting broker and more economically precarious and scared and uncertain and now are willing to entertain the theory despite dismissing it the past few years when they were economically secure enough to not care.",117,58,2025-10-19 18:21:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oawxqp/fundamentals_dont_matter_in_predicting_bubble_pop/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.834344,0.4,$T,0.9,[],"['earnings', 'yolo', 'dip']",1.0,Communication Services

I predict the **International Operations** to have a significantly **strong performance in November Q3** and will continue for many quarters to come. Since July 1st Wegovy has been accessible to NZ patients and I on average initiate 3-4 patients a week on treatment. This is \~ $460 dollar a month treatment, which over the 3 month quarter will generate $16,560 revenue for 1st month dosing plus the sum of repeat months. This is a medication that for a significant cohort will be a long-term medication. This **compounding effect** will be substantial for NVO’s Revenue as more and more patients are commenced on Wegovy as a chronic medication with **reoccurring monthly revenue generation.** I will let you extrapolate these figures to forecast the potential impact. Eli-lilly’s Tirzepatide is currently not available in NZ, not funded for T2DM and not accessible for Obesity. I have read many investors perspective’s quoting Tirzepatides superior weight loss efficacy stats. However, I argue that they are missing the point. What is becoming clear is that Semaglutide is becoming arguably best in class GLP-1 due to it's **multiple-indications** and overall health benefit. There is increasing evidence for Semaglutides role in Obesity, Cardiovascular risk reduction (decreasing frequency of Strokes/Heart attacks), Metabolic Fatty Liver Disease (MASH), CKD, T2DM and Sleep Apnoea. When a clinician is deciding what glp-1 to start, we are tailoring the choice to the individual mix of comorbidities the patient has. Both, Tirzepatide and Semaglutide are going to become ubiquitous in health care, like BP medications and Statins. There is room for both these medications, which no doubt will offer slightly different characteristic profiles. Some patients once reaching target weight won’t want the most efficacious weight loss profile as their goal has shifted to maintenance. More and more focus will shift from pure play weight loss management to the clinical mentality of multi indication prescribing for Metabolic Health Benefits (Stroke/Cardiovascular risk/CKD/Glycaemic control/MASH/Sleep Apnoea). **MASH**: [https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916416](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=916416) [https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=171971](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=171971) **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction** [https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=169183](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=169183) [https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=167030](https://www.novonordisk.com/content/nncorp/global/en/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=167030) **Sleep Apnoea** [https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/6236](https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/6236) **Further Growth Drivers:** \- **MASH** is currently an unmet need and interventions reversing fatty liver and fibrosis are a key focus for pharmaceuticals.

Data is going to be published @ “Obesityweek 2025” conference Nov 4th. FDA decision is expected 4th quarter of 2025. If approved, this would be the first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for chronic weight management. Oral Semaglutide at 50mg dosing @ 68 weeks has observed 15% weight loss reduction (Oasis 1 phase 3), whereas Eli – Lilly’s Orforglipron average weight loss had \~11.2% (Attain-1 Phase 3) @ 72 weeks. With time; **efficacy** and **tolerability** data @ doses being used for Obesity indication will determine whether NVO or LLY will have the edge. As of yet, it is too early to determine. \- An area to watch will be NVO’s **Oral Amycretin** performance , a Phase 1 study demonstrated 13% body weight reduction @ 12 weeks. With NVO planning to initiate a phase 3 trial in Q1 2026. \- **Subcutaneous Amycretin** use in obesity. Phase 1b/2a Trial demonstrated Once weekly S/C injection 20mg + 60mg @ 36 weeks lost on average 22% and 24.3% respectively. (For **comparison**, as per Surmount 5 study; Tirzepatide 15mg once weekly s/c injection on average lost 20.2% @ 72 weeks vs Semaglutide 2.4mg once weekly s/c lost 13.7%. Step Up Trial using Semaglutide at higher doses of 7.2mg dose s/c weekly injections demonstrated 18.7% average weight loss @ 72 weeks regardless of tolerance.) **- Epidemiological and Societal impact**: Prevalence of T2DM and Obesity is increasing. Emerging/developing economies and societal pressures is leading to increasing demands for these therapeutics; bullish for both NVO & LLY’s future. **- Increasing strategic focus on direct to patient avenues**. E.g Novocare Pharmacy and strategic retail partnerships are being developed (Costco, CVS, Weigthwatchers). ?Trump rx platform ?? **- Ubiquitous adoption of healthcare systems using GLP-1’s from public health economic perspective**. As these medications become cheaper and cost savings from health outcomes are quantified, the cost of these medicines on healthcare systems will be offset by the longterm cost savings from a healthier population. For example, Currently Wegovy has been NICE approved for obesity in UK’s NHS, but in reality through my observation of practising there, access to these medicines is heavily restricted to level 3 obesity clinics, which in reality often is inaccessible to the vast majority of patients. I anticipate that there will be an inflexion point when prices of these medicines come down and the cost savings from widespread use and a healthier population makes ECONOMICAL sense to use Semaglutide ubiquitously. **- International Mistrust of US administration and decoupling**. Due to TRUMP economics, foreign policy and tariff agenda’s, the US is becoming a less stable partner to do business with. International Governments are going to decouple where possible and I think this will manifest and possibly harm US company contracts internationally, possibly leading to tailwinds for NVO in the international / non US market. Obviously pure speculation, but the sentiment around the World is getting increasingly frustrated. **THREATS** * **Political unrest and TRUMP’s US Administration** – this is currently a significant threat to Novonordisk, it is clear that this administration is hostile to novonordisk and will favour Eli Lilly and other American companies. This administration has also been targeting Greenland’s rare earth metals and I believe will target Danish interests in a hostile way to gain leverage over future trade negotiations. I suspect this is why NVO’s stock is extremely undervalued from financial KPI perspective. However, once resolved either through negotiations or through the end of TRUMPS administration, I believe this will act as further significant inflexion point and catalyst for NVO stock to rally. * **The end of GLP-1 Compounding ?** – Both Semaglutide and Tirzepatide has been removed from the “Emergency Shortage list” so it is now illegal for 3rd party companies to continue compounding these API’s. There is mounting FDA pressure and legal pressure on these rogue companies. The effectiveness of such pressures is yet to be determined. But the significant patient safety risks leads me to speculate that this practise has a limited runway. With Novonordisk’s US & Worldwide production capacity increasing and the end of legal compounding it’s a matter of time before tailwinds are seen through return of revenue streams. **Conclusion** I believe **Novo Nordisk** is significantly **undervalued** and offers an **attractive Value, Growth and Dividend Stock**. I’m a long-term Investor and predict in 2-5yrs time investors will be handsomely rewarded for the current turmoil they are enduring. **I believe Nov 2025 earnings will be the start of the stock turnaround.**",249,86,2025-10-26 08:23:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ogfa7o/novo_nordisk_nvo_nov_q3_2025_inflexion_point/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.058601,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'revenue', 'loss', 'acquisition']",1.0,Communication Services
T,1od2wys,wallstreetbets,🚛 Aurora Innovation (AUR): The Feds Just Fired the Starting Gun for Nationwide Driverless Trucking,"Position: 40,000 shares bought yesterday. My wife's boyfriend is pissed she doesn't have cash for luxury hotels anymore. Alright you magnificent degenerates, put down your grape juice boxes and your wife's boyfriend’s homework. While you’ve been torching money on trash tickers, something foundational just shifted: Aurora Innovation (AUR) didn't just get a win; they got a clear signal from the federal government that the era of nationwide autonomous freight is coming. And Aurora, with its OEM kingmakers and 'superhuman' tech, is the only one with the keys to the kingdom. On October 9, 2025, the Feds didn't just solve a small problem for Aurora. They showed their hand, revealing a clear intent to dismantle the single biggest obstacle to autonomous trucking: the dreaded ""patchwork"" of state-by-state regulations. Part 1: The Triangle Problem Is Dead Aurora runs Level 4 driverless trucks—freight runs, no human driver, no legally mandated breaks. The catch? An old-school federal rule required a human driver to get out and place three reflective triangles if a truck stops on the roadside. With no driver, Aurora was in a legal catch-22. This was a cornerstone of the bear case: * “The Feds will never adapt the rules for driverless.” * “A patchwork of 50 different state laws will kill them.” * “True commercialization is a fantasy.” On Oct 9, the FMCSA dropped the hammer: triangles are out, automated beacons are in. This is possible because Aurora’s tech isn't just a gadget; it's a full-stack perception system. Their proprietary FirstLight LiDAR can spot a pedestrian on the highway at night up to 11 seconds sooner than a human driver. When your truck can see hazards over a quarter-mile away, the idea of needing a human to hop out and place triangles becomes absurd. But here’s the kill shot: the waiver comes with federal preemption, meaning states are explicitly forbidden from enforcing conflicting rules on this issue. The Feds just drew a line in the sand. Full details here: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/carrier-safety/carrier-safety-resources/waiver-warning-device-requirements-effective-october Part 2: Aurora Didn’t Ask—They Fought and Won This wasn't a gift. They forced the government's hand. * Dec 2024: FMCSA denies Aurora’s initial request, citing a lack of specifics. Bears pop the champagne. * Jan 2025: Aurora sues the Department of Transportation, calling the denial “arbitrary and capricious” and arguing it ""stifles innovation"". * Oct 2025: FMCSA reverses course, works with Aurora, and grants a new, specific waiver that creates a clear, data-driven path forward. They proved that the federal government is no longer an immovable wall but a partner that can be compelled to find solutions for the autonomous age. Part 3: Why This Is the First Domino to Fall for Patchwork Regulation This is where you need to pay attention. This isn't just about triangles. This is a major strategic signal that the federal government is finally getting serious about creating a unified, national framework for autonomous vehicles. Here’s why this is bigger than it looks: * Precedent is Set: For the first time on a critical operational issue, the Feds have used their preemptive power to tell states to stand down. They have established the principle that where a federal, data-backed solution for AVs exists, it will be the law of the land. This is the first shot fired in the war against the patchwork nightmare. And Aurora is the perfect company for the Feds to partner with on this. They aren't some fly-by-night startup. They have deep, co-development partnerships with PACCAR (Peterbilt, Kenworth) and Volvo, who together command roughly 50% of the entire U.S. Class 8 truck market. When the government wants to create a national standard, they work with the 800-pound gorillas, not the monkeys. * A Federal Playbook is Emerging: The FMCSA's reversal shows a clear path forward. They denied a vague, industry-wide request but approved a specific, technically rigorous, and safety-focused solution. This creates a template for solving other human-centric rules. The message is clear: bring us the data, and we will modernize the rules. * Executive Action Aligns with Legislative Intent: This waiver perfectly complements the ""America Drives Act,"" a federal bill currently being pushed that would create a unified nationwide framework for AVs. That bill’s goal is to explicitly preempt state laws that would prohibit driverless trucks based on the absence of a human driver. The FMCSA's action is a down payment on that goal. The executive branch is laying the groundwork and signaling its support while Congress works to make it permanent. The entire federal apparatus is starting to move in the same direction. The bear case has always been that America’s fragmented regulatory system would strangle AV trucking in its crib. This waiver is the strongest evidence yet that the federal government recognizes that risk and is now actively working to mitigate it, creating a clear path for interstate commerce. Part 4: Why the Stock Still Looks Stuck So why isn’t the stock ripping? One word: Uber and its 🤡 financing deal. Back in May, Uber raised $1.15B in exchangeable notes tied to its Aurora stake. Hedge funds bought them, then shorted AUR to hedge. Short interest exploded from ~89M shares in April to >130M by May. This isn’t “hedgies betting against Aurora.” It’s just 🤡 math. But the effect is the same: constant, price-insensitive selling pressure, driving down the stock anytime it nears around $8.50. So we’ve got: * Fundamentals pointing to the moon → A landmark regulatory win that signals the beginning of the end for the patchwork problem. * Market mechanics pressing down → convert-arb shorts keeping the price stuck. That’s why the stock looks flat even though the entire long-term thesis just got massively de-risked. Part 5: The Bull Case - Why Aurora Owns the Road Ahead So with the biggest regulatory threat neutralized, let's talk about why Aurora is set to dominate the now-open field. * The OEM Moat: Aurora’s strategy is a fortress. Their partnerships with PACCAR and Volvo aren’t just logos on a slide; they are deep, multi-year integrations to build autonomous-ready trucks from the factory floor up. A competitor can't just copy this. This creates a massive barrier to entry and a direct sales channel to half the industry. * The Competition is Dead: While Aurora was building this moat, the competition was self-destructing. TuSimple? Imploded in a storm of SEC investigations and shady dealings with China, delisted from NASDAQ, and is now pivoting to AI gaming tech. Embark? Ran out of money and shut down. Waymo? Alphabet's golden child deprioritized its trucking division to focus on robotaxis in cities and in the process is helping normalize vehicle autonomy to the public. And Kodiak, while alive, is a small private player with a fraction of Aurora’s miles, partners, and capital. They’re not a serious threat at national scale. Aurora is effectively the last scaled U.S. player standing. The field has been cleared and the reality of autonomous vehicles is rapidly being normalized. * The Tech Edge: Aurora’s 'Driver' is built around its proprietary FirstLight LiDAR, which has a range of over 450 meters—critical for stopping a fully-loaded 80,000-pound rig at highway speeds. This isn't just about staying in the lane; it's about superhuman perception that underpins their entire safety case. * The Multi-Billion Dollar Prize: So what’s the payoff? The realistic, serviceable market for long-haul autonomous trucking is estimated to be $44.5 billion annually by 2035. In the bull case, Aurora, with its OEM moat and cleared competitive field, could plausibly capture 25-50% of that. Let's run the numbers for you apes: a 25% share is over $11 billion in high-margin, recurring revenue. Slap a conservative 10x sales multiple on that (standard for a 'Driver as a Service' model), and you’re looking at a $111 billion market cap. From today’s $9.45 billion, that’s a 10-bagger, and that's not even the most optimistic scenario. Conclusion: The Road Is Being Cleared Aurora still has hurdles—scaling production with its OEM partners and proving the economics—but the single greatest strategic threat, a federal government unwilling to solve the state patchwork problem, is dissolving. The fundamental bull case just got a massive injection of rocket fuel, but the price is still on the launchpad thanks to the short-sellers. And you know what that means for this rocket. This isn’t financial advice (except for my wife's boyfriend). But if you’re looking for an asymmetric setup, this is it: the government is clearing the road, the competition has crashed and burned, and Aurora is leading the convoy with half the entire trucking industry riding shotgun. Strap yourself in and come along for the ride. 🚀",130,152,2025-10-22 08:46:01,https://i.redd.it/s95r0xm5mmwf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:42:40.567307,0.4,$T,1.0,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'shorts', 'moon', 'rocket', 'support', 'market cap', 'revenue']",0.9457142857142856,Communication Services
T,1ocatkw,ValueInvesting,The Dip of the Dip of the Dip for NVO,"You don’t see pullbacks like this very often, let alone from a company that has quietly dominated its space for over a century like NVO. If you already have a balanced, diversified portfolio, adding a small % here feels like a gift. The market keeps hammering it down, and sentiment has flipped so hard that people are forgetting that the they are a global leader with monstrous cash flow, pricing power, and unmatched brand strength. If you’re sitting on red and can’t stomach another average down (or “buy the dip of the dip of the dip” as it’s starting to feel), I completely get it. BUT, if you’re looking for quality, long-term growth, and actual durability, then do not go skipping over NVO right now just because the chart looks ugly. This company has been the backbone of diabetes care for decades, and now it’s expanding into obesity, cardiometabolic, and next-gen therapies...including their upcoming oral GLP-1 pills. Their smaller R&D bets could turn into legitimate moonshots. On a cash flow basis, it’s trading at a discount to plenty of companies that don’t even come close in terms of stability or dominance. Time and time again, people bail during these drawdowns, and time and time again, the strong names recover. Unless you think the global demand for diabetes and obesity care is about to vanish overnight, this selloff looks more like a setup than a warning. These dips are what we live for!!! Historically, here is when you get paid for having conviction. Not calling for a rocket back to ATHs tomorrow, but 135–150 looks like a very fair range once sentiment normalizes.

T,1o6qwae,stocks,American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) quietly building a U.S. lithium recycling powerhouse,"Hey everyone, I’ve been digging into American Battery Technology Company (ABAT) lately, and I think this one deserves way more attention than it’s getting. With the renewed U.S. China tariff tensions, Washington is pushing hard to rebuild domestic control over critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 80% of global lithium refining happens in China. That’s a huge strategic vulnerability for the U.S. and Europe. Tariffs and supply disruptions have reminded everyone that if you can’t refine it yourself, you’re at someone else’s mercy so it seems. That’s exactly where ABAT fits in in my opinion. They’re an American company building American lithium capacity, supported by U.S. grants and policy. Their work directly aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act’s push for U.S. sourced battery materials, and that could mean long-term funding, tax incentives, and federal partnerships. With the current tariff issue with China, its helping ABAT’s positioning, pushing investment and attention toward homegrown battery material companies. They’re basically trying to close the full loop of the U.S. battery supply chain from recycling spent batteries, to extracting lithium from domestic resources to refining battery-grade materials. In a world that’s moving fast toward EVs and energy storage, that’s a pretty unique position. * Revenues are actually starting to ramp Q4 FY25 revenue up over 180% QoQ, showing their recycling operations are gaining traction. * Operating costs down 30% YoY, meaning they’re tightening efficiency while scaling. * Strong U.S. government support, multiple DOE grants + a $900M Letter of Interest from U.S. EXIM Bank for their Tonopah Flats lithium project. * Added to the Russell 2000 index, which brings more institutional visibility. ABAT is building infrastructure that America actually needs if it wants to compete in lithium and battery materials. Their focus on sustainable recycling + domestic lithium refining could put them in a sweet spot as demand skyrockets and the U.S. pushes for local supply chains. They’ve been through the cash burn and early stage pain already, but management seems to be getting costs under control and executing better lately. They’re not profitable yet and still rely on external funding - but for a small-cap with government backing, real assets, and visible progress, it feels like the risk/reward looks promising given the above in my opinion. If they can get Tonopah Flats into production and keep growing recycling throughput, this could evolve from a microcap story to a serious U.S. battery materials player over the next few years in my opinion. Curious if anyone else is following ABAT or has thoughts on their Tonopah project? I’m long, holding. Would love to hear other DD or perspectives from people in the battery/materials space.

T,1o334r8,ValueInvesting,I’m getting mixed signals,"I go on CNBC and see all these talking heads talk about a bubble, and how it’s related to the 1990s, and I think there is more room to run. However another one of my top indicators is retail buying into the market like a bunch of retards. Inflows have gone from 5 billion back in summer to 7 billion a week now. A 40% increase. When I look at fundamentals for the AI trade, truly all that matters is that Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and the hyperscalers don’t slowdown their spending. From how it sounds with this AMD/Open AI deal we are not getting that slowdown anytime soon, in fact they need even more compute than they thought. Now when I look at forward valuations on the S&P 500 it sits at 23 times is forward price to earnings, and on the Nasdaq its 27 times forward earnings. Price to sales for the S&P 500 is 3.39, and for the Nasdaq its 6.32. Now yes these valuations are rich on a historical basis, but if AI makes these companies efficiently go up they can increase revenue and margins, and that’s the big question nobody can answer right now. If these companies can grow and expand their revenues and margins in the next few years we are not in a bubble and valuations are justified, if it takes 10 years to implement AI like it did the internet we could be flat for some time.

T,1okq33l,ValueInvesting,Anyone else getting weird vibes from the NVO hype lately? Faint smell of bag holder mentality...,"I've been watching the Novo Nordisk talk here and honestly, something just feels off. On fundamentals, it doesn’t really scream “value stock”, at least not in the way this sub used to define it. I get it, the market’s been a tough place to find true value lately, but the tone around NVO feels different. It’s like half the posts are from genuine believers, and the other half are from people who got in too high and are trying to talk themselves (and everyone else) into holding/buying. There’s this faint smell of bag-holder psychology creeping in, and it’s making me second-guess what’s actually driving the enthusiasm.

Nothing wrong with growth or speculation, but it’s a different game. Value investing isn’t about chasing the next Duolingo or Virgin Galactic. It’s about buying businesses at a discount to their intrinsic value with a margin of safety; typically low multiples, strong free cash flow, and balance sheets that can survive cycles. Think boring cash cows.

T,1op8z98,wallstreetbets,$SEZL Long and strong,"*Summary*: $SEZL is down 67% from its peak because the market is full of paper-handed morons who can't read. They panicked over a seasonal take-rate dip and ""muh subprime"" fears from 2008. Meanwhile, the actual business metrics are accelerating, it's run by a founder-CEO who hasn't sold a share, and it's printing cash (123% rev growth + 35% net margin in Q1). The smart money PDF says this is a 5x to 8x bagger from here. Get in before the suits figure it out. 🚀 Part 1: Why did it dip? (aka Why is everyone else an idiot?) So, your wife's boyfriend saw the chart and panicked. The stock rocketed to $185 after stellar Q1 earnings, then crashed to $63. The market thinks the party's over. Here's why they're wrong: The ""Take Rate"" Misunderstanding: • The smooth-brains saw revenue growth ""slow"" from 123% in Q1 to 76% in Q2 and shit their pants. They think this is a ""massive deceleration."" WRONG. • That insane Q1 take rate (13.0%) was seasonal. All the Christmas shopping (Q4 GMV) gets paid off in Q1, artificially juicing the revenue number. This happens every year. •While the paper-hands were looking at the seasonal rate, the actual business was accelerating. GMV growth sped up from 64% in Q1 to 75% in Q2. Active consumers and transactions are also up. •Management also chose to invest in growth, like pushing the ""On Demand"" product (which has a lower take rate initially) to get more subscribers later. This is called playing the long game. •The ""Subprime"" Ghost: All the boomer analysts hear ""subprime"" and think the Big Short is happening again. This is not your daddy's 30-year NINJA loan. •These are 6-week, small-dollar loans. The company gets its first read on a loan in 14 days, not 14 months. •The risk isn't the whole economy; it's just new customers. The repeat customers (who make up most of the volume) are proven, loyal cash-cows. •Sezzle can literally just turn off the new-customer tap if they see trouble. They have a big red button. Your bank doesn't. •The Hindenburg (R.I.P. Bozo) Attack: Remember Hindenburg? They tried to short this company into the ground in November 2024. Sezzle won, and Hindenburg literally went bankrupt. This company already had its near-death experience when it had 1-2 months of cash left and clawed its way back. Your short thesis is nothing. Part 2: The Rocket Fuel (Why we're going to the moon 🌕) This isn't just a comeback story; it's a ""print you tendies"" story. •Papa Charlie (The Main Character): This isn't run by some diversity-hire suit. It's run by founder-CEO Charlie Youakim. He's a tech-oriented engineer who owns a massive stake and has never sold a single f*cking share. He even took a margin loan instead of selling. That's how bullish he is. 💎👐 • It. Prints. Money. This isn't some cash-burning Silicon Valley trash. This is a profitable growth monster. Q1 2025 Stats: * Revenue Growth: 123% YoY * Net Margin: 35% * It Broke the Goddamn Chart: You see that ""Rule of 40"" image? That's the benchmark for high-quality SaaS companies. A score of 40 is good. $SEZL's score in Q1? ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-EIGHT. It's not on the chart. It's the red arrow pointing to the dot in another dimension. It's the most profitable and fastest-growing, yet the market gives it the lowest multiple. •We Are EARLY: Why is this golden goose so cheap? Because nobody knows it exists. •It has only 4 analyst ratings. For a $2.5B company, that's criminally low. •It's based in Minnesota, not some SF soy-den. The Wall Street dweebs haven't found it yet. •The really big money is just starting to get in. Renaissance, Goldman Sachs, and Joel Greenblatt all bought in last quarter. The market is giving you a 67% discount on the best-in-class, most profitable, founder-led company in the entire BNPL sector. The thesis paper I read is modeling a 5x to 8x MOIC (that's ""Multiple on Invested Capital,"" for you apes) by 2027. This isn't financial advice. I'm just an idiot on the internet.

T,1oe4778,stocks,Target (TGT) Earnings Move,"So everyone that got burned on BYND and looking for a win I have the solution for you. I see people ask all the time how someone finds out about a stock move early. I did great on Rocket Lab, UUUU, OPEN, and made some off BYND. Today I’m looking at Target and its recent breakout from the trend line and moving up. Target often runs up to earnings and then either takes off or dumps. Target is down around 37% for the year but up 8% over the last couple of weeks. It has shown strength even when the market as a whole dumps. That means institutional buyers are likely coming in since it is 80% held by institutions. Not only is this the start of the move. Earnings are less than a month away so this is heading back above $100 a share. Target has a PE of 11 while Walmart has a PE of 40. This is the bargain play. Why am I bullish on Target beating earning? Bank earnings have been good and they are all saying the same thing….the consumer is spending like crazy and pretty resilient. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the undeniable facts on the consumer side: “resilience, strong spending, and delinquency rates lower than expected.” Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf observed positive consumer health indicators, stating, “We’ve seen robust consumer spending and stable deposits, which collectively paint a picture of a consistently strong consumer base.” He further highlighted the continued growth in spending on debit and credit cards, as well as the strong year-over-year growth in auto loan originations. Additionally, Scharf noted the steady growth in total client assets within Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management businesses. This isn’t going to 100% tomorrow like a BYND or OPEN but it can do 10% in a month and that is a solid gain. Calls are cheap but will get more expensive as earnings get closer. Also pays almost 5% dividend for my true investors out there. It has less shares outstanding than Open and barely more the BYND. Prediction: $105-$110 prior to earnings. Gap up after earnings if it’s a solid beat.

T,1ojcphv,wallstreetbets,Core Scientific (CORZ) - DD,"The unforgotten gem in AI / data center space. People often mention $CIFR, $WULF, $APLD, but $CORZ is not talked about enough. Let’s begin by addressing the real bottleneck in AI growth: power. The more access to immediate power you have now, the more big tech are willing to pay. What data center companies have isn’t special, any big tech company can build a data center, but they need it NOW and in near future and these projects take years (to secure power from Utility company, to then build transformers/substations, and then construction of actual building + deployment of liquid cooling and GPUs). RIOT’s latest estimate for when they can get new power from Utility company is from 36 months - 48 months depending on the area in the US. If you have power already contracted, you are in a perfect position to take advantage of AI demand. What does CORZ have? They have 1.3GW in power active, and a 1GW pipeline. 700MW of these form a critical load of 590MW which they’ve leased out to CRWV for $10.9B over 12 years. Their margins on this colocation deal are 80%. They will have this power ready by H2 2026. This means starting next year, they will generate $908M in revenue annually, and $720M in annual profit in 2027+. This is only for the 590MW of critical load to CRWV. They have 90MW of critical load to also lease out (active) for AI, and another 400MW dedicated to BTC (if they’re smart they say scratch that let’s also use it for AI). What they also have is a 1GW pipeline to expand into. At $20.4 the company is 6.4B market cap. Super undervalued. Only issue: this hanging acquisition from CRWV. The board meeting for when shareholders vote FOR or AGAINST this is TOMORROW: October 30, 2025 at 10AM ET. The deal basically says for every CORZ share you get 0.1235 CRWV shares in an all equity stock deal. The issue is as of October 29, the deal is at a negative spread of 22%. CRWV price is $135. CORZ price is $20.5. Means if shareholders vote yes tomorrow, they lose 22% of their money then and there. Hence, they’re pricing in a NO vote. The biggest active shareholder Two Seas Capital, has urged investors to vote AGAINST this deal. Situational awareness which owns almost 10% of the company has kept increasing their stake of the company from about 3% to 10%, over the last 2 months. CORZ position is now 35% of their total portfolio. I don’t think they kept increasing their position to lose 22% tomorrow, hence the NO vote. After this deal is done, I expect the two companies prices to no longer fluctuate together, and I expect a massive rally in CORZ. Position posted. Best of luck.",40,23,2025-10-29 18:37:15,https://i.redd.it/k3jxmws0i3yf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:42:40.552607,0.4,$T,1.0,"['CIFR', 'CORZ', 'WULF', 'APLD']","['rally', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'acquisition']",0.8285714285714285,Communication Services

Then the stock popped 10% today, so sorry you all missed out on that. But anyway, I think it's got more to climb so hopefully this is useful. My original post is below, as well as a screenshot of my positions.

That is the stock I am going to recommend you buy today. At least you know you won't be buying at an ATH. My positions: 362 shares of ENPH at \~$30 per share. I plan to continue to invest into Enphase over the next few months. https://preview.redd.it/kw76wqn30jzf1.png?width=2508&format=png&auto=webp&s=18847b813e89c69affcab3e2b3974fb9696047fd At the time of writing, ENPH is down 60% YTD. However, I expect/hope to see significant upwards price movement over the next year for the following reasons. 1. Electricity prices are rising across the US; Enphase products enable residential (and now commercial) customers to generate their own electricity. 2. Interest rates are falling. Many customers take out loans to install PV systems; lower interest rates = cheaper loans = more PV systems sold. This pairs nicely with point 1) above. 3. ENPH has moved much of their production into the United States, reducing exposure to tariff nonsense. 4. The big kicker: **Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)**. The US electricity grid is old AF and unable to handle growing electricity loads. Upgrading the grid is expensive. Virtual Power Plants are basically an interconnected web of end customers who agree that the utility can reduce their electricity use (say, pause or slow down charging on an EV) at times of high electricity demand. Enphase has [partnered with Kraken](https://investor.enphase.com/news-releases/news-release-details/enphase-energy-expands-virtual-power-plant-support-across-europe) to offer VPPs in Europe. VPPs allow utilities to avoid building expensive new power plants and transmission lines by simply reducing the ""peak"" amount of energy the utility needs to provide at any given time. VPPs are present in the United States (Enphase already offers support for [VPP programs in Colorado](https://investor.enphase.com/news-releases/news-release-details/enphase-energy-expands-its-support-grid-services-programs-0)) but it seems likely that more states and utilities will look to VPPs to limit the cost of grid investments. 5. Speaking of Kraken, it's a name you'll also want to get familiar with. And no, I'm not referring to the [Kraken crypto platform](https://www.kraken.com), which, confusingly, is also expected to IPO next year. The Kraken I'm referring to is a SaaS company helping utilities modernize their operating systems, including using AI to help manage electricity loads. It's probably one of the most non-regarded AI companies out there, and it is expected to IPO next year and will probably moon. But don't take my word for it, here's a few news articles saying as much: * The Wall Street Journal, September 18, 2025: [Octopus Energy to Spin Off AI Arm Kraken to Create Potential $15 Billion Software Platform. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/octopus-energy-to-spin-off-ai-arm-kraken-to-create-potential-15-billion-software-platform-281d9a8c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfL3njYC_7fnwYxEH1w8l-NZs1VLTczRO0TOXAWXhpLra6KeYG_tG_auv0Nvm0%3D&gaa_ts=690a97e2&gaa_sig=HeHBy_7ynCEs-nc4VuNVYCxhHUYEembNOYifBTom6IQ7tWdo3VpnZblh3TxcClHTdhRvdSwHvCYX5aEHd1qKfw%3D%3D) * The Economist, April 9, 2025: [AI models can help generate cleaner power](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/04/09/ai-models-can-help-generate-cleaner-power). 6. The U.S. Distributed Energy Resource (DER) market (which includes VPPs) is expected to [grow significantly over the next five years. ](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/wood-mackenzie-sees-217-gw-new-distributed-energy-resources-2028/720581/)Enphase is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth - they're already doing this stuff in Europe. 7. On Friday, October 31 (spooky), the CEO [bought 10k shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543777/000154377725000004/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1762207678.xml) for about $300,000. Maybe it's a smoke screen but it makes me feel better buying at this price point. 8. The underlying company actually makes money. I know, it's crazy, but I think that ENPH is one of the few companies with actual positive cash flow that is ALSO tied to a real-world use case of AI (through its VPP product offerings) and ALSO is in an industry segment that could see some real crazy meme stock growth potential soon. Right now, all the attention is on data centers, and lots of stocks tied to the provision of energy to data centers have gone nuts. I think that VPPs have the chance to hop on the same train and Enphase is one of the publicly traded stocks that will benefit from this. **Downside risks:** Number 1 is that certain solar tax credits expire at the end of the year. This could really hurt Enphase's numbers early next year, though I hope this will be offset by higher electricity prices and lower interest rates. We'll probably have a better understanding of the realized impact after Q1 earnings in the spring. Number 2 is that Tesla just eats the entire VPP market, which is a possibility. Number 3 is that the VPPs don't really become a thing, which probably limits the moon potential of ENPH. That's it. That's the post. Thanks for reading.

T,1o5nghn,financialindependence,Unexpected Gift / FIRE Questions,"Long time listener, first time caller. I’ve been on some sort of FIRE path for the past 11 or so years, since leaving graduate school. I (39M) am married with two kids, and until about 18 months ago lived in a VHCOL area; I’m now working mostly remotely in a MCOL area, and although we miss many specific things about city living, life is overall better and calmer and more manageable now living in a smaller town. To date, I’ve not been someone who has made / consistently updates FIRE models, although I do play around with that type of analysis occasionally. Generally, we’re sort of boring and average on the FIRE spectrum. Some facts before I get to the meat of the post: \-I gross about $120K per year and my wife has historically made about the same salary as me, but is now venturing out on her own as a freelancer; let’s call household income $200K currently, and about $250K in the last few years. \-Our non-real estate net worth is just about $1M ($950K as of this past week). $50K HYSA, $100K brokerage/post-tax, and $800K across IRAs and 401ks (about $500K traditional and $300K ROTH). Effectively all of the investments are in VTSAX. \-As may be obvious when looking at the net worth breakdown, the past 10 years we have focused on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for both my wife and I, with relatively little left over for post-tax investments. Daycare costs in a VHCOL killed us for a year or two, but with one kid in public school now and being in a generally lower-cost area, we’ve been able to do a little more post-tax investment recently. \-We were lucky and got a low interest rate mortgage - 2.9% - in 2021 on a little condo in our VHCOL area, and we lived there until recently. We are now renting this apartment out, and the rent proceeds cover our mortgage/interest, property tax, HOA, and a general upkeep fund, with no “profit.” We have $500K left on the mortgage, and the theoretical market value is around 800K. \-Our plan to date has been to be work-optional around age 50, and we seem to be on a decent path for that, provided we shift our investment activity in the coming decade from 401k maxing to post-tax. We both like our lines of work, and we obviously are not grinding soul-crushing jobs for correspondingly high pay. But neither of us want to be trading our time for money, and the sooner neither of us have to do that - particularly my wife - the better. We don’t want to be “retired” so much as unencumbered. There are about a million things we’d like to make and projects we’d like to do and places we’d like to see without having to worry about the expectation of those things creating money for us (or stopping us from creating money). If they do, great; if not, we’d love the luxury of that not being a problem. We’ve also both experienced unexpected losses of dear friends that have really clarified the preciousness of time. We’d like to be as present for our kids as possible as they grow up (and being in a smaller town / lower cost area has already helped with that). But, here is the rub - when we moved to the MCOL area, my wife’s parents offered to buy the new house outright and effectively structure a lower interest mortgage for us; we could get a conventional mortgage in the future when rates came down. We didn’t realize they even had the ability to do this, but they had themselves recently received a large inheritance from my wife’s grandmother. Then, six months ago, they told us that the loan was absolved, and that we should consider the house as part of my wife’s inheritance. They told us they wanted to put their inheritance, and their own excess savings, to use for my wife and her sisters while everyone was still alive and healthy rather than bequeathing it all upon their deaths. It was a lovely and completely unexpected gesture, and frankly both my wife and I still don’t really know how to contextualize this gift alongside our previous 10 years of fairly determined grinding in a very expensive area of the country. We also probably wouldn't have accepted if they had initially offered to simply buy the house for us with no expectation of repayment, and I think they knew that! So, after all the preamble, the question is - how does a gift like this change the FIRE math? The very concept of FIRE? We had assumed we would be paying some kind of a mortgage on a timeline that would roughly align with our financial independence; perhaps until our mid-50s. Now, suddenly, we have a paid off house. We had been pretty locked in on our +/- age 50 path and the mindset that went along with it; now it seems feasible for, say, one of us to stop working for a salary much earlier if we so desire. Or for one of us to take a sabbatical, so to speak, and not worry about maximum investing for a year. Put in the simplest terms, our net worth went from about $1.2M to about $1.7M with the stroke of a pen, but that additional net worth is simultaneously illiquid, eliminates the biggest single expense on our balance sheet, and provides a very deep sense of security that I hadn’t really known before. This gift is also very humbling, and has both of us thinking about gratitude. Put another way, yes, we can now just shift the mortgage payment directly into post-tax investments. That’s a simple way to conceptualize the change, and it’s basically what we’ve been doing in 2025. But is that the best use of this gift? Has anyone here ever been in a situation similar to this type of windfall, and if so, did it / how did it alter your thinking? This post seems to have turned out to be a weird mix of some but not all useful numbers and philosophical questions, so happy to provide any specific info if that’s helpful. Thanks in advance.",24,12,2025-10-13 15:50:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1o5nghn/unexpected_gift_fire_questions/,2025-11-07 16:44:36.094134,0.4,$T,0.5,[],"['rally', 'profit', 'loss']",0.8171428571428571,Communication Services

T,1o676w7,stocks,$LAES - SEALSQ’s validation cycle with Landis+Gyr,"The Landis+Gyr × SEALSQ partnership news directly reinforces & extends my earlier thesis about SEALSQ’s positioning in the quantum-secure hardware narrative & it gives the argument a new real-world validation anchor. Here’s how: SEALSQ is already positioned at the rare, tangible end of the quantum spectrum: actually producing secure chips while others float on hype. The Landis+Gyr announcement functions as empirical verification. SEALSQ’s hardware isn’t theoretical; it’s being integrated at scale into utility infrastructure, beyond R&D slides. Landis+Gyr explicitly cites SEALSQ’s quantum-resistant chips & PKI services, an admission that quantum-safe hardware has moved from a speculative virtue signal to regulatory & commercial requirement. In short, the ‘regulatory’ momentum I flagged (NIST, ENISA, CISA) is materializing through OEM pipelines, translating policy inevitability into partnerships. SEALSQ is building tangible chips. Now, endorsed by a heavyweight in grid technology. Landis+Gyr isn’t some boutique pilot partner; it’s embedded in utility infrastructure across North America. Their CSO’s statement makes it explicit. Quantum-safe integration isn’t a demo, it’s a policy horizon for critical systems. This shifts SEALSQ’s profile entirely: from a microcap with a clever narrative to a strategic supplier embedded in regulated infrastructure. My earlier post correctly positioned SEALSQ as a beneficiary of the compliance wave driven by NIST, CISA, etc. The Landis+Gyr partnership now closes that loop. A validation cycle: Regulated utilities begin integrating SEALSQ hardware → Compliance agencies spotlight the early adopters → Analysts recalibrate their models around ‘quantum-resilient infrastructure’ → SEALSQ harvests momentum from both regulatory mandate & procurement inertia. In effect, this deal converts narrative into traction. It anchors the speculative premium to something the market can finally price in. From a trade & valuation standpoint, the deal reinforces my argument that SEALSQ’s modest speculative multiple is positioned for re-rating as capital migrates from theoretical quantum narratives to deployable post-quantum security. It also provides rational justification for long OTM calls into December.",16,3,2025-10-14 05:35:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o676w7/laes_sealsqs_validation_cycle_with_landisgyr/,2025-11-07 16:43:10.791087,0.4,$T,0.9,['LAES'],['calls'],0.8057142857142856,Communication Services
T,1o3ewij,stocks,Apple nears deal to acquire talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI,"Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company’s technology, CNBC has learned. Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don’t end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC. The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting. Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab. Xiao and Darrell didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment. Investors will get paid some money in the deal but “won’t be made whole,” executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation. Prompt’s flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what’s been happening in front of the camera. Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI’s technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn’t. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said. Silicon Valley’s tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple’s deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta’s $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company’s founder and other execs, and Google’s $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf’s CEO and leaders that included licensing fees. Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple’s biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines. Some analysts have attributed Apple’s relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps. While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker’s foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users. Prompt’s technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple’s HomeKit smart home division.

T,1ok0rg1,stocks,Trump–Xi summit: Tactical truce or real easing in trade tensions?,"Last night, President Trump and China’s President Xi met in Busan during the APEC summit. The tone was optimistic, but beneath the surface, the deal seems more like a temporary pause than a real breakthrough. Trump announced that the U.S. will roll back tariffs on Chinese imports from roughly **57% to 47%**, in exchange for China resuming soybean purchases and suspending rare-earth export restrictions for one year. However, the deeper structural issues, advanced tech access, chip exports, industrial policy, and the broader U.S.–China decoupling were left untouched. Markets reacted positively to the short-term relief, but many analysts are calling it exactly what it looks like: a **tactical ceasefire**, not a strategic reset. Both sides seem to be buying time rather than solving the core problems. For traders, this could mean a temporary risk-on mood, but the underlying volatility isn’t gone just delayed.

T,1op7pc1,investing,Private Trader - The Equation of Defense,"Let’s dive right in! In my previous posts, I mentioned how the time to be on the defensive, and I mean ultra-defensive, is now! The market isn’t going to wait for one to make moves after-the-fact, and that fact is drawing ever-so-near; the end of the data-blackout period and the clarity that follows. This morning, I initiated multiple moves within my portfolio. Trimmed a portion of a strongly defensive equity to free up more cash flow, then used that liquidity to start another defensive position elsewhere. I also repositioned myself within U.S. Treasuries, and will continue to do so as the days, weeks progress At the moment, I still hold roughly +15 % of my entire portfolio in a pure cash state; AKA further ammunition waiting for the right triggers, for my equations to beep the time has arrived, and its literally in week(s) if not day(s). **The “Validity” Period** The equations I use have gone through endless rebirths; built, broken, re-engineered, and broken again and again and again, many times over. They evolve because the market itself is alive, dynamic; it breathes, morphs, deceives and many-more-adjectives-in-between. If your strategy doesn’t move with that pulse, then you've effectively surrendered yourself to it. And surrender not! Every equation has what I call a ""validity"" period; think of it like a brief window where the alignment between structure and reality actually holds and once that fades, the entire construct decays, and so does whatever equation, whatever ""eureka"" or else you might have; in simple words, your ""edge"". The more in-tune you are with that cycle, the better you capture what matters most: profit. I use ChatGPT for many things, I consider it a sidekick-of-sorts; it makes many mistakes that anger-me-daily! Its a tool among tools, and many of these tools are purely static-in-form; the market is not. Your equations must adapt; their validity shifts and you must not treat the market as a constant; it is not. Never was, never will be. Your mission is to stay dynamic, to see when the rhythm changes and pivot; once you adopt that mentality, you stop chasing perfection and start synchronizing with volatility itself. **The “Reset” Period** My prime directive since day-1, in 2020, is capital preservation. Always has been, always will be. My goal isn’t to win every trade, even though thats what we all want to achieve, but more importantly so, is to ensure that no matter what storm hits, the portfolio survives to fight another day. One of my key frameworks is the reset of risk where constantly realize capital, not because I fear the market, but because I respect the cycles it goes through. When I bank profit, be it 2%, 5 %, or whatever it might be, I've effectively sterilized that capital, and this in turn allows me to redeploy it into another depending on the equations I work with. This constant recalibration reduces a great deal of emotional weight, it’s not about chasing every move; it’s about staying alive long enough to strike when conviction meets alignment. Simple in theory; brutal in execution. I failed many times over to get this through my brain. **The “Control” Period** Every single trader on earth has a small zone of control, their own true variable; some have more than others, but essentially its a slice of the equation that belongs entirely to you and one that you actually have control over; the rest belongs to noise, data, liquidity, etc. Mastering that small variable is everything; it's what truly constitutes your ""edge"", and ego is your kryptonite! Overconfidence further blinds you, and if your able to detach enough to autopsy both your wins and your failures, you start learning from both. Every time you do, be it win or less, further compounds your instinct! Control here doesn’t mean dominance; rather it means awareness! And that awareness becomes your rhythm, a variable that never grows because of arrogance; it grows through humility, repetition, and brutal honesty to ones self. **The “Shock” Period** Repetition can dull the mind and make you numb as you constantly repeat trades, over and over, it breeds complacency; this is why I inject controlled chaos into my system in order to ""awaken"" the senses if you will. In essence, I take a small, low-risk position in something untested, like a live experiment but not a gamble, not a YOLO; here it’s not really about chasing returns-per-say, but it’s about keeping the blade sharp where capital at risk changes how you think as it compresses your focus and exposes your instinct, your edge; think of it like ""shock positions” that tune-up the brain. Every single win, loss, or else adds further dimensions to the entire process your undertaking. **The “Defensive” Period** Today’s portfolio shifts reflects everything above; I trimmed one position at breakeven to free liquidity, initiated a new highly defensive equity right after its earnings came out, and re-entered a previously sold name after its price faded taking it back within my ""zone-of-comfort"". Each of these have dual purposes; yield and resilience. A dividend that protects the unknown, and the potential for capital appreciation which further compounds. We’re entering the phase where the illusion-of-today could break down any minute; where the fake pieces of this overall puzzle start to drop and the reality of the image emerges in its raw and unsanitized form. Defensive positioning isn’t hesitation, it's foresight, it’s the architecture that keeps you standing. Time will tell how this next sequence plays out, we're not too far out from it. Stay sharp, stay adaptive, stay alive; Peace out and till the next one!",0,6,2025-11-05 16:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1op7pc1/private_trader_the_equation_of_defense/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.263798,0.4,$T,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'yolo', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss', 'eps']",0.74,Communication Services
T,1oq68zk,wallstreetbets,Why Super Micro computer is the obvious play,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI) remains a high-conviction play in the AI infrastructure space, leveraging its rack-scale server expertise and tight Nvidia partnerships to capture explosive demand. Despite a post-earnings dip to ~$42 (down ~10% on Nov 5), the stock trades at an undemanding valuation, setting up asymmetric upside as deferred revenues unlock in Q2. With a massive >$14B order backlog and expanding manufacturing capacity, SMCI is positioned for multi-year growth in the AI data center buildout—think hyperscalers upgrading to Blackwell GPUs at scale. Q1 FY26 Results & Updated Q2 Guidance: Q1 revenue came in at $5.02B (miss vs. $6.09B est., -18% QoQ), with EPS at $0.35 (vs. $0.41 est.), pressured by ~$1.8B in deferred rack shipments tied to customer validations and supply chain timing. Margins held steady at ~14.5%, reflecting cost controls amid volume ramps. However, the real story is the new Q2 guidance, upgraded in the earnings call to reflect full deferred recognition: official range of $5.9B–$6.2B, but management explicitly signaled “double-digit potential” (10B+), driven by Q1 deferrals + accelerated Blackwell system deployments. Analysts (e.g., Rosenblatt, Barclays) model $9–11B for Q2—a ~100% QoQ surge—aligning with FY26 full-year outlook now raised to ≥$36B. This isn’t organic weakness; it’s a classic timing shift, with no lost orders. Current Valuation: At $42, SMCI trades at a rock-bottom ~0.7x FY26 P/S (on $36B rev guidance), vs. peers like Dell (1.2x) and HPE (1.0x)—and that’s before baking in the Q2 upside to 40–44B annualized run-rate. Forward P/E ~15x on expected $2.80+ EPS, with ROIC accelerating on AI margins. The dip embeds bearish fears of volatility, but ignores the backlog’s strength and capex tailwinds (Malaysia/USA factories at full tilt). Historical Pattern & Catalysts: SMCI’s playbook is consistent: Q1/Q2 “misses” on deferrals (3/3 since 2024), followed by Q3/Q4 beats (avg. +10% vs. est., +50–180% stock gains over 3–12 months). Q2 here mirrors Q1’24’s setup but with 2x the backlog and Nvidia’s GPU guarantees. Key catalysts: Blackwell validation completions (Dec), hyperscaler wins (5+ in queue), and no major bottlenecks.

T,1obu1a7,ValueInvesting,[Hidden Compounders] G. Willi-Food ($WILC) - Fairly Valued Small Cap with Strong Compounding Potential,"Further on my quest to find hidden compounders, I’ve been looking into G. Willi-Food International ($WILC), an Israeli food distributor that’s quietly delivering consistent growth and profitability. It’s a simple, cash-generative business that looks fairly valued with upside potential if management executes well. **Quick business overview**: WILC markets and distributes food products like canned goods, dairy substitutes, and oils under its own brands and private labels. It operates mainly in Israel but also exports internationally. With a market cap around $200M to 300M, it’s largely ignored by analysts but I think it serves a stable, recurring-demand sector (food staples). Recent results have been strong: record revenue and profit in 2024, growing margins, and consistent dividends. Operating Margins and ROIC both in the 10% range. It’s not flashy, but it’s a durable business with a long operating history and solid fundamentals. **Valuation**: I think it's slightly undervalued to fairly valued. P/E ratio of 9 and P/S ratio of 1.5 are in-line with what you'd expect for a consumer staples business. Balance sheet is healthy, margins are improving, with consistent cash generation and a history of prudent capital management. Revenue is growing and positive operating leverage means even modest top-line growth can lift EPS faster. Plus, its small size leaves room for organic and M&A-driven expansion. **Risks**: WILC faces some notable risks typical of a small international distributor. Being based in Israel exposes it to geopolitical and currency fluctuations that can affect operations and margins. Competition in the food distribution space is intense, and its small scale could limit pricing power or growth if expansion proves costly. Finally, the stock’s low liquidity and modest valuation could make it a potential value trap if margin improvements stall. **Bottom Line**: WILC strikes me as a straightforward, resilient business with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and steadily improving margins. It’s largely ignored by the market due to its small size and international base, but that under the radar status may offer a genuine margin of safety. The company doesn’t need explosive growth to create value... just continued operational discipline and moderate earnings expansion could justify a higher multiple. It’s a simple, cash-generative staples business trading at a fair price with asymmetric upside if performance remains consistent. What are this sub's thoughts? Happy to expound my argument a bit more with numbers, valuation projections, but wanted to kick things off on a qualitative manner first.",7,1,2025-10-20 21:14:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1obu1a7/hidden_compounders_g_willifood_wilc_fairly_valued/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.092283,0.4,$T,0.6,['WILC'],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps']",0.7342857142857142,Communication Services
T,1o1rlmr,ValueInvesting,PayPal DD lots of potential,"PayPal is a mature company that’s been trying to reinvent itself over the past two years. Most people still see it as just a checkout button, but what’s really happening inside the business is a slow rebuild around higher-margin opportunities. Right now PayPal processes roughly $1.7 trillion in total payment volume per year. About a quarter of that comes from cross-border transactions, and that part of the business alone generates around $12 to $13 billion in revenue with about $3.5 billion in profit. It’s by far their most profitable segment, but the U.S. domestic side is still their foundation, bringing in more than half of all revenue. Domestically PayPal’s share has slipped a bit as Apple Pay and Shopify Payments expand, yet their branded checkout volume is still growing in the mid-single digits and their newer checkout platform has already captured about 60 percent of U.S. transactions. If that trend continues and they stabilize their U.S. share, PayPal could see domestic transaction profit rise from around $3 billion today to closer to $4 billion by 2027. That would keep the U.S. market steady enough for new areas like advertising, merchant services, and PayPal World to drive the real growth. The advertising business could quietly become one of their biggest profit engines. They plan to use the data from hundreds of billions of transactions each year to create a retail media platform that connects merchants with shoppers. Because PayPal already knows what people buy and where, they can offer advertisers precise targeting without relying on third-party cookies or outside data. Even if this business only captures one percent of the total digital ad market, that would mean roughly $2 to $3 billion a year in high-margin revenue by 2028. At a 30 percent operating margin, that’s nearly a billion dollars in new profit, which is massive for a company whose core payments margins are tighter. Their new merchant platform, PayPal Open, could also meaningfully expand profit per customer. Instead of just charging processing fees, PayPal will provide risk tools, analytics, and integrated business finance. If even 10 percent of their current merchants adopt these value-added services and spend an extra $100 per month on them, that’s roughly $1.2 billion in recurring annual revenue with higher margins than payment volume. Layer that with gradual growth in debit card usage and Pay Later financing, and PayPal could realistically add another $2 to $3 billion in net income from these extensions within the next five years. The long-term wildcard is PayPal World. The CEO believes it could connect over two billion new wallet users across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. If that happens, cross-border payment volume could climb from $400 billion today to as much as $1.2 trillion by 2030. Even with some fee compression to about 2.5 percent, that would push revenue from roughly $12 billion today to over $30 billion, with profits potentially doubling to $7 or $8 billion annually. That kind of expansion could lift PayPal’s total earnings from around $6 billion today to roughly $11–12 billion within the decade, depending on execution and global adoption. Assuming they maintain capital discipline and keep buybacks running at current levels, earnings per share could move from about $4.70 today to somewhere between $9 and $11 by 2030. Using a conservative multiple of 16 times earnings puts the stock around $150, while a bullish case assuming successful adoption of PayPal World and growth from ads could push fair value closer to $200–220 per share. In short PayPal isn’t a hyper-growth tech name anymore, but it’s quietly repositioning itself to capture high-margin opportunities in advertising, merchant tools, and global interoperability.

T,1omcuxl,ValueInvesting,"OKEA.OL: 0.1× EBITDA, 30 % yield potential, and clear M&A angle","**OKEA ASA** (OSE: OKEA) might be one of the most overlooked E&Ps on Oslo Børs right now. Despite holding **76 million boe of 2P reserves**, a **net-cash balance sheet**, and multiple operated hubs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the company trades at just **0.1× 2027E EBITDA** and around **USD 0.84 per boe** – levels normally reserved for distressed assets. The disconnect is simple: * Dividend payments were **temporarily suspended in 2024** to fund two major projects – the **Bestla tie-back to Brage** and **Draugen electrification**. * High capex in 2025–26 (USD 330–365 m p.a.) obscures what happens when those projects finish. * With limited analyst coverage and a tight float (46 % held by BCPR), most institutional investors aren’t paying attention. Using NHG modelling based on current company guidance through 2026, we estimate the following shifts in 2027: * **Production rises \~30 %** as Bestla comes onstream. * **Capex falls \~60 %**, from USD 330 m to \~USD 130 m. * Opex per boe declines as volumes rise. At **USD 70 Brent**, modeled 2027 free cash flow hits roughly **USD 220 million** – equivalent to **120 % FCF yield** on today’s market cap (\~USD 187 million). Even under current bond covenants, OKEA could distribute **20–30 % dividend yield** once net-cash status allows. With refinancing, that capacity could double. It’s a classic *time-arbitrage* situation: the market is pricing the high-capex years but ignoring the post-2027 cash machine. There’s also a strategic layer – OKEA’s operated hubs overlap neatly with DNO’s growing Norwegian portfolio after the Sval Energi acquisition – but that’s a story of its own. 👇 **Full analysis (including the DNO takeover angle)** here: [https://norwaystocks.substack.com/p/okea-deep-value-dividend-return-and](https://norwaystocks.substack.com/p/okea-deep-value-dividend-return-and)",5,2,2025-11-02 09:19:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1omcuxl/okeaol_01_ebitda_30_yield_potential_and_clear_ma/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.871414,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'volume', 'market cap', 'acquisition']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1ojzy8v,ValueInvesting,RateCycle Strategy,"I think we’re heading into a major crypto bear market — and the main reason might surprise some people: interest rate cuts. Since COVID, both Bitcoin and gold have been rising as safe-haven assets. Investors saw them as protection against inflation, uncertainty, and global instability. But once interest rates fall back toward zero, the game changes. Big money can borrow cheaply again — and when that happens, capital usually flows back into equities, not crypto. If the stock market starts performing well again, there’s less incentive to hold Bitcoin as a “hedge.” Its safe-haven narrative weakens, and we could see some cooling off in the crypto space. Now — here’s where my strategy kicks in. When the economy dips and rate cuts approach zero, I plan to buy growth stocks — especially: • 🌱 Green energy stocks (clean tech, renewables) • 💻 Tech growth stocks (the usual innovators) • 🤖 AI-focused stocks (the next wave of productivity) These sectors usually benefit the most from low borrowing costs and renewed risk appetite. When money gets cheap, growth stocks fly. Then, once those positions start generating solid profits, I’ll rotate a chunk of those gains into Bitcoin — ideally when crypto sentiment is still low and accumulation phases begin. Over time, repeating this cycle — moving from growth stocks to Bitcoin when momentum shifts — could compound gains massively. • Stocks do well early in the recovery (post-rate cuts). • Bitcoin tends to explode later, once liquidity really floods the system. So the idea isn’t to panic or change strategy — it’s to stay ready. Markets move in cycles, and if you can ride both sides of that cycle (equities first, crypto later), you don’t just survive — you thrive. ⸻ TL;DR: • Rate cuts → stock market comeback → crypto cools off. • Buy growth stocks when the economy dips and rates are near zero. • Take profits from stocks → rotate into Bitcoin before the next bull run. • Repeat over time = potential compounding beast.",0,25,2025-10-30 13:38:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ojzy8v/ratecycle_strategy/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.891190,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear', 'dip', 'profit']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services

(LBW – Warsaw Stock Exchange) is a Polish company that designs and manufactures protective gear, military equipment, and technical textiles, supplying both defense forces and civilian markets. It has posted very strong results for the first half of 2025. Revenues grew 52 percent to PLN 312 million and net income jumped 90 percent to PLN 57 million.

T,1o3p120,stocks,Why SEALSQ might age better than Rigetti,"$LAES → SEALSQ’s multiple sits at the lower fringe of the speculative continuum: anchored in practical domains like quantum security & IoT hardware, rather than floating in the zero-gravity of science-fiction valuation narratives. It’s a speculative play, yes, but one that still remembers to manufacture actual silicone. By contrast, Rigetti’s reported revenue multiples hover between \~1,500× & 1,800× a monument to the market’s enduring absurdity. It’s an irony of market psychology: the company producing semiconductors trades at a fraction of the valuation of one still prototyping superconducting circuits in a lab. That dynamic may invert soon, as capital begins to migrate toward companies offering deployable, quantum-secure technology instead of distant, theoretical compute power & a Wix website. SEALSQ exhibits the full suite of credibility: a glossy website, a name calibrated for seriousness & a Swiss headquarters that project discretion, precision, & branding as proof of concept. The company’s narrative leans on the vocabulary of inevitability: “semiconductor” “quantum-resistant,” “trusted,” “sovereign,” & “national security.” SEALSQ reported a 41% YoY revenue increase through Q3 2025 & reaffirmed its full-year revenue forecast, projecting a 59% to 82% increase over 2024. The growth, predictably, came from “strong demand” for its core products & the acquisition of IC’ALPS. The momentum is set to culminate at the Quantum + AI Conference in New York later this month & carry through 2026, sustained by quantum-safe security systems aligned with U.S. government standards & a rotation of partnerships & acquisitions. When the hype cycle finally fades, SEALSQ’s realism might look less elevated. Rigetti’s website is an aesthetic tragedy that looks as if it were cobbled together on Wix by a particularly optimistic intern unable to achieve basic design coherence. Quantum computing demands a level of obsessive attention to detail: fractions of a Kelvin, picosecond timing, noise isolation at the edge of physics. When the front end looks half-finished, it’s hard not to question whether that discipline extends behind the lab door. Something doesn’t add up. Have you seen SEALSQ’s website? If corporate websites are any proxy for DNA, SEALSQ looks like it’s building things that actually work. Expect a fresh wave of press releases & conveniently timed analyst upgrades in the near term. The Quantum + AI Conference: alternately marketed as Quantum + AI 2.0 or IQT Quantum + AI, depending on who’s paying for the banner, will occur October 19–21, 2025, in New York City. The agenda promises deep inquiry into the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, & cryptographic security.

T,1o5l8u1,investing,Why I’m Not Buying $KTOS Even Though I Love the Tech,"I’ve been following Kratos Defense ($KTOS) for years, and few companies in defense tech excite me as much. They’re at the cutting edge of unmanned systems, hypersonic testing, and satellite communications. The stuff military R&D budgets dream about. But despite the tech, I’m staying on the sidelines for now. Kratos has transformed from a niche contractor into a next-gen defense innovator. They build reusable jet-powered drones (like the Valkyrie), hypersonic test vehicles, and satellite ground systems used by the U.S. military and allies. Revenue is ramping fast (up 13% y/y in the first half of 2025), backed by a record $1.4 billion backlog. The Unmanned Systems division alone grew nearly 30% last year. They’re in the right place at the right time, with defense budgets expanding globally and new programs in drone warfare and missile defense gaining traction. So what’s the problem? Profitability. Last quarter’s operating margin was roughly 1%. That’s not a typo. Legacy players like $LMT or $RTX earn ten to fifteen times that. Kratos is stuck with cost overruns on fixed-price contracts and inflation-bitten components it can’t reprice until new production lots kick in. Management is trying to fix it by renegotiating contracts, producing ahead of awards, and building its own jet engine plant to reduce supplier dependence but those fixes take time. For now, every extra dollar of revenue barely drops to the bottom line. Then comes valuation. The stock trades like a software company, not a defense contractor: more than 200× forward earnings and 140× forward EV/EBITDA. Even drone peer $AVAV looks cheap beside it. The stock has tripled in a year, so the market’s already priced in flawless execution. When a defense stock trades like a startup, you need either sustained margin expansion or a reset in expectations ... and I don’t see either yet. Valkyrie just became a DoD Program of Record (translation: procurement dollars are coming). The hypersonic test and space-comms businesses have multi-year growth potential. Kratos’ $13 billion opportunity pipeline is proof of credibility with the Pentagon and primes. If they can scale production efficiently and push EBITDA margins into the mid-teens, the stock could grow into its valuation. But as of today, the math doesn’t work. Great story, high execution risk, stretched multiple. For me, Kratos fits the “great company, risky entry” box. I’d rather wait for a pullback or hard evidence that margins are improving.",0,8,2025-10-13 14:28:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o5l8u1/why_im_not_buying_ktos_even_though_i_love_the_tech/,2025-11-07 16:43:31.495357,0.4,$T,0.8,"['KTOS', 'AVAV', 'LMT', 'RTX']","['earnings', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7171428571428571,Communication Services

In Korea, more and more people(10\~50 age) are shifting from reading physical books to reading e-books on tablets. This trend is accelerating fast. The subscription-based reading platform market in Korea still has less than 10% penetration which means it’s in the very early stages. As digital content consumption grows and leading players like Millie’s Library continue to expand the market, the overall industry potential is enormous Currently, the company offers e-books, audiobooks, audio dramas, and chatbooks, with more content types in development. Through its B2B business, it partners with various corporations, mid-sized companies, and educational institutions to generate stable revenue Since KT is one of Korea’s top three telecom companies, it creates strong ecosystem linkages onnecting existing and new customers to Millie’s Library through bundled offers and marketing partnerships, ensuring steady recurring revenue Another key area of focus is its creative platform, “Millie Road,” which secures original intellectual properties (IP) and expands them into web novels and film adaptations building a high-margin IP studio model Thanks to this strong moat, revenue, operating profit, and net income have been steadily increasing every year Cash reserves are rising, debt is falling, and the company’s financial statements show remarkable strength There’s a saying in Korea: “Even if people can’t afford much, they’ll still buy a phone.” Since everyone owns a phone, the potential for this mobile-based business to scale multiple times larger is clear And with its small market cap, just a bit of capital inflow could easily trigger a multi-bagger run potentially even a 40-bagger Thank you for reading the detailed report.",8,14,2025-11-04 11:37:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oo551y/an_undervalued_korean_monopoly_reading_platform/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.852667,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['market cap', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7171428571428571,Communication Services

T,1opu9x3,stocks,LETS TALK LONGSHOTS (DUOL(ingo) and TO(a)ST).,"Two Go Big or Go Home companies that will make me or lose me a significant amount of money. 1. DUOL: It’s a famous language learning app, that is now expanding into other subjects (math, music and especially chess) which I think will help user retention and the total addressable market. The company has a competitive advantage over others, since it has a history of implementing new features and sees what works and makes the app addictive. I believe the company also has lots of operating leverage, since it can keep expanding its offerings and integrating AI, thus growing its userbase without excessive costs. The company currently trades at an adjusted free cash flow yield of 1.7%, with a revenue growth rate of over 40%, which is around the same as its daily active users (39%), and paid subscribers (36%). I therefore believe the conversion rate is very healthy, and the company can grow, monetize and has some pricing power. Monthly active users are growing more slowly, but still at a healthy 20%. Yesterday’s earnings were positive on all metrics, and exactly what I expected from the company. I think a comparison would be Netflix. Netflix has a more established business model, a similar adjusted free cash flow yield (1.6% against 1.7%) but its growing revenue more slowly, at 15% x year, so I see more potential with duol. 2.TOST. Toast is a company that sells software to restaurants and other businesses. I believe restoration is a growing industry, although very competitive, and people will increase eating out in the future, thanks to long term trends (overworked people, growing urbanization, growth of delivery services…). Being the software and hardware provider is a great position to be in. I think they will have lots of data and feedback on their restaurants, and they will provide a valuable service that once they become embedded into the operations will be very hard to move away from. Thus, although restaurants margins aren’t great, I believe the company will have pricing power. Right now, the company trades at a 1.2% free cash flow yield, however the price to sales is only 4 and the forward PE is 38. I strongly believe the company may expand its margins in the future, being a subscription business with recurring revenues, thus making it undervalued int the long term. The growth is a healthy 25%, and by selling their hardware at a discount I believe they can sustain their growth in the future and expand outside of the US. Both companies have very strong balance sheets, with a ever growing cash pile and zero debt.",10,26,2025-11-06 09:17:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1opu9x3/lets_talk_longshots_duolingo_and_toast/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.790851,0.4,$T,0.9,[],"['earnings', 'revenue']",0.7114285714285714,Communication Services
T,1o8v6mm,investing,Consistently Profitable Traders - Is a 3-5% Monthly Return Realistic with a $100k+ Prop Account?,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for real-world insights from those with years of experience, especially those who have maintained profitability and consistency, not just enjoyed a few good months. I’ve been in the market since 2020, focusing mainly on long-term crypto holds and swing trading. Recently, I’ve shifted my attention entirely to prop firm trading. I spent three months on a demo account with decent results trading XAU/USD (Gold) and EUR/USD. I know that demo results mean nothing when real money is at stake, so I’m now focused on testing and improving my strategies. My main question is this: Is a consistent 3-5% monthly return (36-60% annually) a realistic target for a trader with a well-funded account ($100k+)? Assuming you have strong risk management and a proven advantage, is this target too ambitious? I’d love to know what your realistic and consistent monthly or annual percentage target is, and what maximum daily or weekly drawdown you typically allow to achieve it. I’ve been working on a trading bot. It was initially designed for crypto and performs well in backtests for BTC, ETH, and SOL. Now, I’m putting in a lot of effort to adapt it for Gold, high-liquidity Forex pairs, and major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The challenge is that my four-year backtests for Forex and Metals aren’t showing the same consistent success I see in crypto. For instance, my current XAU/USD strategy has only a 34% win rate, and I’m trying hard to raise that to at least 55-60%. The optimization process is frustrating. I’ve either overloaded the bot with too many indicators, making it stop finding trades, or it’s too loose and generates many false signals. I’m looking for that perfect balance. I’m also integrating modules to track fundamental news, the FOMC calendar, and the DXY direction as key inputs for trade direction confirmation, aiming for a more complete approach. I’ve heard that a Grid Scalp strategy (multiple open positions spaced by a few pips) can work well on Gold, but my bot’s test results aren’t optimized yet. Do any consistently profitable traders here use a Grid Scalp strategy for XAU/USD? If so, any advice or important warnings would be greatly appreciated. What main strategies (scalping, mean reversion, trend following, etc.) do you use for Metals, Forex, and Indices? And importantly, what is your typical lot size when managing a $100k+ account while keeping strict risk limits (e.g., 0.5% or 1% risk per trade)? Finally, I’ve narrowed my choices down to GoatFundedTrader, FTMO, and FundedNext while researching spreads, fees, and rules. Any insights, reviews, or warnings about these or other top firms would be incredibly helpful. Any advice or constructive feedback is welcome.

T,1oe4gnc,ValueInvesting,My Grandma’s 3 Rules for Investing Still Work 40 Years Later,"Back in the 1980s, my grandma started investing not because she was into finance, but because she hated the idea of “money sitting idle.” She didn’t have a degree, didn’t read The Wall Street Journal, and never once said “diversify your portfolio.” She just bought what she *understood.* Her first picks were Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson brands she used every single day. While everyone else chased “the next big thing,” she just quietly reinvested her dividends and forgot about the noise. I once asked her how she stayed calm through crashes the 1987 crash, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and even the COVID dip. She smiled and said: “I buy what I believe in, I ignore what I don’t understand, and I let time do the heavy lifting.” >Today, she’s in her 80s, and the dividends from those same “boring” stocks pay more than most people’s full-time jobs.

T,1ockh3m,ValueInvesting,Value Companies Perceived as Value Traps,"A few great businesses today, were seen as failures, or “value traps” at one point. I believe it is valuable to reflect on these, to help identify value today. Microsoft (early 2010s) Seen as a slow moving tech giant. Missed out on phones completely. People were comparing it to Apple at the time and it seemed to be lacking in innovation in comparison. Compared to Amazon, it was late to cloud computing. It traded at a low P/E for years. It was seen as an ex-growth company. Buying it was like buying Coca-Cola or something. I see comparisons between how this company is viewed and how some people are viewing Amazon and Nvidia “How Big Can It Get?? The whole stock market is worth _____, it could never hit a ______ market cap!” Even when Amazon and Nvidia still have a lot of growth to go. But, Apple is probably the most “stagnant” company that can be compared to how Microsoft was being viewed. Apple is being viewed in a similar way for being behind on AI, but Apple will prevail! Is Apple value? On paper, probably not, though. Apple (1990s/early 2000s) Products were failing, their computers were irrelevant, and their OS business model wasn’t understood. It was seen as a dying company. What company does this remind me of, perhaps Intel, or PayPal? Is it game over for these companies? Maybe, but they’re making some moves that may pay off and they could have a turn around story like these other “value traps”. American Express (1960s) Was defrauded by a vegetable oil company. People panicked. Someone in particular bought. This was a big deal. This is like if a rocket explodes / fails for RKLB, or if a Taiwan invasion happens for many Chinese stocks such as JD, or BABA. These are big events - but if the company is truly quality, when an event send its stock price far below fair value, this is a great time to feast on some good prices. Now, the question is. Since you won’t buy Chinese stocks because of the Taiwan invasion possibility, will you buy Chinese stocks after an invasions happens? Will you buy RKLB if their rockets fail and send the stock price soaring down? Will you buy PayPal if they grow their ads platform? Will you buy intel if their chips pickup steam and their foundry is, as predicted, the second largest foundry by around 2030? See, that would make it value now, but that’s many years away, you could probably purchase in 2028 for just as good of a deal… or could you?",3,8,2025-10-21 18:15:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ockh3m/value_companies_perceived_as_value_traps/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.085676,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['rocket', 'market cap']",0.7114285714285714,Communication Services

T,1ojbn0n,stocks,Why do passive ETF investors act like active  investors don’t know what they’re doing?,"I see the movement from mutual funds into indexation as a result of fund managers who didn't earn their fees. It's not that indexation is better - it's just cheaper. Sometimes it performs better, sure, but the main appeal is cost. Now for the irony... Why do stocks in the index have the weightings they do? Where did those weightings come from? They don't fall from the sky, obey the laws of physics or nature. Stock X (not the shoe reseller app) has a market cap of $80 billion, while Stock Y sits at $180 billion. Why? Partly because of what the companies achieve - but mostly because investors decided that's what they're worth. So who determines those market weightings - the prices, and therefore the composition of the index? Active investors. And yet, the whole trend towards passive investing is built on the premise that active investors are idiots and don't know what they're doing. The irony is that the passive investor's entire MO is to emulate the decisions of those same ""idiots"" So, to the ETF crowd: how do you feel about parking your money in a fund where nobody is thinking about which stocks should be included, what they're worth, or how they're weighted?",0,64,2025-10-29 17:57:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ojbn0n/why_do_passive_etf_investors_act_like_active/,2025-11-07 16:43:08.811372,0.4,$T,0.9,[],['market cap'],0.7057142857142856,Communication Services

T,1o6dg71,investing,Why I’m starting to question the whole “invest early” advice,"So I’ve been investing since January, mostly ETFs and some crypto. My portfolio’s around €5.5k right now, up about 9% this year (roughly €400–€500 profit). And I also run a small reselling business. I buy stuff and flip it for profit. After doing some quick math, I noticed something pretty crazy: If I put €500 into my business, I usually make like 2.5x that back within 2 months. If I put that same €500 into the stock market, I’d maybe get 13% in a good year. That’s a huge difference. So it got me thinking, why does everyone say “start investing as early as possible” and “the stock market will make you rich”? If I had just reinvested everything into my business, I’d probably be sitting on like €15k by now. Honestly, I think investing makes way more sense later like when I’m in uni and can’t focus on my business as much, or when I’ve got a stable job (I want to become a pilot eventually) and can invest a few thousand a month long-term. Right now, while I can actively grow my money way faster through business, putting it in the market just feels kinda pointless.

It feels like the biggest technological innovation since the Internet is making this company rally and three years ago I told myself nah it can’t keep going up. Well it pretty much goes up like 5 % every week, lol. And AI is still in its early stages if you look at the world. So if it’s as big as the Internet then why wouldn’t NVDA continue to rally pretty much every day for the next many years? So why don’t I buy NVDA stocks? Well, let me use an analogy- say you want to buy a new iPhone. Six months ago it would cost you $499. Three months ago you’d be paying $699. Last week you’d pay $749. Today, you’ll pay $849. Dumb comparison, I know. Anyway- the risk of a crash in the stock price isn’t actually what’s keeping me from buying it. Rather, it’s because of an irrational belief that I I’m paying too high a price because I could’ve bought it way cheaper very recently. And it’s stupid I know that- because it’s a perfectly fair price if the stock continues to go up as it very likely will, maybe not actually every day but a year or five years from now it seems dead certain it will be worth more than it is today. Nothing is certain I know that and it could in fact crash but like I said that’s not really why I hesitate to buy it. Sorry for the not so special thoughts and ideas.

T,1ob4ilg,ValueInvesting,Value investing is a brain dead term,"Every investor wants to generate value for themselves and is looking to buy a company at a good valuation compared to its long term prospect. Disconnecting value from growth might be one of the most stupid concepts ever. Growth is literally the one and only thing that drives up company value and therefore stock price. So what is ”value investing” even supposed to mean? When I judge it by the posts in this sub, it’s basically about buying long term established companies with an historically low P/E and thinking that they found an ”undervalued” company. Well guess what, most of the time this company has peaked and is starting to slowly die or at least the growth is slowing down, so the market isn’t willing to put the same historical premium on its cashflows. People turn to ”value investing”, because it gives them a sense of security. But nobody is not value investing.

If I can’t afford a house because it costs 3 million dollars and I earn 3000 dollars, the best solution is to ignore paper money and the dollar. High home prices and low salaries wouldn’t exist if people ignored the price in paper money and found another value of exchange. And that is gold. Gold that cannot be multiplied or controlled. I buy a bag of gold coins and don’t care about banks. The gold price is rising and will keep rising. Contrary, Bitcoin is becoming a meme. It was supposed to be digital gold, but it’s laughable. No asset that is in the hands of rich people who can manipulate prices through insider trading is safe. So what will happen next? Gold rush a run to traditional physical assets, a run away from stocks and digital assets, Bitcoin, and crypto scams. A run away from the dollar. The dollar will devalue, and no one will respect that paper money. What is happening in the world right now is a boiling pot that is about to explode. That’s because of a sick situation people realizing they are slaves, destined to work and have nothing today, not even a secure job, while the rich keep getting richer. * Unemployment is growing. * Enormous unemployment among young college graduates. * Smart, angry people laid off from corporations. * People are angry at this system and buy gold, trash the dollar, because in a world where people with years of experience can’t find a job since they’re replaced and cost-cut, those are bad times, so they secure their savings by buying gold and leaving the dollar system. * Falling birth rates people can’t afford homes because of enormous growing prices. * Corporations paying low taxes. * Worsening access to healthcare expensive healthcare. * Life becoming worse and people getting more angry. So the next bubble, the next big crisis and black swan event, is the gold rush and devaluation from the dollar to physical assets like metals, gold, and diamonds. Paper money becoming useless in a system made only for the rich. People will try to create their own independent payment system, away from the rich elites trade for trade, skill for skill, I help you with that, you help me with this bypassing paper money.

Figured it’s finally time to make a move and get my money working. Planning to hold 5+ years, maybe longer. Quick background: • I run a business in the advertising space, salary around $150K/yr as CEO. • Expecting a $10–15M exit from the biz in the next 2 years. • Not relying on this $500K for living expenses, just want smart long-term growth. • Comfortable with risk, but don’t wanna be glued to charts all day. Context / bias: I’m from the ad side and we spend 8 figures a year on Meta (Facebook/Instagram). I’ve seen how strong their ad platform still is — AI targeting, reels, conversion improvements, etc. So yeah, I’m pretty bullish on Meta long-term. But I’m not sure how much I should actually put into a single stock vs just going broad ETFs. Questions: • Is it a decent time to start investing right now, or better to wait / DCA in over time? • What % would you personally put into one stock (like Meta) if you have high conviction? • What ETFs / allocation would make sense here (S&P 500, total market, international, bonds, etc)? • Would you go lump sum or DCA since I’m planning to hold long-term anyway?

T,1o2e9aw,ValueInvesting,Talk me out of investing in $HAIN,"Edit #2: I’ve been thoroughly dissuaded. The stock is down over 80% in the last year and over 90% in the last 5 years. Their current market cap is $126 million at a share price of $1.40. What has caught my attention is the number of prominent consumer brands this group owns, despite their apparent sales struggles in the last few years. Celestial seasoning teas, Alba Botanica, Garden Veggie Snacks, Avalon Organic, Imagine Foods, Jason natural products, Maranatha, Terra Chips, and the Greek Gods. These are the ones I recognize from everyday grocery shopping and I have bought from every single one of these brands over the years. I sometimes still buy Alba sunscreen and Maranatha almond butter at Costco. It seems to me that the level of consumer recognition and the size of their established distribution channels would already be worth more than the current market cap. They clearly need to turn it around, but it seems like this would be fairly easy by just renewing some brands and getting some new more competitive products out? I realize none of this goes into financial details etc, but this market cap does just seem strikingly low, so just running on vibes I thought I’d try to get some discussion going on this.

T,1ofglno,investing,Are tax lien/tax deeds a good investment?,"I have been thinking of this type of investment for a while now. The plan is to start with cheap tax liens and eventually get tax deeds to acquire properties and wholesale them or fix and flip. For more context, I paid $400 for a 3 day workshop, currently got done the first day. It sounds too good to be true because I don’t know what are the tax implications and they don’t talk about that “because of legal reasons” - they are not CPAs. I am curious what other people think about it and if anyone is doing this. Edit: what the are saying is when you buy tax deeds the families are not on the house anymore and that they already lost their house to the county and that the county foreclosed the property. We were 65 people in the room today and most of half were worried about leaving other people without a house. They did mention about the types they of bidding and that sometimes you won’t win.

T,1oq17oi,ValueInvesting,Hnst small cap value play,"Not trying to pump anything here, just laying out what I’m seeing on Honest Company (HNST). It’s a small cap consumer brand (diapers, wipes, personal care, etc.). The stock has already moved off its lows, so this isn’t “undiscovered,” but I wanted to break down whether the move is sustainable or not. Financials Market Cap: ~$200M–$260M range depending on the day. Revenue: ~$320M yearly run-rate, basically flat YoY. Profitability: Still not profitable. Net losses have been narrowing, but they’re not making money yet. Gross Margin: ~35% and improving. This is actually the key number worth watching because it signals pricing power + lower input costs. Cash: Has enough liquidity to avoid immediate dilution, but they are not cash-flow positive yet, so dilution is always a risk in small caps like this. Debt: Low relative to revenue; balance sheet isn’t stressed. Summary of financial direction: They’re moving toward being a break-even consumer staples brand. It’s slow. If margins continue trending up, the story is that they eventually turn profitable without blowing up the balance sheet. If cost inflation returns or they lose distribution, that story breaks. Catalysts Distribution expansion (Target, Costco, Whole Foods etc.) is already in place, so the bull argument is mostly efficiency + margin improvement, not growth. Any quarter where they print positive EBITDA will get attention because funds that screen for profitable only could start entering. Technicals Float is small, which means moves are amplified. Stock has been in a long bottoming pattern for months. 200-day moving average has turned upward—this is usually the first sign of institutional accumulation rather than retail noise. Volume spikes recently look like controlled buying rather than FOMO candles. There’s a clear support zone around the $3.40–$3.80 area. If it loses that with volume, the bull setup is invalid. Upside levels to watch: Next realistic target if trend continues: $5.20–$5.60 range. Beyond that only if they actually print profitability, or if small cap sentiment rotates positive. Risks Still unprofitable. They have to keep increasing margin. Consumer brands tend to trade sideways for long periods. If small caps rotate out or the market risk-off returns, HNST is one of the first that gets sold.

T,1op7paz,ValueInvesting,Private Trader - The Equation of Defense,"Let’s dive right in! In my previous posts, I mentioned how the time to be on the defensive, and I mean ultra-defensive, is now! The market isn’t going to wait for one to make moves after-the-fact, and that fact is drawing ever-so-near; the end of the data-blackout period and the clarity that follows. This morning, I initiated multiple moves within my portfolio. Trimmed a portion of a strongly defensive equity to free up more cash flow, then used that liquidity to start another defensive position elsewhere. I also repositioned myself within U.S. Treasuries, and will continue to do so as the days, weeks progress At the moment, I still hold roughly +15 % of my entire portfolio in a pure cash state; AKA further ammunition waiting for the right triggers, for my equations to beep the time has arrived, and its literally in week(s) if not day(s). **The “Validity” Period** The equations I use have gone through endless rebirths; built, broken, re-engineered, and broken again and again and again, many times over. They evolve because the market itself is alive, dynamic; it breathes, morphs, deceives and many-more-adjectives-in-between. If your strategy doesn’t move with that pulse, then you've effectively surrendered yourself to it. And surrender not! Every equation has what I call a ""validity"" period; think of it like a brief window where the alignment between structure and reality actually holds and once that fades, the entire construct decays, and so does whatever equation, whatever ""eureka"" or else you might have; in simple words, your ""edge"". The more in-tune you are with that cycle, the better you capture what matters most: profit. I use ChatGPT for many things, I consider it a sidekick-of-sorts; it makes many mistakes that anger-me-daily! Its a tool among tools, and many of these tools are purely static-in-form; the market is not. Your equations must adapt; their validity shifts and you must not treat the market as a constant; it is not. Never was, never will be. Your mission is to stay dynamic, to see when the rhythm changes and pivot; once you adopt that mentality, you stop chasing perfection and start synchronizing with volatility itself. **The “Reset” Period** My prime directive since day-1, in 2020, is capital preservation. Always has been, always will be. My goal isn’t to win every trade, even though thats what we all want to achieve, but more importantly so, is to ensure that no matter what storm hits, the portfolio survives to fight another day. One of my key frameworks is the reset of risk where constantly realize capital, not because I fear the market, but because I respect the cycles it goes through. When I bank profit, be it 2%, 5 %, or whatever it might be, I've effectively sterilized that capital, and this in turn allows me to redeploy it into another depending on the equations I work with. This constant recalibration reduces a great deal of emotional weight, it’s not about chasing every move; it’s about staying alive long enough to strike when conviction meets alignment. Simple in theory; brutal in execution. I failed many times over to get this through my brain. **The “Control” Period** Every single trader on earth has a small zone of control, their own true variable; some have more than others, but essentially its a slice of the equation that belongs entirely to you and one that you actually have control over; the rest belongs to noise, data, liquidity, etc. Mastering that small variable is everything; it's what truly constitutes your ""edge"", and ego is your kryptonite! Overconfidence further blinds you, and if your able to detach enough to autopsy both your wins and your failures, you start learning from both. Every time you do, be it win or less, further compounds your instinct! Control here doesn’t mean dominance; rather it means awareness! And that awareness becomes your rhythm, a variable that never grows because of arrogance; it grows through humility, repetition, and brutal honesty to ones self. **The “Shock” Period** Repetition can dull the mind and make you numb as you constantly repeat trades, over and over, it breeds complacency; this is why I inject controlled chaos into my system in order to ""awaken"" the senses if you will. In essence, I take a small, low-risk position in something untested, like a live experiment but not a gamble, not a YOLO; here it’s not really about chasing returns-per-say, but it’s about keeping the blade sharp where capital at risk changes how you think as it compresses your focus and exposes your instinct, your edge; think of it like ""shock positions” that tune-up the brain. Every single win, loss, or else adds further dimensions to the entire process your undertaking. **The “Defensive” Period** Today’s portfolio shifts reflects everything above; I trimmed one position at breakeven to free liquidity, initiated a new highly defensive equity right after its earnings came out, and re-entered a previously sold name after its price faded taking it back within my ""zone-of-comfort"". Each of these have dual purposes; yield and resilience. A dividend that protects the unknown, and the potential for capital appreciation which further compounds. We’re entering the phase where the illusion-of-today could break down any minute; where the fake pieces of this overall puzzle start to drop and the reality of the image emerges in its raw and unsanitized form. Defensive positioning isn’t hesitation, it's foresight, it’s the architecture that keeps you standing. Time will tell how this next sequence plays out, we're not too far out from it. Stay sharp, stay adaptive, stay alive; Peace out and till the next one!",1,0,2025-11-05 16:35:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1op7paz/private_trader_the_equation_of_defense/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.847396,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'yolo', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss', 'eps']",0.64,Communication Services
T,1o1fodv,ValueInvesting,Thoughts on APA Corp (APA) ?,"I have a stock screener on Schwab I like to periodically look through that focuses on dividend paying companies (criteria consists of the stock price being below $100, an ex-dividend date within the next month, a net profit margin greater than 5%, a stock price decrease/increase of -50% to 25% year to date, and a forward P/E ratio below 20) Today I saw APA Corp pop up on the screen for the first time. At first glance it interested me, but was hoping someone more informed may be able to provide some basics about the company and share their opinions. Google’s overview says APA is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration - … no clue what that means, but I will be looking into it. APA currently trades just below $25.00 and offers a $0.25 quarterly dividend. APA has a PE ratio 8.27 (forward PE of 7.19). This past quarter (June report) shows APA doing $2.19B in revenue and $603M in net income (while having a market cap of $8.8B). Revenue has been up and down over the past 5 years, as has net income, yet they haven’t had a big loss in net income since Q1 of 2020 (where they had net income of -$4.4B, since then their least profitable quarter was only a -$0.22B loss). Revenue has been above $1.5B every quarter since Q4 of 2020 (trending relatively upward). A quick google search showed me that APA has bought back 92 million shares for more than $3.07B (nearly half of their market cap) since 2018. APA also plans to “return 60% of its free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases). APA does have a decent amount of debt, close to $6B, with a debt to equity ratio of 1.5ish. In writing this post I’ve actually found a little more about APA’s business model. They are a producer of crude oil and natural gas (where a 1.5 D/E ratio is relatively common) … much less exciting than I was hoping though. Still going to post this, as I’ve already typed out a good bit. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, but I am not as excited about APA as I was when I started the post. Also please comment with other undervalued dividend paying companies I could look into.",0,3,2025-10-08 16:41:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o1fodv/thoughts_on_apa_corp_apa/,2025-11-07 16:44:26.247438,0.4,T stock,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'loss', 'pe ratio']",0.6342857142857142,Communication Services

T,1oaqzdg,ValueInvesting,Inside ARM: How the World’s Chip Architect Keeps Its Edge (and Why Investors Should Care),"Arm Holdings is a **British semiconductor and software design company that** (unlike many other semiconductor companies) **creates the architectures and blueprints for most of the world's mobile and embedded processors.** Instead of manufacturing chips, ARM licenses its Intellectual Property (IP) to companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Nvidia, which integrate them into their own products. Their **low-power and high-efficiency designs** dominate smartphones, tablets and IoT, devices, and are rapidly expanding into data centers, automotive systems and AI accelerators. Because ARM earns royalties from every chip built using its technology, **it benefits from the global growth of computing without the capital intensity of chip fabrication**. This is reason why ratios for this company cannot be compared with companies from chip making industry, simply said, ARM is selling licenses and collecting royalties on their design so their growth margin will always be bigger when compared to other industries. (this is very significant in later stages of this post) # How ARM is making money? There are two interconnected revenue streams: licensing and royalties. The **licensing segment** of business brings in upfront payments from companies that want to use ARM's IP. For example, a chipmaker like Qualcomm or MediaTek pays ARM for the right to use its Cortex or Neoverse cores, or to design their own chips based on the ARM instruction set (Best example is Apple with their M chips). **Royalty business** is where real long-term compounding happens. Once a costumer starts mass-production chips that use ARM's designs, ARM earns a small royalty for every chip shipped. This royalty is never bigger than 1-2% and usually is in range of few cents, but, ARM based chips are sold across smartphones, IoT devices, and increasingly data centers and vehicles. This is high-margin, recurring revenue that scales together with global semiconductor production. **Licensing part of business tends to be shaky part** of business. Reason behind it is that each license is one-time event and ARM never can be 100% sure when next large upfront fee will be paid by some chipmaker. **Also semiconductor industry is highly cyclical**, when new process node (like 3nm) or new product cycle begins industry invest heavily in new chip desings. But, this part of business is very important because licensing builds the pipeline, while royalties monetize that pipeline for years and decades (some of designs made in 1990's still make revenue for ARM). When looking QoQ we can see increase on both Total Revenue (12.1%) and Royalty Revenue(25.3%). In the same time, revenue from licensing made around -1%. Company **CEO Rene Haas is estimating** that ARM will continue revenue **growth somewhere between 20%-30%** which is somehow positive outlook when we take in consideration that in last TTM total revenue increased around 17%. ARM's extraordinary gross margin (97%) is product of their business model. To say it simple as possible the cost to ""produce"" one more ARM license or to collect one more royalty is close to zero, while the revenue can be in the millions. However, the trade is that ARM's operating expanses are very high, especially R&D and personnel costs (their product is human intelligence). # For ARM Research and Development is not optional Practically more than 50% of revenue goes toward development of new CPU architectures, designing new CPU & GPU cores. **It is easy to say that for ARM R&D is not optional it is their business.** It fuels future royalty streams by ensuring they are always ahead of competition. Cutting R&D spending at Arm would be a direct path to stagnation. Within a few years, competitors would start catching up, leading to fewer licensing deals - and naturally, shrinking royalty streams that follow. It’s the same pattern we saw with Nokia: once the leader in mobile phones, slowed its innovation, and eventually became a shell of its former self, surviving today mostly on patent and licensing revenue. # Competition and RISC-V As of writing this text Arm is holding big advantage with its technology. **They work together with Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Nvidia** and others on broad range of products. In last few years most important cooperation is on AI technology where ARM is one of the biggest players. With that in mind according to the last quarter transcript ARM is expecting to shift their market share of ARM neoverse-based chips to top hyperscalers to nearly 50% in this year. **ARM's main competitor is RISC-V**, an open source instruction set architecture developed by global community of contributors who improve and use the sam ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) model. Major players such as Google, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, SiFive, Alibaba, and Western Digital are actively involved - many of them still rely on Arm but are experimenting with RISC-V in parallel. Strategically speaking, RISC-V remains a long way from posing a serious threat. Arm continues to **dominate the mobile CPU market with over 99% share**, and it’s hard to imagine that position changing significantly over the next 5-10 years. # Final thoughts Arm’s future is closely tied to **Apple**, one of its largest clients. With Apple’s global dominance in both computers and mobile devices, Arm benefits from a stable and expanding base for its **licensing and royalty business**, making it a potential safe haven within the semiconductor ecosystem. **Strong competitive moat** is likely to produce significant growth in the coming years. However, it’s important to keep an eye on the next few earnings reports - the company’s**P/E ratio, typically between 80 and 100**, reflects a very high valuation. While many investors view Arm as more than just another chip company, such a premium still demands careful monitoring. At the same time, Arm is **actively expanding** into higher-value markets such as **AI, cloud computing, and automotive**. These projects are still early-stage bets, but it’s very good to see the company investing in long-term growth and diversifying beyond its traditional mobile stronghold.",3,0,2025-10-19 14:26:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oaqzdg/inside_arm_how_the_worlds_chip_architect_keeps/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.108298,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'rally', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.6228571428571429,Communication Services

This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity. Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.",0,5,2025-10-14 19:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/,2025-11-07 16:43:10.787381,0.4,$T,0.9,[],"['bull', 'earnings', 'revenue']",0.6171428571428571,Communication Services

T,1o5oyng,ValueInvesting,"District Metals (DMX.V): Capitalizing on Multiple Global Headwinds for AI, EU Energy and Technology Independence, and Sustainable Clean Power","I found this stock after researching a few different areas to grow with some of the more recent trends. Here is a few that I think illustrate the problem: 1. AI in one form or another is here to stay, and while many of the tech stocks have jumped significantly over the past years, up the value chain is something that gets less attention: how to power them. AI is expected to drive an 165% increase in data center power by 2030 (Goldman Sachs \[1\]). 2. The EU is concerned with both digital sovereignty \[2\] and energy independence \[3\]. I won’t go into all of the initiatives and reasons why, but essentially the EU made a mistake in creating overreliance on Russian energy, and also is alarmed at their digital dependence on the US. The Ukraine war has highlighted strategic security gaps on both of these fronts. 1. The average cost of running a datacenter in Sweden is much smaller than other countries, due to favorable electricity prices \[4\]. As such, some figures put the CAGR for the Data Center market in Sweden at 17.57%. 2. Historically, the EU has turned its nose at the dangers of Nuclear power. Much criticism is levied at Angela Merkel, who also saw an increase in reliance on Russian energy during her tenure. However, recent developments due to the war, as well as advances in Nuclear safety, shows the tides turning on nuclear power generation \[6\]. 1. While the US has declined on this front, the EU is still very much pushing for sustainable energy sources. While Nuclear isn’t really considered renewable, it is considered clean, and nuclear energy makes up around 1/4th of EU energy production today. So, we are betting on Nuclear being a big component of the future for the EU, and abroad. So, why District Metals? If you want to own the end-to-end cycle of your energy infrastructure, that includes mining for Uranium. In the EU, Sweden has the highest amount of unconventional uranium resources. The Viken deposit, wholly owned by District Metals, is the largest undeveloped mineral resource estimate of Uranium in the world \[7\]. One impact assessment puts the Viken project at a net present value of 1.039B, assuming $65.3/pound of U3O8, which is now at $\~80/Pound \[9\]. Uranium resources haven’t been able to be developed or deeply explored due to legislation preventing mining in 2018 in Sweden, but with new political headwinds and wide support, this law is likely to be overturned on January 1st \[8\]. CEO Garret Ainsworth has a track record of other mining projects, including NextGen where he started as VP, overseeing a market capitalization from $50m CDN to $3B CDN. But, worst case is the project doesn’t take off in the long run, I think the short term shows significant upside as the regulatory landscape changes. \[1\] [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030) \[2\] [https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030\_en](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en) \[3\] [https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/motion/focus/eu-budget-ensures-european-energy-independence-through-repowereu\_en](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/motion/focus/eu-budget-ensures-european-energy-independence-through-repowereu_en) \[4\] [https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/data-centre-growth-in-the-nordics](https://www.paconsulting.com/insights/data-centre-growth-in-the-nordics) \[5\] [https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sweden-data-center-market](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sweden-data-center-market) \[6\] [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power) \[7\] [https://www.placera.se/pressmeddelanden/district-metals-district-confirms-the-viken-energy-metals-deposit-and-identifies-high-potential-targets-elsewhere-on-the-viken-property-in-sweden-with-airborne-mobilemt-survey-results-20250924](https://www.placera.se/pressmeddelanden/district-metals-district-confirms-the-viken-energy-metals-deposit-and-identifies-high-potential-targets-elsewhere-on-the-viken-property-in-sweden-with-airborne-mobilemt-survey-results-20250924) \[8\] [https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/legislative-proposals-to-lift-swedens-uranium-mining-ban](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/legislative-proposals-to-lift-swedens-uranium-mining-ban) \[9\] [https://secure.kaiserresearch.com/i/jk/tr16/TRCZQ20101019.pdf](https://secure.kaiserresearch.com/i/jk/tr16/TRCZQ20101019.pdf)",2,0,2025-10-13 16:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o5oyng/district_metals_dmxv_capitalizing_on_multiple/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.894754,0.4,$T,0.6,[],"['puts', 'support', 'market cap']",0.6171428571428571,Communication Services

Shares are now up roughly 153 % year-to-date. **Today’s Catalyst (October 30 2025)** * Copper Quest will acquire the **2,954-hectare Kitimat Copper-Gold Project**, located roughly 10 km northwest of the deep-water port community of **Kitimat, BC**. * The property lies within the **Skeena Mining Division** and is accessible year-round via logging and mineral-exploration roads. It is only about **10 km from tidewater, 1.5 km from rail, and 6 km from hydroelectric transmission lines**, giving it excellent infrastructure. * The project sits within the **Stikine Terrane**, a prolific belt that hosts numerous porphyry copper-gold systems. Its main target, the **Jeannette Cu-Au Zone**, shows alteration and mineralization consistent with a larger porphyry system. * Historical drilling by **Decade Resources (2010)** returned long, continuous copper-gold intercepts, including: * 117.07 m grading 1.03 g/t Au and 0.54 % Cu (from 1.52 m) * 103.65 m grading 1.00 g/t Au and 0.55 % Cu (from 9.15 m) * 107.01 m grading 0.80 g/t Au and 0.45 % Cu (from 6.10 m) * 112.20 m grading 0.41 g/t Au and 0.33 % Cu (from 11.89 m) * Under the agreement, Copper Quest has until **January 5 2026** to complete due diligence. On **January 6 2026**, upon closing, it will issue **2,000,000 common shares** to vendor **Bernie Kreft** as full consideration. * The project carries a **2.5 % NSR royalty**, 40 % of which can be repurchased for C$1 million. Copper Quest also retains a **right of first refusal** on any sale of the remaining royalty. * Mr. Kreft is a well-known Canadian prospector and former star of *Discovery Channel’s Yukon Gold* with a long record of mineral discoveries. **Why It’s Moving** This deal adds another British Columbia copper-gold asset to Copper Quest’s growing critical-minerals portfolio.

Market reacts by jumping 25% despite otherwise lackluster Q3 results for CIFR. I'm struggling with the math here though. AMZN is basically renting a 300MW fully built out HPC data center for 15 years or about 366M/yr. Total cost to CIFR for a 300MW facility would be about 3B or about 10m/MW based on comaprison to what other companies have been reporting and estimates for CIFR costs in its own fluidstack deal announced a month ago. OPEX costs are estimated at about 135M/yr or .45m/MW which is towards the low end of what others in the HPC infrastructure space are paying (Notably-IREN).

T,1oj8h8w,ValueInvesting,Sell Side Equity Research Certification,"Hello everyone, I’m a college student interested in pursuing a career in equity research, and I wanted to ask if anyone found the Sell-Side Equity Research Certification on Wall Street Prep helpful. I’m not planning to take the course just to get an interview or a job — I mainly want to build real skills and understand how the career works. I’ve tried several times to join a student-managed investment fund on campus, but haven’t landed a position, and I know that would help me fully grasp the technical side and the thought process behind research and banking. I know the course is pricey, but if it truly helps build the skill set needed in this field, I’m willing to invest in it. I’ve tried using YouTube and other free resources, but I often end up feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to focus on. If there are some you recommend, please let me know, but I think a structured course helps me stay consistent and learn in an organized way. I’d really appreciate any feedback from those who have taken it — was it worth it, and did it help you better understand the equity research process?

T,1o3vcaw,ValueInvesting,Made a SaaS side project to help small funds and family offices from paying for market data and software they don’t need,"I’ve worked in financial SaaS companies selling market data and analytics solutions. One thing I keep seeing is people completely forgetting when their subscriptions auto-renew or when they need to cancel, which ends up costing them way more than expected every year. On top of that, surprise price hikes don’t help either. I hate being the one to tell them their subscription has renewed. It’s even more frustrating for them, but unfortunately, that’s what’s written in their subscription contracts. So, I started a side project to build a simple tool to help these smaller clients keep track of their subscriptions, avoid sneaky auto-renewals, and dodge surprise price hikes. I’m still testing it out, so if you manage market data subscriptions or know someone who does, I’d love for you to try it and share your thoughts. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thanks a ton!

I was hoping he would forget, he has severe autism, like his stepdad. Well, the next day, he didn’t forget. I asked what he wanted so badly at McDonald’s. He replied that he wanted a happy meal with monopoly. I dont even know how my son knows about monopoly, I’ve sure never played monopoly with him.

T,1ojc0ek,stocks,Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis point in a split decision.,"It's benchmark interest rate cut to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%. Fed Governor Stephen Miran disagreed with the decision, preferring to cut rates by half a percentage point. Meanwhile, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid also dissented, advocating for holding rates steady. Miran is concerned that renewed trade tensions with China, which have since settled, posed risks to the economic outlook. He doesn’t see tariffs leading to higher inflation and wants to avoid causing damage to the labor market. Schmid has said inflation is still too high and the current level of interest rates is the “right place to be.” Policymakers indicated that “Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up, but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments,” and “downside risks to employment rose in recent months.” In September, Fed officials cut the interest rate for the first time this year, and the median of the 19-member FOMC committee penciled in two more rate cuts this year. Official labor market data through August showed a sharp slowdown in payroll growth. Officials have not received the jobs report for September due to the shutdown and have had to rely on private sector data and anecdotal surveys, which have shown continued weakness in payroll growth.

T,1okzd6o,ValueInvesting,The Market Forgets Fast,"It’s funny how quickly the market moves on. You’d think people would remember how it felt in late 2022 when the S&P 500 was down about 25%, the Nasdaq crashed over 35%, inflation was spiraling, and every major analyst was predicting a full-blown recession. Goldman was talking about 3,000 on the S&P, Burry called for 1,800, and the word “stagflation” was everywhere. Meta was the perfect example of despair. Down 75% from its highs, everyone said the metaverse was a money pit and Zuckerberg was finished. Amazon’s profits vanished, Google’s ad business slowed, Microsoft cooled off, and Tesla traded near $113. It felt like the end of a cycle, maybe even the end of the market as people knew it. But the market did what it always does, it turned when everyone had already given up. Inflation eased through 2023, rate hikes paused, and suddenly the same companies that were written off came roaring back. Meta doubled, then doubled again. Nvidia’s run looked unreal. The Nasdaq had its strongest year in two decades, and by early 2024, the same names that were “done” were back at new highs. Now here we are, late 2025, and the story’s shifted again. The Fed’s cutting rates after two years of tightening. Inflation’s around 3%, earnings are still solid, and the S&P is pushing new highs. Yet, the mood isn’t the same. Confidence is slipping, the job market’s softening, and spending at the lower end is slowing down. Uex like bitget also offering access to stocks with some mstr shares for users, showing how much the landscape keeps blending and evolving. That’s the thing about markets, they never stay in one mood for long. When it’s falling, it feels endless. When it’s flying, it feels safe. Neither is true.

T,1op3l15,investing,"AI’s next constraint is megawatts, not GPUs (IEA, ERCOT, PJM)","Everyone’s modeling AI demand in terms of chips. The gating factor showing up in the data is electricity. The IEA’s 2025 work pegs global data-center consumption at roughly 945 TWh by 2030 - about double today and just under 3% of world electricity. They also put the growth pace around 15%/yr through 2030, with the U.S. driving the largest share. That’s not a vibe; it’s a load curve. You can see the strain show up in prices where AI clusters. In PJM, the latest capacity auction printed $16.1B, up $7.3B (+82%) vs. the prior auction, and the market monitor said data centers were the primary reason. That’s a concrete cost of scarcity for tenants who thought ""power later"" was a viable plan. ""Just add more grid"" isn’t fast. LBNL’s Queued Up 2024 shows the typical project that reached COD in 2023 took \~5 years from interconnection request - up from <2 years in the 2000s. In the meantime, the queue itself is multi-terawatt. The takeaway: utility interconnects don’t match AI deployment timelines. Regional forecasts underline the same thing. ERCOT is now working off scenarios where Texas data centers add \~35 GW by 2035 - a massive slice of the system. Nationally, BNEF has U.S. data-center load more than doubling to \~78 GW by 2035. Regardless of your view on AI valuations, the power leg of the buildout still has room to run. For investors, the frame I’m using is time-to-power. When capacity markets reprice scarcity and grid queues stretch, the economic value shifts to anything that compresses ""months to megawatts"": behind-the-meter microgrids, storage, fast-track interconnects, long-lead electrical equipment (transformers/switchgear), and developers who can actually deliver SLAs on schedule. Tenants that can bring firm, dispatchable power to site - or hedge peaks with storage - have a real advantage when everyone else is waiting on utilities. Risks? Sure: if the macro or an AI inventory glut slows buildouts, demand could undershoot. The IEA’s ""headwind"" scenario trims that 2030 data-center number materially. Local siting, water/cooling rules, and fuel costs also matter. But the base case is still tight power where AI clusters, and that pushes capital toward onsite solutions. I don’t have positions to disclose here. If you’re mapping the space, keep an eye on time-to-power integrators in microgrids and fleet-energy - think ""bring your own megawatts"" while the grid catches up.

T,1o6t2i7,wallstreetbets,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Tendies","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion. **Executive Summary:** Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. **Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains** Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys). Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security). **Revenue Acceleration Levers** Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services). To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics. **Technology Roadmap & Differentiation** Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this: * Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft. * Drone/UAV structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical). * Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream. Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere. Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables. **Strategic Positioning in Drones/UAVs** Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to UAV endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered UAV with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market. [Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk) [Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale. [Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET. **AI in print process optimization** Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware. **TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:** * Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified. * Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware. * Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA). * Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production. * Drones & UAVs - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing * AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat [Oh and lastly there is also this.](https://imgur.com/a/JtxgF9F) My review above might explain why a US representative, with a history of picking winners, that is sitting on the military construction subcommittee is buying $SSYS.

Under the agreement, details of which were released on Monday, JPMorgan will invest $75 million of its own funds for a nearly 3% stake in Perpetua, which is building the largest U.S. antimony mine about 138 miles (222 km) north of Boise, Idaho. The agreement was signed on Sunday and was expected to close on Tuesday. The bank, which holds roughly 20,000 shares of Perpetua currently, according to LSEG data, will also have the option to exercise $42 million in warrants within three years. There are no existing U.S. sources of antimony, which is also used to make solar panels, lubricants, flame retardants and other goods. China, the world's largest antimony miner and processor, blocked exports in late 2024, causing Western manufacturers to scramble for fresh supply. Announced earlier this month, JPMorgan's Security and Resiliency Initiative aims to offset what CEO Jamie Dimon said was the ""painfully clear"" reality ""that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals."" ""With this investment, we are supporting a company in an industry critical to national security and American resiliency, precisely the focus of our new initiative,"" said Doug Petno, co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank division. The mine, backed by billionaire investor John Paulson, will supply more than 35% of America's annual antimony needs once it opens by 2028 and also produce 450,000 ounces of gold each year. The dual revenue stream is expected to keep the project financially afloat regardless of any steps by Beijing to sway markets. The site, which is under construction as of last week, has estimated reserves of 148 million pounds of antimony and 6 million ounces of gold.

Bought in at $240, and when it shot up to $298, I literally took a screenshot feeling like a genius. Then it tanked. Lost around $1100. I told myself, “Lesson learned. Never again.” Fast forward to last week. I thought I had matured as an investor. Then came BYND, FOMO hype everywhere. I told myself it’s just a small trade… jumped in, and yep, lost around $600. Now, around 90–95% of my portfolio is actually in solid long-term holdings: Google, Amazon, ASML, etc. I only play with 5–10% for this kind of stuff. But the money isn’t the main issue. It’s the principle. I keep telling myself I’ve learned my lesson, and then somehow I repeat the same emotional mistake.

T,1o63dnv,stocks,"Tata Electronics acquires Chinese iPhone supplier Justech’s India unit for about $100 million, sources say","Tata Electronics has acquired Chinese industrial firm Justech Precision’s India unit for close to $100 million, according to two people familiar with the matter, as the Tata Group subsidiary bolsters its manufacturing capacity to benefit from Apple’s focus on iPhone manufacturing in India. The transaction was concluded in August, with HSBC Bank and HDFC Bank advising on the deal, according to the people close to the deal. Headquartered in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, China, Justech Precision has been a supplier to Apple since 2008. It provides industrial equipment, such as computer numerical control machines used for precise cutting and fabrication tasks, to Foxconn, the world’s largest assembler of Apple products. Justech Precision Industry India, incorporated in late 2019 and based in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comments, neither did Tata Group. Tata Electronics declined to comment. In January, Tata Electronics reportedly bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron’s India operation that operates an iPhone plant, Reuters reported. The deal’s value was not disclosed. The acquisitions come as Tata Electronics, which began assembling iPhones in India in 2023, seeks to expand its manufacturing capacity as Apple reportedly plans to source all of the iPhones for the U.S. market from India by the end of 2026. Apple, which still manufacturers most of its smartphones in China, has been taking urgent steps to build capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn, pivoting away from China amid higher tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Foxconn still accounts for two-thirds of India’s total iPhones shipments, with Tata making the remaining one-third, according to Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president at market research firm Counterpoint Research, who expects that market share could change soon as Tata scales up its manufacturing. Tata currently operates two plants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which was formerly owned by Wistron. # Made in India by 2026 Apple started looking for manufacturing alternatives after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown in China disrupted output at its largest assembly plant. The heightened Beijing-Washington tensions and tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the U.S. this year have prompted Apple to accelerate the shift in production. U.S. President Donald Trump initially slapped prohibitive triple-digit tariffs on imports from China before granting a temporary reprieve for smartphones shipments. Despite India also facing high tariffs from the U.S., iPhones made in India don’t attract any duties as of now. Apple’s shift in production to India instead of the U.S. has angered Trump, who in May threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years worked to promote India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high-tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development. But Apple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengaluru assembling older model iPhones, which saw a labor riot in late 2020. Apple is looking to build “highly localized” partners to become “truly diversified,” instead of bringing Chinese or Taiwanese partners in India and be dependent on them, Shah said, but finding alternatives for components sourced primarily from Chinese suppliers could take years. “It will not be a sprint to build like-for-like supplier ecosystem as it enjoyed in China, but a marathon and a step by step process,” Shah added. India will account for around 26% of global iPhone shipments by the end of 2025, up from 20% at the start of the year, according to the latest estimate by Counterpoint. Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Justech’s innovation exhibition center in Jiangsu during his trip to China in March where he pledged to continue to make large-scale investment in the country.

T,1ojezuz,ValueInvesting,NVO – Dip before the rip?,"1. Novo Nordisk has an oral version of semaglutide (25 mg) under FDA review for weight loss – it would be the first oral GLP-1 drug for obesity. 2. The FDA accepted the application on May 2, 2025, and granted priority review, which comes with a 6-month target. 3. The target decision date is November 2, 2025 (a Sunday), so the announcement will most likely come on Friday, October 31 – probably between 4:30 PM and 7:00 PM ET, after the market closes. 4. The approval probability is about 90%, based on strong clinical trial results (15% average weight loss), no safety red flags, and prior approvals of the same drug in other forms. 5. The FDA meets its 6-month priority review deadline 95–98% of the time. Weekend deadlines almost always result in a Friday decision. 6. If approved, the stock could jump 8–18% by Monday morning. This drug could add $5–10 billion in annual sales. 7. Novo will have a monopoly on oral GLP-1 drugs for 6–12 months. Eli Lilly’s competing pill (orforglipron) won’t be filed until late 2025 and launched around mid-2026. 8. The U.S. government has been in shutdown since October 1, 2025. The FDA is not accepting new drug applications during this time – so Lilly’s filing is delayed. Novo’s review is unaffected because it started before the shutdown. Bottom line: Novo is likely 2 days away from approving the world’s first weight-loss pill, with no competition, while a government shutdown blocks its main rival.

But gold has appreciated 50 to 70% YTD against all of the world’s major currencies, not just the USD. Including havens like Switzerland (CHF) 1) The weakening U.S. Dollar - The DXY bottomed in mid-September and has actually risen since. Gold was $3600 then; now it’s $4350. 2) The U.S. government shutdown - None of the previous 20+ shutdowns have ever caused permanent economic damage. It’s all political theater and will be resolved. 3) Federal Reserve easing - The bond market expects another 1% in easing over the next 12 months, taking rates down to neutral. The FOMC’s 3% neutral estimate hasn’t changed in a while. They only go below neutral during a recession. 4) Federal Reserve independence - During the September meeting, the rest of the FOMC treated Miran like a gadfly, voting 11-1 against him. 5) Geopolitical tensions - The Gaza conflict is now in a ceasefire. The Russia-Ukraine war is regionally contained. 6) Trade tensions - Trade deals have been negotiated with all of the largest trading partners except China. Trump has caved on China before; tariffs were 140% at one point before he lowered them. Notably, the bond market has not jumped in on the debasement trade. Treasury yields are at their second lowest of the year after the initial April tariff panic. In the current parabolic move that began on August 21, gold has risen from $3,350 to $4,350 per ounce, while many of the above bull-case catalysts have stabilized or even improved.

As investors sold silver ETFs during the rate hike cycle, those funds redeemed shares and released real silver bars from vaults into the market. That extra inventory plugged the deficit between rising industrial demand and flat mine supply, keeping price contained. But entering 2025, that cushion is effectively gone: -Vault inventories are now thin in Comex and despite London reporting 800millipn ounces, they recently needed an 8 figure injection ounce-wise from U.S vaults.(Comex registered silver ytd 45,986,154 oz) -New demand must be met directly with physical metal -Delivery pressure is rising while mine supply still can’t grow as fast as silver prices rise . (72% of mined silver is byproduct=silver supply doesn’t react in correlation with silver price) -ETF flows are no longer supplying the market, they’re either neutral or turning positive -The price has not yet adjusted to years of real deficits So the era of “fixing the shortage quietly through ETF drains” is over.

Here’s the pattern I’ve noticed (and maybe you relate): You find a “promising” company. * You spend hours reading their 10-K, 10-Q, transcripts. * You build a DCF, maybe two. * You adjust a few variables until the model “feels” right. * And then you still don’t buy because you need just a bit more confirmation. Meanwhile, weeks go by, and the stock either moves or the opportunity fades. It feels like we’re all trying to be miniature Buffetts, but with way less information advantage and way more noise. And the amount of mental energy this takes is insane. I’ve been thinking a lot about this: Maybe the bottleneck in modern value investing isn’t intelligence. It’s analysis paralysis. There’s just too much data, too many metrics, too many opinions and the process that used to give us clarity now gives us confusion. So my question is: How do you personally balance depth of analysis with speed of decision? Have you found any way (tool, framework, process) that actually reduces analysis time without losing accuracy? Because right now, it feels like the hardest part of investing isn’t finding undervalued companies it’s filtering the noise fast enough to act before it’s too late.",72,98,2025-10-23 18:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oeb18k/are_we_all_overanalyzing_value_investing_today/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.069807,0.35,$T,0.6,[],[],0.8999999999999999,Communication Services
T,1omspjn,financialindependence,How do you decide your “enough” number if you want to die with almost zero?,"I’ve been planning to retire at 60 with $2M (4% rule ≈ $80K/year). But I’ve realized that if I keep aiming for $2M, I’ll spend more years working — years I could instead be spending with my aging parents while they’re still alive. I don’t have kids and don’t plan to leave $2M inheritance to charity, so I don’t want to die with $2M sitting unused. At the same time, I can’t aim to die with exactly zero because I don’t know how long I’ll live and i need money until the last day i live. Now I’m debating: * Would you aim for less than $2M and retire earlier, maybe using a higher 5% withdrawal rate to still target around $80K/year? * Or, if you don’t want to leave $2M to charity but also can’t plan to die with exactly zero, how do you decide what number to die with? Is there a formula or framework for that? For those who’ve retired early or adopted a “spend‑down” mindset, how did you figure out what was truly *enough* — without oversaving and missing the chance to spend time with loved ones?",122,96,2025-11-02 20:58:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1omspjn/how_do_you_decide_your_enough_number_if_you_want/,2025-11-07 16:44:36.082744,0.35,$T,0.5,[],[],0.8999999999999999,Communication Services

T,1onp9sf,ValueInvesting,What are the best apps for stock market news that don't push clickbait paywalls and sponsored fluff pieces all the time?,"For the most part, I stick to news related to what I'm holding. I also like to keep an eye on macro trends without getting lobotomized by curated headlines, clickbait, and fin influencers. I've heard that some firms out there have access to ultra-fast news APIs (or roided-up RSS feed aggregators) that can get in and out of positions before the news even gets traction. I can't really compete with that... however, I'm looking to optimize my 'stock market news stack' to a similar effect within what's available in app form. News alerts don't really work, but having a streamlined workflow that ingest news and sentiment seems like a good way to spot opportunities early. I'm still refining the set up, but these are the stock market news apps I'm using the most right now: **Reddit.com**: It's still surprising how regularly serious posts can surface with good research and opinions. Makes you realize that some of the best due diligence still lives in random comment threads. **Stocktwits.com****:** I monitor their trending lists and sentiment meter to identify when a ticker’s mentions spike or the bull/bear ratio shifts. It’s useful for spotting unusual chatter around a stock before volume surges. I tend to watch their live earnings feeds to catch sentiment swings during calls. **Ground News**: Their market coverage isn’t huge, but I like seeing how they line up bias and sources side by side. Helps filter out the noise. **Legacy Finance Media:** I still check Bloomberg, Reuters, FT, and Barron’s. The paywalls are annoying, but every so often they actually drop something worth your time. I’m always on the lookout for ways to cut through the noise without leaning too heavily in one direction or getting lost in the hype.

T,1okbst2,ValueInvesting,The Magnet Manufacturers Are Still Mispriced,"The market’s finally woken up to rare-earth miners, but it’s still ignoring the next step up the value chain — the magnet manufacturers that turn those materials into finished products. China’s latest export control move made it obvious: the West can’t build EVs, wind turbines, or advanced defense systems without a homegrown magnet supply chain. Policy support is coming — we’ve already seen it with chips (CHIPS Act) and batteries (IRA). Magnets are next. Assuming that’s true, who do ya’ll like? Here’s some I’m looking into: • Iluka Resources (ILKAF) – profitable refiner, low debt, steady cash flow, trading at single-digit forward earnings. • Neo Performance Materials (NOPMF) – the only Western producer of rare-earth magnets at commercial scale; solid balance sheet, dividend yield ~2–3 %, trades at roughly 1× sales. • Metso (OUKPY) – diversified industrial with exposure to the coming refinery build-out; yield near 2.5 %. • MKS Instruments (MKSI) – high-margin industrial tools supplier tied to materials and magnet fabrication; recently de-levered after a major acquisition. All of these are cash-flow positive, asset-heavy industrials trading at cheap valuations relative to their future policy-driven earnings growth. The market’s still treating them as boring miners or toolmakers — not as strategic assets that are about to get multi-billion-dollar tailwinds. TL;DR: These magnet-chain companies are the kind of setup for underpriced value — under-followed, policy-protected, and producing real stuff. They’re not “the next semiconductors,” but they’re about to get the same money and margin expansion treatment. Not financial advice.

They trust it. They send and receive money with it because it “just works,” and they feel safe. That brand trust is real, and in payments that still matters. Wall Street basically acts like this business is fading out, but if you look at the model and the numbers, it still looks very alive long term. **DCF I ran** [here](https://www.insicard.com/start-analysis/PYPL.US) **(conservative):** * I assumed only \~5.4%/yr revenue growth and margins easing from \~18% → 16%. * Still get a **fair value ≈ $100/share** vs stock in the high 60s / low 70s → \~30% undervalued. **Financials:** * **P/E \~15** → market is pricing this like a boring mature financial, not a growth tech stock. * **Revenue still up**, management is guiding continued growth and even **double-digit EPS growth**. * Balance sheet is fine: they generate strong cash and aren’t drowning in debt. * **Aggressive buybacks**: they’re using billions in free cash flow to shrink the float, which boosts **earnings per share** even if topline only inches up. **Business model (why I think it’s still alive in 10 years):** * Massive scale: **$400B+ TPV per quarter** and **\~430M+ active accounts**, and volume/revenue are still growing (mid single digit YoY, not hypergrowth but not dead). * It’s not just “the PayPal button.” It’s checkout (PayPal/Venmo), merchant processing (Braintree), fraud/identity, global payouts. * **Partnership with Google**: PayPal is plugging deeper into Google Ads / Play / Cloud and using Google’s AI + infra.

T,1o78k68,stocks,"$SSYS: Certified to Print Drones, Aerospace parts, and Great Returns On Investment","I’m long SSYS as I believe it is a massive sleeper play when it comes to drone/aircraft development and American military industrialization/ expansion. **Executive Summary:** Stratasys ( $SSYS) is a leading additive manufacturing company with a strong installed base and differentiated position in polymer 3D printing for industrial applications. A particularly compelling growth driver for this company lies in its aerospace and defense vertical, where Stratasys is one of the few players with qualified thermoplastics (e.g., ULTEM 9085/1010) and certified processes for flight-ready parts. This position benefits from the aerospace sector’s record backlog and from the defense departments demand for lightweight, durable components in contemporary aircraft and drones where additive manufacturing enables on-demand part replacement, weight reduction, and customization. Military adoption is accelerating due to the need for distributed logistics and digital warehousing, with Stratasys printers already being deployed for tooling, brackets, housings, and spare parts in aging aircraft fleets. Looking ahead, further integration of automation and AI for generative design could transform Stratasys from a hardware vendor into a critical software-enabled platform for mission-critical manufacturing, creating sticky revenue streams and strategic relevance in defense supply chains. **Stratasys Strategic Positioning in Aerospace/Defense Supply Chains** Aerospace and defense primes (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Airbus, etc.) have extremely stringent certification standards for parts. Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling and ULTEM 9085/1010 thermoplastics are among the few already qualified for flight-ready parts. This creates a high barrier to entry for competitors. Once qualified, these parts become part of multi-year aircraft programs, locking Stratasys into recurring revenue streams (THINK -> strong qualification & certification moat for Stratasys). Furthermore, 3D printing close to the point of need reduces dependence on fragile global supply chains. Stratasys is positioning its printers as tools for distributed manufacturing, especially in forward-deployed military operations (THINK -> DoD & NATO supply chain security). **Revenue Acceleration Levers** Defense contractors don’t just buy one 3D printer, they often roll them out across multiple facilities once qualification is achieved. Each printer also locks in recurring high-margin consumables like filaments and resins. Furthermore, Stratasys direct manufacturing could see DoD contracts for on-demand spare part printing, turning the company into a “digital warehouse” for legacy aircraft parts. For example, the Air Force has thousands of aging aircraft (C-130, KC-135, F-16) where traditional parts are obsolete. Additive manufacturing is one of the only viable solutions. (THINK -> Pseudo razor and blades business model when it comes to a 3D printer install base and subsequent high-margin consumables and on-demand part production services). To further expand on this “digital warehousing” concept… The DoD has an initiative for a military digital thread that focuses on creating a comprehensive, secure, and interconnected system of digital assets and data across the entire lifecycle of a defense system, from conceptualization to sustainment. This includes the idea of storing qualified part files in secure databases with the subsequent goal of manufacturing or printing them on demand at needed locations. The technology/product that Stratasys provides directly aligns with the Pentagon’s logistics resilience goal. And this military digital thread initiative will only further expand as defense budgets increase globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) where additive manufacturing helps with distributed logistics. **Technology Roadmap & Differentiation** Stratasys is moving into carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and high-temp polymers (PEKK, PEI blends) that can replace aluminum in aerospace parts. There are multiple defense applications for this: * Lightweight ducting, housings, brackets in aircraft. * Drone structural parts (where low weight and quick customization are critical). * Tooling & jigs for production lines, an overlooked but large revenue stream. Furthermore, Stratasys isn’t just about hardware, it’s about locking customers into a digital ecosystem (GrabCAD Print, software certification layers, material traceability). Much like NVIDIA uses its CUDA software stack to create switching costs and capture value well beyond the GPU itself, Stratasys is building a certification and compliance-driven ecosystem that embeds its technology deep into aerospace and defense supply chains, making it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere. Overall, all of this positions Stratasys as not just a printer maker but a platform company in the defense supply chain… recurring SaaS/service revenues layered on hardware + consumables. **Strategic Positioning in Drones** Stratasys technology amplifies drone manufacturing/development through rapid prototyping, lightweight, topology-optimized structures, and high-performance polymer materials like carbon fiber and nylon, driving weight reduction critical to drone endurance and performance. Their additive tech enables custom, mission-specific components such as payload mounts, brackets, and battery compartments enabling faster product iterations and on-demand production. There are great real world proofs for this -> Aurora Flight Sciences printed a jet-powered drone with 80% of its structural parts in ULTEM 9085 resin, achieving over 150 mph with a 50% reduction in time-to-market. [Link 1](https://imgur.com/a/2a2Z6jk) [Link 2](https://imgur.com/a/agf7v8w) Furthermore, the U.S. Army is leaning hard into 3D printing for drones to cut costs, boost training realism, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Units like the 101st Airborne, Hawaii’s 25th Infantry Division and the Oregon National Guard are already utilizing 3D printing for low-cost UAS at scale. [Link 3](https://imgur.com/a/veBKaEC) As additive manufacturing builds on and moves from prototypes/experiments to repeated utilization and eventually military doctrine, the financial opportunity clearly turns into recurring demand for printers + materials across the defense ecosystem as I have mentioned above, Stratasys' aerospace/drones verticle is set to take off just watch. Stratasys is set up to be a quiet but critical enabler, a drones picks and shovels play that almost no investors have yet to identify... YET. **AI in print process optimization** Traditional 3D printing is trial-and-error intensive. Aerospace/defense requires near-zero defect tolerance. Stratasys incorporates generative AI principles, such as generative design, within its additive manufacturing solutions by collaborating with software partners like Autodesk to create optimized, lightweight parts. This improves yield rates (fewer failed builds), lowers scrap, and makes additive competitive for higher-volume aerospace parts. Stratasys benefits when engineers use AI to create lighter, more complex, organic structures that only additive can manufacture. This increases margin leverage; less waste, higher throughput, accelerates qualification for critical parts and further establishes a moat with their software + hardware. **TLDR Bulleted summary of most important points:** * Sticky Vertical - Aerospace/defense is highly regulated, which favors Stratasys once certified. * Recurring Revenue Growth – Every installed printer drives materials + service revenue, often more valuable than hardware. * Software complements hardware – Stratasys has a certification and compliance driven ecosystem that makes it difficult and costly for customers to move elsewhere for additive manufacturing (parallels to how NVIDIA utilizes CUDA). * Macro Tailwinds – Pentagon pushing for resilient supply chains. Increasing defense budgets globally (esp. in NATO, Indo-Pacific and South America) will likely require additive manufacturing as it support distributed logistics. Commercial aerospace backlogs are at record highs, large aerospace companies will likely need additive manufacturing to scale production. * Drones - Stratasys technology can greatly amplify drone development and manufacturing * AI Optimization – Stratasys is poised to benefit from AI more than most other military defense and manufacturing companies based on their unique technology and moat [Oh and lastly there is also this.](https://imgur.com/a/JtxgF9F) My review above might explain why a US representative, with a history of picking winners, that is sitting on the military construction subcommittee is buying $SSYS.

By itself, it is not concerning because M2 money supply, the economy and market capitalization have all risen considerably over the past decade. In general, when investors are bullish and confident, they use more leverage to amplify their bets. When they’re worried, they reduce their margin balances to cut risk.

I’m not talking about blowing money or lifestyle inflation — more about being able to enjoy what I’ve earned without guilt or anxiety. # My Ask For those who’ve reached (or are near) financial independence: * How did you *mentally* transition from saving to spending? * What helped you feel okay using your money for comfort, fun, or time-saving conveniences? * Any frameworks, “rules,” or mindset shifts that made it easier? * Did you find setting aside a specific “fun budget” helped, or did something else click mentally? # What I’m Trying to Work On * Reframing money as a *tool for living*, not just a scoreboard. * Accepting that my kids’ memories and my own comfort might matter more than optimizing every basis point. * Learning that “enough” might actually mean… enough.

Make sure it has good drainage, good soil and a spot that you can leave it and not have to bother it for a long time. Water it periodically, on a schedule if you can, not too much and not too little. If the plant gets a little big you can trim it back a touch, if it develops problems tend to it and figure out what’s up and what needs to change. Pruning and occasional maintenance help it grow… Be patient, be kind to yourself and it. Don’t watch it every day, you won’t notice a difference and you may even fuck with it too much.

T,1okxba6,financialindependence,A quick formula for retirement longevity,">**Edit / Update:** I’ve revised the heuristic after reviewing the constant, check the bottom of the post for the updated formula and explanation. Ever wonder how long your portfolio might actually last on a given withdrawal rate, without running a single spreadsheet? Hey FI friends! I've been playing around with a simple math formula to estimate how long a portfolio might last given a safe withdrawal rate and expected real return. Surprisingly, the heuristic tracks historical and Monte Carlo results really well. **The Formula:** `(72 / SWR) × 1.67 × √(r_real / 2) = Portfolio Longevity (yrs)` Example with a 4% withdrawal rate and 3% real return: `(72 ÷ 4) × 1.67 × √(3/2) = 36.8 yrs` SWR | r_real | Heuristic | 4% Rule / Historical | Monte Carlo Median -----|--------|-----------|--------------------|------------------ 3% | 2% | 40 | 45 | 50 4% | 2% | 30 | 30 | 35 4% | 3% | 37 | 35 | 38 5% | 2% | 24 | 23 | 28 6% | 3% | 24.5 | 23 | 25 7% | 4% | 24.3 | 22 | 25 This simple heuristic is close to historical/Monte Carlo results, while being easy to calculate. It’s not perfect, but it’s quick and easy. No spreadsheets, just a rough model for SWR and longevity. However, very low (<3%) or high (>8%) SWRs may deviate due to sequence-of-returns risk. **Disclaimer:** This is a simple heuristic for quick calculations. It’s not a guaranteed prediction of portfolio longevity and doesn’t replace a full financial plan or detailed simulations. Sequence-of-returns risk and individual circumstances can significantly affect outcomes. I'd love to know your opinions and see if this heuristic matches your retirement plans. Plug in your own numbers and see how it goes. **Edit / Update:** After digging deeper and reviewing the heuristic, I realized the original constant (1.67) breaks down outside the low-return environment of the classic 4% rule. For example: - With higher expected real returns, the original heuristic could give overly optimistic results, like suggesting a 30-year retirement is possible on a 7% SWR with a 6% real return. - Applying it to Bengen’s updated 4.7% SWR and 5.1% real return gives a longevity of 40.8 years, nowhere near the 30-year target Bengen proposed. After reevaluating the constant, I've refined an adaptive formula that works across a wider range of market conditions. **Revised formula:** `(72 / SWR) × (1.67 - 0.15 × √(r_real - 2)) × √(r_real / 2) = L` Where: SWR = annual withdrawal rate (%) r_real = expected average real return (%) L = estimated portfolio longevity (years) The updated formula is slightly longer and more complex than the original, but it helps prevent unrealistic longevity estimates while still being calculator-friendly.",11,25,2025-10-31 15:15:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1okxba6/a_quick_formula_for_retirement_longevity/,2025-11-07 16:44:36.085257,0.35,$T,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999,Communication Services

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

T,1o3j65j,stocks,Gilat Satellite (GILT) might be seriously under radar and undervalued,"We are talking about an Israeli satcom/defense company with 35 years of story, it is valued like a small cap at $874,08 mi, despite projecting a guidance of $450 million total revenue in 2025, that's 45% increase compared to 2024 YoY. It is currently trading at around 25–30 times forward EPS despite growing revenue over 40% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA has climbed from about $30 million in 2022 to a projected $50 million for 2025, maintaining solid double-digit margins even as revenue grows more than 40%. But now let's dive in: What does it do? Gilat builds the hardware and software that let satellites deliver internet, military comms, and inflight Wi-Fi anywhere on Earth. It doesn’t launch satellites, it builds the infrastructure that makes satellites useful for its customers. Recent acquisitions: In recent years, Gilat acquired Wavestream, DataPath, and Stellar Blu to cover every layer of satellite communication, from radio amplifiers and tactical defense terminals to high-speed antennas for aircraft, turning itself from a modem maker into a full-scale satellite infrastructure company. All three based on American soil. Tech achievements: Gilat is transforming from a traditional satellite equipment supplier into a modern communications technology company. It develops cloud-based and AI-driven network platforms, advanced antennas for in-flight connectivity, and secure communication systems for defense and government use. Through its U.S. subsidiaries, the company now integrates hardware, software, and network management to support multi-orbit satellite operations (LEO, MEO, GEO). Its focus on virtualization, automation, and mobility positions Gilat as one of the leading players in next-generation satellite connectivity. Customers and contracts: Active contracts span defense, aviation, and government broadband programs worldwide with a total backlog of roughly US$450 million and customers ranging from the DoD (US$70 million), Israeli Army, OneWeb and national telecom agencies worldwide. Cash and debt: After the Stellar Blu acquisition, Gilat’s cash dropped from about $118 million to roughly $5 million, later rebuilt to around $65 million through a private share placement. Total debt stands near $100 million, leaving net debt around $30–40 million, a manageable level at less than one times projected 2025 EBITDA. Conclusion: In my view, Gilat is one of those “boring” and overlooked companies that deliver solid results and techs and have consistent growth, but lacks hype. It doesn’t build rockets or launch flashy satellites but it builds the wiring, antennas, and network brains that keep everything connected once those satellites are in orbit. It’s full of cables, code, and complex connectivity, but together they form the invisible backbone of defense communications, inflight Wi-Fi, and rural broadband. Gilat sits on the real infrastructure of global communication: profitable, under-the-radar, technically dense, and strategically essential for the defense industry, at a price of a small cap but with serious backlog, tech and guidance.",6,12,2025-10-11 01:41:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o3j65j/gilat_satellite_gilt_might_be_seriously_under/,2025-11-07 16:43:10.801349,0.35,$T,0.9,[],"['rocket', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit', 'eps', 'acquisition']",0.7342857142857142,Communication Services
T,1o6neku,ValueInvesting,stumbled onto something crazy by the looks of it (NTB - The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son),"Either I don't know anything about valuing banks or this is just too good to be true. Not sure, please help. Let's get right into it shall we: **Market cap = 1.75B** **Cash minus debt = 1.82 B** You might see this and conclude that maybe the bank is loss making or they are diluting like crazy or something is wrong? Well no because the buyback yield is 8% for the year, and they pay a dividend of 4.71% and have been for the last 10 years. With a payout ratio of 36% they are very healthy financially and profitable. **What do they do?** Well, they are a bank, for high net worth individuals who want to essentially not pay tax. The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son operates primarily as an offshore bank, focused on providing specialized financial services to high-net-worth individuals, institutions, and large corporations. Its operations are geographically concentrated in financially stable, low-tax jurisdictions, chiefly Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. **Moat** NTB's primary focus is on being a full-service bank and wealth manager in a few high-barrier-to-entry international financial centers like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, and Jersey. This specialization differentiates it from larger, global banks that treat these regions as secondary markets, and from smaller local banks that lack the international trust and wealth management scale. Founded in 1858, the bank has a deeply entrenched history and institutional reputation in its core markets. For high-net-worth clients whose primary concern is the safe, confidential, and multi-generational protection of their wealth, this long-standing stability and trusted brand acts as a significant moat that competitors cannot quickly purchase or replicate. The most substantial part of NTB’s moat comes from the difficulty and cost of moving its specialized services. Trust and Fiduciary Services involve complex legal, tax, and multi-jurisdictional administration. Changing the trustee of a complex, multi-generational trust is an expensive, legally onerous, and time-consuming process that strongly discourages customers from switching, making the revenue highly recurring. Private Banking relationships are often deep and built on decades of personal trust, which is highly sticky. **Catalyst** The management's primary focus is on returning capital, which includes a recently increased quarterly cash dividend and a new significant share repurchase authorization (1.5 million shares). With an 8% buyback yield and a stable dividend all we need to do is wait and collect until the market realizes the company's value.",9,10,2025-10-14 18:22:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o6neku/stumbled_onto_something_crazy_by_the_looks_of_it/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.888379,0.35,$T,0.6,[],"['dividend', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'profit', 'loss']",0.7285714285714285,Communication Services

I anticipate/hope we will get the statistics folks to reformulate the current market ratios and create new ones and tell us which ones are important and which ones aren’t and we’ll have at least 3 people who redefine the term ‘Bubble’ so that the answers will be a lot more nuanced then yes or no. We should welcome all of that and get everyone’s views because in the end, NONE of us will be completely correct! My take, we have too many young traders who treat the stock market like a casino. For that reason, uneducated sentiment has the capacity to drive dips and swells and volatility which we might call a ‘Bubble’ when too many gamblers are riding a group of stocks or indexes simply because they think they can time the market and market sentiment. But AI will escape the Bubble fate in the bear term because while it may be more expensive then past market leaders, it is not illogically priced and the opportunity to own a piece of the current technology is like the opportunity to own copper before electricity or oil before automobiles. And a key difference is that it is mostly intangible “Intellectual Property” that is owned and unlike a physical commodity, it can be leveraged an infinite amount of ways, so the earnings capacity of a single piece of AI code has almost limitless earnings capacity. The only limitation is the ability of the owner to build sufficient infrastructure to put it to work. Think about a new drug that cures every kind of cancer. Now imagine that we ALL have cancer. The stock of pharmaceutical companies can go up thousands of percent overnight if you are there on the day that the breakthrough is discovered. That’s how you have to think about AI, but it’s nit just curing cancer (and it WILL do that), it’s curing every illness and disease known and unknown, it is automating everything, it will simplify attainment and use of logic and knowledge in all aspects of our lives. As the hardware becomes better and more efficient and everything is using it and it is all tied together, it will be even more efficient and effective. So, you’re paying 40x earnings? In the next 5-10 years earnings will be 1000x what they are today for a company like NVIDIA. Ownership is almost priceless, there’s no “Bubble”, they’ve discovered the cure for cancer and everything else; if it were a pharmaceutical company, the stock would have been up 10,000x by now.",0,44,2025-10-10 14:41:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o32ro4/ai_is_not_in_a_bubble_or_is_it/,2025-11-07 16:43:31.501666,0.35,$T,0.8,[],"['bear', 'earnings', 'dip']",0.7171428571428571,Communication Services

The demand for chips is insatiable. * Data centers are expanding faster than ever * Computers are turning into AI companions * Robotaxis will become fully autonomous * Humanoid robots will be everywhere Each breakthrough in AI needs more computing power. And it’s just getting started. We’re still early in that phase. Even though there will be a crash in the coming 10 years—because AGI just isn’t possible yet and the AI race is essentially an arms race: the first to reach AGI owns everything. Once the market realizes AGI isn’t achievable anytime soon, there will be a crash. Until then, there’s still a vast middle ground of near- to mid-term possibilities where these products, while far from AGI, will still be epoch-defining inventions that create astronomical value—and a lot of money to be made.

Yes, the valuation is high, but quality growth rarely comes cheap. I see it as one of those companies that could keep compounding if you stay patient.

NTLA is close to the commercialization of their first in vivo treatment and it is clear they will need more funding (currently enough cash till first half 2027). It would seem logical that the management would now raise cash and play it safe funding-wise. But they haven’t. I believe this could be very bullish signal for investors. Why wait to raise if the share price is already up 3x? Possibly because they expect even more upside in the near term, most likely tied to the clinical data readouts expected later this year. If management is confident that data will significantly move the stock higher, it would make sense to delay a raise and capture a much better valuation later. On the other hand the capital raise could be announced anytime now or there could be some other reason for silence. But I believe big moves are on the horizon.

T,1obwk6s,financialindependence,Early-career crossroad: stay with a flexible consulting role or go all-in on a pre-IPO tech startup?,"Hi all, grateful for any thoughtful takes here. Context: I’m a pretty high-achieving person (or at least want to be). I’ve intentionally spent my 20s focused on financial and career progress... not much travel and rarely buy new things. My mid-term goal (next 10 years) is freedom: to never *have* to be always working, but to choose when and how I do. I want to be respected enough to work on projects I actually care about, and have the financial stability to say no when I need to. And then when I am working, not be working for someone else. I want to do 10am workout classes if I want, etc. I live simple regardless of money; outdoorsy, not a big consumer... and I’d feel “set” with about $1.5M in the bank at the end of the day (10-15 years from now). Not here to debate that number, there is so much more to it (family money incoming one day, etc), just sharing for context. **The situation:** I currently work for a very small consulting firm. My former leader brought me in as a sort-of informal partner... we split everything 60/40. The work is part-time due to lack of work (around 15–20 hours/week), and I’m not salaried, we just split all the work (I am VERY lucky, she is a great leader and the reason we have the good work we have is because of her). I’ll earn about $95K pre-tax this year (2025). On top of that, some assignments have potential upside, like commissions, that could be anywhere from $30K to $200K, depending on the outcome and timeline (could take 8 months to 2 years). So it’s not guaranteed, but the potential is *huge*. The work is flexible, meaningful, and I get a ton of autonomy. I am building my name and learning a lot. Basically my dream setup. But the pipeline of new work isn’t always consistent, and I’ve started wondering if I should be doing more to maximize my time and income. The other opportunity: About six months ago, a friend asked if I could help his tech company with events and operations. It’s not my main field, but I’m competent and said yes on a part-time basis. It pays $40/hr, remote, and informal (I’ve been wearing a lot of hats). At first I thought it was just side income, but the more I’ve learned about the company, the more interesting it’s become. It’s a well-known pre-IPO brand with real potential. If I leaned in, I think I could eventually earn equity or stock options. The downside: big startup energy. Long hours, high stress, constant pace. I am protected from this since I am not a full time employee right now, but if I went all-in, I’d lose a lot of the flexibility I currently have. **The decision:** Right now, I’m doing both. * **Job A (consulting):** life/work balance, flexible, uncertain upside but long-term dream life potential. * **Job B (tech startup):** high intensity, likely faster upside, more predictable path to big equity if it hits. I wouldn’t walk away from Job A unless I had equity *in writing*. But I keep questioning myself... am I being greedy by wanting more when I already have freedom most people dream of? Or lazy for not wanting to grind harder while I’m young (aka give up the flexibility), when the payoff could accelerate everything? **TL;DR:** Currently making \~$95K/yr working 15–20 hrs/week at a consulting firm with big upside potential but inconsistent work. Also doing part-time operations work for a pre-IPO tech company that could lead to equity but demands much more time.

T,1oqr0so,investing,Inflation Question I have been trying to wrap my head around,"Does inflation to the dollar automatically raise stock prices? Inflation isn’t the physical loss of your money. It’s the lowering of your ability to purchase the amount of the same product over time due to your money being considered less valuable. (While variable) Our government expects everyone to lose 2-4% of purchasing power each year. Case in point A person with 100,000$ in the 1800 was far wealthier than a person with a 1,000,000 dollars today. Do stocks not automatically rise in dollars per share because of the loss of consumer purchasing power like everything else does in dollars per item? Thank you for experiencing my Ted talk.

T,1oj64i1,investing,My dad (52) is exploring systematic options income to bridge to early retirement too risky or reasonable?,"I’ve been helping my dad think through his early retirement plan, and I wanted to get some outside perspective from people who’ve been there or done similar things. He’s 52 with around $780k saved and is hoping to retire at 56. The main issue is the 3.5-year gap before he can access his retirement accounts penalty-free. His dividend portfolio brings in about $22k a year, which isn’t quite enough to comfortably cover expenses during that bridge period. He’s been researching systematic options strategies mostly premium selling on indexes as a way to generate an additional 6–8% annually. The appeal is that it’s systematic and rules-based, not active trading. He likes the idea of using defined-risk spreads rather than naked positions. His biggest concern is volatility and drawdown risk. He’s not trying to gamble or turn retirement into a job just trying to enhance income safely enough to avoid needing to work another year. Bonds feel safer, but the yields don’t fully close the gap. So for those who’ve used options income as part of early-retirement planning: How do you think about allocation and risk control at this stage? Is a systematic index options approach realistic for generating steady supplemental income? Or is it better to just play it safe and work another year or two?

The company asked him to relay the message but didn’t reveal who they are. As I understand companies do this to avoid any collision once the chips go live. Intel used to sell x86 licenses in the 80s and then stopped. AMD still has one, and a few Chinese companies (like VIA/Zhaoxin/Hygon) have dormant ones. Looks like one of them might be waking up. I am not an expert in this field but it looks like there are quite a few Chinese companies still in possession of these licenses. Here are the ones I found so far: **Hygon / Haiguang (merged into Sugon’s server CPU line)** * Motivated to stay quiet internationally. * Actively building high-core-count, AI-capable x86 server CPUs for Chinese government / datacenter use. * Needs to carve out its own CPUID/MSR space and custom EVEX-encoded instructions. * Fits the AMD-lineage channel through Ludloff. **Zhaoxin (VIA + Shanghai)** * Legally x86, openly active in kernel/GCC. * Public ISA focus so far is AVX2-era, not (publicly) custom AI/tensor ops. * Historically not secretive. **Anyone else (VIA solo revival / Russian design / Western stealth startup)** * Very low probability given licensing, tooling, fab access, and zero supporting signals.",0,10,2025-10-27 18:48:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohmwd9/new_mystery_chipmaker_who_is_this/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.290133,0.35,$T,0.8,[],['support'],0.7057142857142856,Communication Services

T,1onegdq,ValueInvesting,$LRN just fell 50% and I doubled my position. Here’s why I think the market got this one dead wrong,"I wrote about $LRN a couple of months ago (www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1l3bv8l/stride\_inc\_lrn\_a\_quiet\_winner\_in\_online\_education/) please read that if you want more background about the company. $LRN crashed +50% after reporting what looked like a disappointing quarter. But when you peel back the headlines, the sell-off looks like pure short-term noise rather than a sign of deeper weakness. The big issue was a messy rollout of Stride’s new student platform. Technical glitches delayed enrollments, making it appear like demand fell off a cliff. But that’s misleading. Many Stride schools were actually oversubscribed, even running lotteries for limited seats. So the problem wasn’t demand, it was execution. That’s fixable. Then there’s guidance. Management basically hit the brakes, projecting only 5% revenue growth for FY2026. To me, that’s sandbagging. After years of rapid expansion, Stride’s leadership is clearly setting up an easy beat. Meanwhile, all the secular trends driving the business remain intact. Populations are booming in Stride’s key Sun Belt states (Texas, Florida, Arizona). School-choice programs are expanding across the U.S., making it easier for families to opt out of traditional schooling. And after the pandemic, digital learning is no longer fringe, it’s part of the mainstream education mix. Stride sits right in the middle of that shift, with career learning and online K–12 demand both trending upward. At today’s valuation the stock trades like the growth story has collapsed. I see the opposite: a temporary stumble, not a structural crack. Margins remain healthy, cash flow is solid, and the company’s model scales beautifully once enrollments normalize. I doubled my position because this looks like a textbook case of the market overreacting to short-term execution hiccups while ignoring long-term fundamentals. In a year or two, I expect sentiment to swing back sharply once growth resumes and the lowball guidance is reset. For anyone willing to stomach volatility, I think $LRN represents one of the best asymmetric risk/reward setups in the education sector today. A classic example of Mr. Market handing us a gift wrapped in panic.

When buying a rental house you don’t apply an exit multiple, when buying entire businesses you don’t apply an exit multiple, so why do it with stocks?

Sell CMA/Brokerage LTCG investments / collect dividend up to the 200% federal poverty level (yep, using ACA) 3. Using Roth contributions (if needed) Given I have a larger tIRA balance, I wanted to start tackling it now. It is likely I'll pay nearly 0% in federal taxes and the ACA subsidies should be good. Is this a valid / efficient approach? Second question - There could be a case where we take a year and go for lower ACA plan and/or reduce subsidies with a higher MAGI.

T,1o1woih,investing,When is it better to borrow against portfolio vs selling vs normal loan?,"I have been trying to research how to maximize investments and options and the one thing I feel I can’t quite get a grasp on is when to borrow against portfolio vs selling vs a “normal” bank loan. Where I am in understanding - selling your“portfolio” has taxes based on taxable income. So the more taxable income you have, the more the tax burden is on long term capital gains, up to a certain percentage (~37%). That said, borrowing against said portfolio comes with interest, slightly higher than a normal 30 yr, but without paying taxes on the sale. Either loan option though, your left paying interest vs cash up front. Question - how does it actually benefit you to borrow against your assets if you don’t have an income? Additionally, can I borrow and just default on the loan and “give up” the collateral? What benefit is it to borrow at a higher rate against my portfolio than a normal 30 yr fixed rate mortgage?",9,17,2025-10-09 04:25:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o1woih/when_is_it_better_to_borrow_against_portfolio_vs/,2025-11-07 16:43:31.506388,0.35,$T,0.8,[],[],0.7,Communication Services

T,1oe5j4j,ValueInvesting,Reaching FI felt amazing… until I saw how few real opportunities we actually have,"I’m 42 this year and just hit my first big FIRE milestone with around 10 million in net worth. It took years of patience and discipline. Like many people here, I went the classic route: maxing out retirement accounts, keeping expenses low, buying index funds, and letting time do the work. Almost all of my portfolio sits in public markets, and lately that feels a bit narrow. Every FIRE calculator, article, and plan seems to assume stocks and ETFs are the whole game and will go up forever. But a lot of the companies,when we talk about daily are actually private. And by the time we get access to invest into them majority of the growth is already done. I understand why private investments are seen as risky and illiquid. That’s fair. But it’s interesting how financial independence often just means relying on the same limited asset classes. We talk a lot about diversification, yet the options most of us have are still pretty narrow. Has anyone here tried adding a small portion of private or alternative investments into their FIRE strategy? Does it actually help with diversification or end up being just hype? Edit: Thanks for all the thoughtful replies.A lot of people shared their experiences and mentioned different platforms along the way, including Republic, StartEngine, EquityZen, and Jarsy. What stood out to me wasn’t any single platform, but the fact that several of them seem to make it easier for people to participate with smaller amounts.

T,1o8tsey,financialindependence,DF Optional FI calculator - Feedback requested,"Hey all, I'd love for you to take a look at a calculator I built and let me know if you find it useful and if there are any issues. **Background:** I've never been much of a FIRE person myself. On the whole I've stayed away from sacrificing my now for a nebulous potential future. I did what I considered responsible (401(k) matching, etc), but didn't make big bets. But I'm also a big proponent for knowing when is ""enough"". I recently did the math, and discovered that ""enough"" was a lot closer than I expected. I'm 38, and from what I'm seeing retirement at age 45 as difficult but achievable, while retirement at 50 is a no-brainer. That's assuming the standard 7% nominal growth, 4% SWR, etc. and also comfortable with returning to the workforce to fund my excess and so on. I'm not aiming to fully stop working, I just want to no longer be \_coerced\_ to work. **The tool:** Part of ""doing the math"" meant building out a good Desmos calculator to find when my savings growth was likely to hit my savings targets. So that's what I built and that's what I'm asking y'all to take a look at. I've done what I can to validate the underlying math (both using my own education as well as leveraging some AI tools to check my math). But there's no substitute for more eyeballs. The tool shows 3 targets, all in real dollars (i.e. adjusted for inflation): * **The Fat target:** Treats mortgage as part of normal expenses (i.e., portfolio covers P&I and PTI via withdrawals). * **The Lean/Debt-free target:** Discounts expenses by the mortgage P&I, assuming the home is fully paid off. * **The Hybrid target (the one I'm targeting):** The debt-free target + the remaining principal on the mortgage (discounted for inflation). This is the target where you *could* pay off the mortgage and still cover all expenses, but allows you to keep arbitrage between your investments and the mortgage. The tool allows for a ""coast"" period, where no further savings contributions are made, but no withdrawal is made either. **Nitty details:** * ~~Tax drag on withdrawals isn’t explicitly modeled here and would be covered under “expenses.”~~ Edit: a term for this has been added. * This is all estimates, so fine-grained detail isn’t the goal. That’s why specific tax liability was left out. But anything that would cause it to scale differently should be called out. * This is intended to give an overall timeline, not determine whether you're currently \_at\_ a phase transition point. This expects that it's a long enough timeline for highs and lows to cancel out, but for actually making the jump you need to be prepared for things like sequence of returns risk. It *can* be useful for figuring out if you're close enough that you should start preparing, though (e.g. by starting the Roth Conversion Ladder if that's part of your tax strategy). **The request:** Please poke holes in this. I did my best to document what each variable means, but I might be using some nonstandard notation. The formulas will be close to textbook form, but might have common factors cancelled out and simplified. Double check that the formulas I'm using are sound and appropriate for their use. At this point I don't think it's safe to use until folks have properly reviewed it, but if it checks out I think it's something people might find useful. For me, personally, knowing the number I needed to save caused my eyes to glaze over. But seeing ""8 years"" made it more real for me. Note: in the link I'm providing I've obscured my actual numbers, so don't take this as an analysis of my actual situation. Original: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6brcerquy6](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6brcerquy6) Edited: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/suc6nuy9zr](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/suc6nuy9zr) * Cleaned up some of the slider ranges and added a few extra notes. * Added labels to target lines. * Added t\_eff for the effective tax rate of withdrawals, with a default value of 15%. F\_F and F\_DF now include a term of (1 - t\_eff) in their denominator (this also impacts F\_H). This adjusts the target portfolio size upward to account for tax drag.",1,6,2025-10-17 06:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1o8tsey/df_optional_fi_calculator_feedback_requested/,2025-11-07 16:44:36.091619,0.35,$T,0.5,[],[],0.7,Communication Services
T,1ojpu1z,ValueInvesting,SMPL huge opportunity on a market overreaction,"TLDR: SMPL bullish as hell. They own Quest, OWYN, and Atkins brands of diet/health food. Stock is down big on a market overreaction to most recent ER. Company reported a paper loss of .12, but it’s all an accounting thing. They would have reported a profit of .45 or so, but they reassessed the value of their Atkins brand to be $60m lower than they were currently valuing it on the books. Revenue is in line, operating costs are in line mostly, marketing was a 9m savings over PY and they would have made 45m or so in profit if they didn’t assess down by 60m on the brands value for a 15m or so loss. OK, so I’m a degenerate and I was scrolling the 52 week new lows list looking for penny stock runners (if you haven’t noticed, every 150% top daily gainer this month has hit a 52 week low a few days prior). Anyways I scroll past this stock SMPL that is new to me, trading near $20. Ok I’m intrigued. So I check the chart and it’s decent, with a big drop in the past few days. Ok, what’s that. ER miss. Ok. What do they do? HOLY SHIT ITS QUEST BARS. Ok ok slow down. Check the financials and I’m surprised to see a healthy company on fundamental levels. Good earnings, profitable, healthy debt to assets, and just one big miss this quarter. Interesting, I wonder what happened so I go to the P&L and run down it quick. Healthy revenue, healthy cost of goods, 9m in saving YOY in marketing costs, good gross profit, and a single $60m charge for impairments. Weird. So I dig deeper a bit into their latest 10k to see what that is, and it’s a paper cost for a lowered asset valuation on Atkins, so their 45m or so in profit turns to a 15m loss, because accounting stuff. Alright the market overreacted to a paper loss when the normal business is solid as hell. I’m in for $50k. Obligatory gpt summary for folks who can read good: 🧾 Summary Simply Good Foods (SMPL) reported a Q4 GAAP loss per share of $0.12, but this is entirely due to a one-time, non-cash impairment of about $60 million tied to re-valuing the Atkins brand and other intangible assets. This was an accounting adjustment, not a reflection of declining revenue or rising costs. The company’s operating performance remained consistent — sales and margins were close to prior periods, and adjusted EPS came in positive at $0.46. In plain terms: SMPL didn’t lose $60 million — it re-marked down the book value of an older brand to reflect updated market assumptions. The underlying business still produced roughly its usual profit. 🧠 Takeaway • The $60 million impairment is a paper loss, not cash out the door. • It reflects a revaluation of the Atkins brand, not weakness in the company’s day-to-day operations. • Without that charge, SMPL would have shown a profitable quarter similar to historical norms. • The stock’s sell-off likely overreacts to an accounting headline rather than a real earnings deterioration. Position: I’m in for $50k in shares and $1000 in options so far. Screenshots in comments. This one’s gonna be a banger. Should be worth $25-30 or more in my opinion, and OWYN brand (allergen free protein shakes and powder) is a huge growth opportunity.

T,1ols11h,ValueInvesting,[DD] ASP Isotopes (ASPI) — Building a $300M EBITDA Isotope Powerhouse,"ASP Isotopes (NASDAQ: ASPI) is quietly evolving into a **vertically integrated isotope and quantum materials company**. Management’s *base case* targets **$300M in EBITDA by 2030**, *excluding* any contribution from nuclear fuel, HALEU, or waste remediation. The story isn’t about uranium hype — it’s about execution. Three operational “flywheels” are spinning up right now: **1. Silicon-28** – early quantum & semiconductor revenue engine **2.** **Medical Isotopes** – scalable healthcare products feeding Lu-177 & Tb-161 therapies **3. Low-Cost + Vertical Integration** – Iceland plants + PET Labs pharmacies = high-margin moat If even half the plan materializes, upside could still be 50%+ from current levels. **Management Case Overview** # 🎯 Target * **$300M consolidated EBITDA by 2030** * *Excludes*: QLE, HALEU, uranium enrichment, waste-to-value business * Based purely on the **isotope segment** The roadmap is credible, because each segment can stand alone — but they reinforce one another when scaled together (2026–2029). # ⚙️ Flywheel #1 — Silicon-28: The Quantum Catalyst ASPI is the **world’s only commercial supplier of enriched Silicon-28 (Si-28)** — a material that drastically improves semiconductor and quantum computing performance. **Why it matters:** * Si-28 has 150% higher thermal conductivity * Reduces decoherence in quantum processors * Used in solid-state quantum computing & advanced semiconductors **Execution goals (2026–2027):** * Deliver kilogram-scale volumes *on time and on spec* * Publish 3rd-party purity validation * Convert at least 1 initial contract into a larger follow-on + win a 2nd marquee customer Once that credibility is earned, scaling becomes the driver. Each new Iceland module lowers energy cost per unit and boosts margin. If Si-28 production hits **20–30 kg/year by 2030**, revenues alone sit comfortably in the **nine-figure range**, with high margins. # 💉 Flywheel #2 — Medical Isotopes: The Healthcare Engine ASPI’s medical isotope platform targets **radiotherapeutics and diagnostics** — a fast-growing $10B+ global market. **Primary therapy driver:** * **Ytterbium-176 → Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)**, used in prostate & neuroendocrine cancer treatment **Other isotopes enable diversification and stable base sales:** * **Nickel-64 → Copper-64** (PET diagnostics) * **Gadolinium-160 → Terbium-161** (next-gen therapy isotope) * **Zinc-68 → Gallium-68 / Copper-67** (diagnostics) No single product carries the segment — the strategy is to keep enrichment lines fully utilized while one therapy product scales to commercial levels. **Targets:** * Commission new enrichment lines (2025–2026) * Convert LOIs into take-or-pay contracts * Pass first GMP & regulatory audits If one therapy isotope (e.g., Tb-161 or Lu-177) scales, and 2–3 diagnostics reach steady multi-million revenue, the medical segment could **match or exceed Si-28 by decade-end**. # ⚡ Flywheel #3 — Cost Advantage & Integration This is ASPI’s structural moat. Their **Iceland facilities** have access to geothermal and hydro energy at **1/5th to 1/7th the global average cost** — and electricity is the #1 cost input for isotope enrichment. **Advantages:** * Persistent cost leadership * Flexible allocation between isotope lines * Resilience during pricing shifts Meanwhile, **PET Labs** (ASPI’s radiopharmacy division) creates **vertical integration**: Enriched isotopes → converted into medical doses → directly sold to hospitals. That adds downstream margin and smooths revenue volatility. **Execution steps:** * Get first Iceland module live by mid-2026 * Add new modules steadily through 2029 * Acquire 1–2 additional pharmacies to scale the PET Labs template Goal: **40–50% EBITDA margins** at the pharmacy level as internal isotope sourcing increases. # Putting It Together |Segment|EBITDA Potential by 2030|Key Drivers| |:-|:-|:-| || |Silicon-28|$100–150M|Volume, purity, 2nd customer| |Medical isotopes|$100–150M|Therapy adoption + diagnostics| |Cost & integration|$50M+|Iceland scale, PET Labs, efficiency| |**Total (ex-QLE)**|**\~$300M EBITDA**|Achievable through 2029| No value is assigned to: * QLE (uranium fuel & HALEU) * Waste remediation (One 30 Seven) * Future nuclear fuel partnerships So this $300M case is **purely isotopes**. **Valuation Sensitivity** If *only 50%* of the $300M EBITDA plan is achieved: * EV/EBITDA = 10× → \~**+50% upside** vs current levels * IRR ≈ **8%** (conservative case) Management calls their plan *“100–200% conservative”*, so this should be viewed as a **floor, not a ceiling**.",0,1,2025-11-01 16:23:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ols11h/dd_asp_isotopes_aspi_building_a_300m_ebitda/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.872719,0.35,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'volume', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.6228571428571429,Communication Services
T,1omqgct,investing,under the radar potential gene editing powerhouse: Precision Biosciences,"I've been deep into gene editing companies for a number of years, and I keep coming back to Precision BioSciences. While everyone's obsessed with CRISPR, they've built something fundamentally different called ARCUS that could revolutionize how we treat genetic diseases. Think about it: for thousands of conditions, we've known exactly what's broken in the DNA for decades, but we couldn't fix it. We just managed symptoms. Gene editing changes everything. It's molecular surgery on your genome. Cut out the bad code, insert working replacements, delete problematic sections. The first CRISPR therapy got approved in 2023 for sickle cell disease, which proved the concept works. But here's what most people miss: CRISPR has real limitations. It makes messy cuts, it's huge (which makes delivery a nightmare), and you can't always control how the cell repairs the damage. For critical organs like the liver and heart where precision matters most, these limitations are a serious problem. ARCUS takes a completely different approach. Instead of repurposing a bacterial immune system protein like CRISPR does, it's based on an enzyme from algae that evolved over millions of years specifically to insert genes with precision. That evolutionary history matters because nature doesn't mess around. The enzyme had to be incredibly selective or it would've killed the organism. ARCUS makes a specific type of cut called a 3' overhang that naturally guides the cell toward high-fidelity repair, the kind you need for inserting therapeutic genes. Even better, ARCUS is only one-third the size of CRISPR's Cas9, which solves the massive delivery bottleneck. You can fit everything you need into a single AAV vector: the editor, all the regulatory elements, and a complete repair template. CRISPR literally can't do this because it's too big. And ARCUS is just one self-contained protein, not two separate components that have to find each other and assemble correctly inside the cell. It's elegant, it's precise, and it works. Earlier this year they already cured a baby with a devastating liver disease called OTC deficiency. This kid would've died or needed a liver transplant. Instead, they injected ARCUS packaged in a virus, it went to the liver, inserted a working copy of the missing gene, and now 18 months later the baby is completely normal. Eating regular food, no medications, developing on track. And that 18-month durability is the key data point because infant livers grow rapidly. If the gene wasn't permanently integrated into the chromosomes, the therapeutic effect would've faded as cells divided. It didn't. The gene is in there, stable, working. No other gene editing company has demonstrated durable in vivo gene insertion in humans. The approved CRISPR therapies are all ex vivo, meaning they take your cells out, edit them in a lab, and put them back. Precision is doing this inside the body, which scales to way more diseases. Now they've got two massive programs. First is hepatitis B, which affects over 300 million people globally. Current drugs suppress the virus but almost never cure it because they don't touch the viral DNA reservoirs hiding in liver cells. ARCUS uses two enzymes packaged together to physically cut out and destroy both reservoirs. Their Phase 1/2 trial showed patients getting 47%, 60%, and 69% reductions in the viral marker, and one patient has held a 50% reduction for seven months. That sustained durability suggests they're actually eliminating the virus, not just suppressing it. If higher doses can push that to complete clearance and let patients stop daily antivirals, you're talking about a functional cure for a disease that kills a million people annually. The market for this is estimated at $10 billion in the US alone. Second program is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the devastating muscle disease that puts boys in wheelchairs by their teens and kills them in their twenties. Their approach cuts out the broken section of the dystrophin gene and reconnects it in-frame, producing nearly full-length functional protein. The kicker is they're editing the muscle stem cells, which means as the kid grows and muscles regenerate throughout life, all the new muscle fibers will have the correction. Existing gene therapies can't do this. The preclinical data showed mice with sustained improvements in muscle function for nine months, and they're filing to start human trials in 2025.

The pipeline is absolutely banging, and the science is super compelling. The valuation disconnect is absolutely wild. Precision's market cap is around $100 million, which is actually less than the cash on their balance sheet. The market is pricing in near-certain failure. But if the hepatitis B program hits functional cure rates of 20% to 30% with good safety, and the Duchenne program shows meaningful dystrophin restoration and functional improvements in kids, you're looking at programs that could each do $2 to $4 billion in peak sales. Model that out with standard biotech multiples and discount for clinical risk, and you get to $10 billion pretty easily. Maybe more if a pharma giant like Gilead decides they want to own the hepatitis B cure outright. The risk is real because clinical trials fail all the time, but the asymmetry here is insane. The downside is largely priced in, and the upside if this works is 100x from here. I'm watching every data readout on this one because if ARCUS delivers, this could be one of the defining gene editing companies of the next decade.",0,4,2025-11-02 19:31:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1omqgct/under_the_radar_potential_gene_editing_powerhouse/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.270844,0.35,$T,0.8,[],"['puts', 'rally', 'market cap']",0.6171428571428571,Communication Services

T,1o61ebg,ValueInvesting,"Assessing Management Quality: Beyond Vibes, Handshakes, and Governance Checklists","Buffett has always said that management's skill in allocating capital has an enormous impact on enterprise value. Greenblatt put it even more simply: if management has been a good allocator of capital, assume they'll keep doing that. Yet when I look at how most investors actually evaluate management, it's still governance checklists and gut feel from a couple meetings per year. It's subjective, hard to scale, and honestly not that useful. I've spent the last few years trying to build something more systematic. Here's what I've landed on: **1. Capital Allocation Discipline** Don't just look at whether the ROIC was good. Look at what management said when they made the decision. What opportunities did they see? What trade-offs did they talk about? What did they say success would look like? This tells you about their judgment before you know the outcome. And when you track this over multiple decisions, patterns become obvious. Some teams have a real framework. Others are just winging it and cleaning up the story later. **2. Forecasting Accuracy** Everyone analyzes official guidance. That's commoditized. The signal is in the operational stuff executives say in calls and presentations. ""We expect production volumes to hit X by Q3."" ""Customer adoption is tracking ahead of plan."" ""The regulatory approval should come through in the next 60 days."" They make these statements all the time, and they're way less hedged than the official numbers. Track whether they actually deliver on them. Some management teams consistently hit what they say. Others are constantly revising. There's research on this (Baik, Farber, and Lee 2011) showing that managers who forecast accurately actually run better businesses and their stocks outperform. **3. Strategic Execution** Talk is cheap. Everyone has a strategy. The question is whether they actually deliver on it. Track the initiatives they announce. New products. Market expansions. Cost savings programs. Whatever they're telling investors they're going to do. Then track whether they actually do it on the timeline they said. Persistent slippage tells you something about planning and organizational capability. Some teams consistently deliver. Others consistently don't. Kaplan's research found execution skills are one of the most predictive traits for returns. Makes sense when you think about it. **4. Communication Transparency** Watch how management communicates when things go well versus when they don't. Does the story change every quarter to match the results? Or is the messaging pretty consistent? Good teams tell you what's working and what's not. They explain variances clearly. Bad teams spin everything. Good quarters are because of brilliant strategy. Bad quarters are because of external factors nobody could have predicted. You can feel this when you read transcripts over time. Some CEOs just sound more credible than others. The trick is measuring it systematically instead of relying on feel. **Why This Actually Matters** The academic work here is pretty clear. Bertrand and Schoar showed back in 2003 that individual managers leave persistent fingerprints on how companies operate. More recent work (Bennedsen 2020) shows managerial ability explains a huge chunk of performance differences, even after you control for industry and everything else. Two companies with identical balance sheets can produce completely different returns based on who's running them. Yet management evaluation is still one of the least systematic parts of most investment processes. The hard part is moving from ""I got a good vibe from the CEO"" to actual data you can point to. **What I'm Not Including** Governance checklists are fine but they're table stakes. Everyone has independent boards and compensation committees. That doesn't tell you who's actually good at capital allocation. And I've learned not to trust my impressions from meetings. You see a CEO maybe six times a year if you're lucky. That's not enough data to judge someone. Plus you're probably just reacting to how polished their presentation is, which tells you nothing about judgment. **Looking for Feedback** I'd love to hear from folks here: * What am I missing in this framework? * How do you evaluate management today? * What patterns have you noticed in your own holdings about what separates good management from bad? I wrote up the full framework with all the research and details here: [https://www.marvin-labs.com/blog/evaluating-management-quality/](https://www.marvin-labs.com/blog/evaluating-management-quality/)",5,4,2025-10-14 00:43:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o61ebg/assessing_management_quality_beyond_vibes/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.891971,0.35,$T,0.6,[],"['calls', 'volume']",0.6114285714285714,Communication Services
T,1o4iq4i,ValueInvesting,Please criticize my Investment Thesis on Slide,"Maybe you will change my mind and save my money or I will change yours and make you money. Slide is a young Florida based home insurer (founded 2022) focusing on coastal properties which is a niche most large insurers have abandoned due to high hurricane and regulatory risk (Assignement of Benefit and one-way fees in courts, I can expand on this in the comments). They’re leveraging proprietary risk-modelling tech and data-driven underwriting to profitably insure where others won’t. The good: • Massive market opportunity: Citizens (state-backed insurer) is offloading policies, and looks like Slide is cherry-picking the most profitable ones so far (190k expected in 2025). Citizens sold 678k policies since January 2024 and have 772k outstanding yet to sell as of August 2025, so looks like this can last roughly 2 more years. • Rapid growth: revenue jumped from $242M in 2022 → $847M in 2024 while cutting the combined ratio from 90% → 79% → 72%, far below peers like HCI (83%) and Heritage (94%). • Structural tailwind: Florida’s post-2022 regulatory clean-up fixed issues like “assignment of benefit” abuse that bankrupted 11 insurers in 5 years before 2022 which makes Slide benefit from first mover advantage. The bad / risks: • Very young company (although the founder-CEO was a co-founder and CEO of Heritage Insurance before) • CEO and wife control over 51% of shares and 45% of votes which could create investor-management conflicts of interest. • 145 BBB complaints in 3 years and 82 in the last 12 months~10x higher than competition, so could be possible that their combined ratio is from aggressive claims handling and not from some wonderful modelling capabilities. • Sensitive to reinsurance pricing spikes after hurricanes (industry specific risk, not company specific) Valuation methodology I used: DCF with perpetuity 2% (Assumption for FCF increasing in line with inflation at mature state of the company) For revenue growth and FCF margin as of percentage of Revenue I used: 20% and 62% for 2026, 15% and 60% for 2027, 11% and 58% for 2028. Then I used 5% FCF growth for 7 more years to get 10 year forecast in total before applying perpetuity.

Our market has only 11 companies in the MSCI Philippines Index mostly in old sectors like banking and industrials. There’s barely any IPO activity, and even profitable firms see their shares fall because foreign investors have simply stopped paying attention. Our exchange chief said it best: “What is the most important ingredient in the stock market? Confidence.

No. Will they go away anytime soon? Also no. Even if the AI trend slows down, these companies still have strong foundations and cash flow from their non-AI products. During the dot com bubble, most companies had no profits and were running on hype alone. Not to mention how technology wasn’t even a big part of people’s lives back then.

T,1o6fxae,investing,How I learned that efficiency can matter more than growth,"Over the past couple of years, I’ve started to realize that growth on its own doesn’t mean much if the foundation isn’t solid. I work at a company with around 300 employees, and last year things started to fall apart a bit not because revenue was down, but because operations were messy. We had too many tools, overlapping software subscriptions, and no clear view of where the money was actually going. It was frustrating because on paper everything looked good, but cash flow always felt tight. Projects got delayed, invoices went missing, and departments started pointing fingers. Eventually we had to slow down, take a step back, and focus on structure instead of expansion. We started tracking spending more closely, consolidating systems, and making accountability a daily habit. It’s not as exciting as talking about returns or stock picks, but that shift completely changed how I think about investing too. I used to focus on finding the next opportunity now I’m more interested in how efficiently each dollar is being used. Efficiency quietly compounds the same way returns do.",220,14,2025-10-14 13:45:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1o6fxae/how_i_learned_that_efficiency_can_matter_more/,2025-11-07 16:43:31.493140,0.3,$T,0.8,[],['revenue'],1.0,Communication Services
T,1o3y904,investing,When Your Investments Outperform Your Salary: Staying Motivated at Work,"I’ve been thinking about something lately and wanted to share it here, maybe some of you can relate. I’ve noticed that my motivation at work has dropped since my investments, mainly in ETFs and stocks, started performing better than my monthly salary. For example, if I earn around €3,000 a month, but my portfolio grows by €6,000 in the same period, it’s natural to feel more excited about that growth than about my paycheck. At the same time, I catch myself constantly checking market updates on my phone during the day. Since I invest regularly, I often open my investment apps to see how things are going which definitely distracts me from my work. Of course, I know that a stable salary is essential for everyday life paying rent, bills, and living expenses. Still, I can’t help but feel that when investment returns outpace my income, it becomes harder to stay motivated at my job. I also realize this view is somewhat biased. When the markets are strong, it’s easy to focus on the gains and feel less excited about work. But during downturns, I naturally appreciate the security of my regular paycheck more. It’s a cycle. Yet in a bull market, my attention and energy tend to shift toward my investments. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

T,1oqykm9,wallstreetbets,No crying in the casino,I’m 21 I been in this community for a while know never been through more ups and downs then ever since I joined. The subreddit helped me cope with my losses and appreciated my gains but overall I’ll be honest I’m lost in life. I got into options ever since I looked up to other people making a side income and saying this is very good skill to get into so I decided to enter in the game not knowing the risk to options. I deposited my first 2.4K into Rh getting into penny stocks and as they say the first one is free I doubled the returns and kept getting addicted more and more and put literally everyone I know on trading so much so that my friend who I use to call a friend but know is a cocky individual is making $2-4k on options and hit a big trade yesterday making 200k of Tesla puts since he started trading. Anyways I’m 21 know I’m starting college next month to take new steps at life but I keep getting demotivated everyday feels like pain and suffering I fuckin hate wallstreet so much when I lost 20k I called ICE and asked how to get my refund 😂 like a idiot. For anyone wondering why I waited so long to start is because for 2 years know I been trying to get a job applying to literally any place no one wants to hire me at all no airport job city jobs just dead end places paying 18$ a hour is this the American struggle I was born and raised in NYC as the capital of finance you would expect alittle decency but no nothing. I’m currently rolling in an online buisness degree where they pay for college and give me TAP money which I’m not going to gamble but rather save for something. The way I lost my 20k was earnings on NVIDIA lesson learned unfortunately didn’t realize how dumb I was for playing it. Aside from that hopefully if I graduate and transfer I get into a good job and the job market cools down the only people winning is the ones who have a lot of capital and rich people which there is nothing wrong with I believe everyone should win and enjoy the fruits in the garden. Today I lost from being to greedy I was making steady 800 everyday full porting chasing loses I was up nicely this week until I crushed myself today this isn’t good for my mental health and seeing others win large amounts only fuels the fire. This is why discipline and patience is a key to the game of options and having a STOP LOSS guys don’t make the same mistakes as me. I love you guys this is my last time on this sub Reddit before I start school for fall i appreciate everyone and I’m sure no one has loss like me Goodbye 💔,68,34,2025-11-07 16:12:53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqykm9,2025-11-07 16:42:40.519450,0.3,$T,1.0,[],"['puts', 'earnings', 'rally', 'loss', 'eps']",0.9285714285714285,Communication Services

Basically, the market’s showing that fundamentals are what really drive stock moves right now. To back this up, they used a model looking at things like free cash flow yield, ROE, and new orders to estimate the chances of big moves. The results suggest the market might be underestimating potential swings, both up and down. They also highlighted 25 specific opportunities—20 bullish names like Disney, Citi, Broadcom, Microchip, and 5 bearish ones like MGM, Enphase, AMD. Goldman points out that the mispricing in options could create opportunities, but it’s risky and speculative, and not for someone who doesn’t understand options. The main takeaway? Long-term investing still comes down to fundamentals.

Despite that, their ad revenue continues to climb, showing that TikTok hasn’t been nearly as disruptive as many expected at the start of 2025 when its U.S. ban looked uncertain. Threads is also proving to be a major success, now surpassing Elon’s X in monthly active users. That creates yet another ad channel within Meta’s ecosystem—one that can be monetized at scale with minimal additional cost. Beyond ads, Meta is moving into retail hardware, starting with the well-received Meta Glasses. With their heavy AR investment and growing consumer trust, Meta looks positioned to be the first company to deliver a true smart-glasses experience capable of powering a fully AR workspace. Entering this segment could open a high-margin revenue stream far beyond social media. And despite all of this growth, Meta is still trading roughly 18% below its all-time high, while most of the other “Magnificent Seven” tech giants are sitting within about 3–8% of their peaks.",139,195,2025-11-02 02:07:00,https://i.redd.it/hso0jhpz4ryf1.jpeg,2025-11-07 16:42:40.539930,0.3,$T,1.0,['META'],"['revenue', 'eps']",0.9114285714285714,Communication Services
T,1oqyw0x,stocks,"Meta is earning a fortune on a deluge of fraudulent ads, documents show","Meta internally projected late last year that it would earn about 10% of its overall annual revenue – or $16 billion – from running advertising for scams and banned goods, internal company documents show. A cache of previously unreported documents reviewed by Reuters also shows that the social-media giant for at least three years failed to identify and stop an avalanche of ads that exposed Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp’s billions of users to fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos, and the sale of banned medical products. On average, one December 2024 document notes, the company shows its platforms’ users an estimated 15 billion “higher risk” scam advertisements – those that show clear signs of being fraudulent – every day. Meta earns about $7 billion in annualized revenue from this category of scam ads each year, another late 2024 document states. Much of the fraud came from marketers acting suspiciously enough to be flagged by Meta’s internal warning systems. But the company only bans advertisers if its automated systems predict the marketers are at least 95% certain to be committing fraud, the documents show. If the company is less certain – but still believes the advertiser is a likely scammer – Meta charges higher ad rates as a penalty, according to the documents. The idea is to dissuade suspect advertisers from placing ads. The documents further note that users who click on scam ads are likely to see more of them because of Meta’s ad-personalization system, which tries to deliver ads based on a user’s interests. The details of Meta’s confidential self-appraisal are drawn from documents created between 2021 and this year across Meta’s finance, lobbying, engineering and safety divisions. Together, they reflect Meta’s efforts to quantify the scale of abuse on its platforms – and the company’s hesitancy to crack down in ways that could harm its business interests. Meta’s acceptance of revenue from sources it suspects are committing fraud highlights the lack of regulatory oversight of the advertising industry, said Sandeep Abraham, a fraud examiner and former Meta safety investigator who now runs a consultancy called Risky Business Solutions. “If regulators wouldn’t tolerate banks profiting from fraud, they shouldn’t tolerate it in tech,” he told Reuters. In a statement, Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the documents seen by Reuters “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams.” The company’s internal estimate that it would earn 10.1% of its 2024 revenue from scams and other prohibited ads was “rough and overly-inclusive,” Stone said. The company had later determined that the true number was lower, because the estimate included “many” legitimate ads as well, he said. He declined to provide an updated figure. “The assessment was done to validate our planned integrity investments – including in combatting frauds and scams – which we did,” Stone said. He added: “We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it and we don’t want it either.” ""Over the past 18 months, we have reduced user reports of scam ads globally by 58 percent and, so far in 2025, we’ve removed more than 134 million pieces of scam ad content,” Stone said. Some of the documents show Meta vowing to do more. ""We have large goals to reduce ad scams in 2025,"" states a 2024 document, with Meta hoping to reduce such ads in certain markets by as much as 50%. In other places, documents show managers congratulating staffers for successful scam reduction efforts.

T,1o7177q,stocks,Apple is the Weakest Mag 7 Stock,"Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company. For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. I also want to say that I think Apple is a great company. I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade. Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). Their moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone. But their moat is not actively growing. I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason. The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024. iPad: $26.69 B iPhone: $201.18 B Mac: $29.98 B Service: $96.17 B Wearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B (2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment Doing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone. That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV). iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful. Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim. It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary. In the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to. I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. TLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone Edit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.

This isn’t to say they don’t have the potential for the stock to tank all of a sudden, but I believe in all of these quite strongly. **TLDR:** Basically I want to know which companies you believe in the most for growth and capital gains over the next several years",290,497,2025-10-24 15:48:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1of1b9v/what_is_your_highest_conviction_growth_stock/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.297753,0.3,$T,0.8,[],['rocket'],0.9057142857142856,Communication Services

T,1od9vbw,investing,Best way to transfer a large sum internationally for property or investment purposes?,"Edit: Thanks for the insights! After comparing options, I tried [Xe](https://openreddit.link/xe-personal-link) for my international investment transfer. Being able to see the exchange rate upfront before committing gave me peace of mind, and their fees were significantly lower than my bank’s. I was hesitant at first given the size of the transfer, but the process was straightforward and the funds arrived on time. Glad I explored alternatives instead of defaulting to the bank. Question for those who have moved large amounts of money abroad for property purchases, investment accounts, or international assets: how did you do it? Banks are the default, but their fees and poor exchange rates on big transfers add up quickly, even a small percentage difference can mean thousands lost. At the same time, it feels risky to trust smaller services when the amounts aren’t small. Has anyone found safe alternatives for large international transfers that work better than traditional banks? Real experiences would be especially helpful.",125,133,2025-10-22 14:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1od9vbw/best_way_to_transfer_a_large_sum_internationally/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.304914,0.3,$T,0.8,[],[],0.8999999999999999,Communication Services

Good news is that I think when I wrap this up, we should be good on money. House is already paid for. College is taken care of. No debt at all. Without getting into specifics, we have in the range of $6MM in general investments and $2.5MM in 401(k)/IRA. I haven’t had leisure time since I was probably 17 years old. I don’t have any practice at being productive while not working. I have to have something to do every day. I am not wired to sit around and relax.

T,1okxc49,ValueInvesting,Bubble talk,"FYI I’m not a “doomer”. I think we’re in a great strong bull run that will eventually come to an end. I just want to make a lot of money on a correction if and when that happens. I’ve been doing a lot of research into trying to understand roughly when we can expect a top in this market and then a crash. All my research focuses on two things being needed for a proper 1-3 year bear market to happen. 1st, Fed increasing rates and 2nd extreme amounts of margin debt. The Fed is cutting rates at the moment and the orange haired man will surly swap Powell out with someone that will cut further which is great for the short term. But I’m predicting inflation will increase in a big way some time next year and the only option will be to increase rates. In my opinion this will be a major sign a top. My question is what are “extreme” levels of margin debt? Before the great depression crash margin debt was 8.4% of gdp, before the dotcom crash and the 2008 crash it was 3% of gdp. As of September 2025 we are at 3.86% of gdp and have been increasing each month by 0.2%. I’ve heard from experts that this margin debt isn’t at extreme levels but I’m wondering what is extreme levels in your opinion?",15,38,2025-10-31 15:16:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1okxc49/bubble_talk/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.882638,0.3,$T,0.6,[],"['bull', 'bear']",0.8114285714285714,Communication Services

T,1o24wzd,financialindependence,Check my understanding: 401k to Roth IRA rollover,"I’ve read up a bunch but want to put it all in one post to verify because this is always a little more complicated than the standard advice for people below the wage limits. Context: - I am a high earner and will be for the next 3 years. - I will then work a much lower income job to be barista/coast fire. No withdrawals from any accounts. - I have 1 large 401k and 3 smaller 401ks from past jobs. (I have brokerage accounts, unrelated to this situation) Am I correct: - I can rollover the old 401ks to a Roth IRA without doing a backdoor Roth in this situation - There is no limit to the amount i can rollover unlike normal annual contributions to an IRA - This is a taxable event (pre tax to after tax) - Therefore I should wait to rollover until I move to that lower income job in 3-4 years and my tax rate is lower. - The 5-year rule applies. I will be 55 at that point. - There is no limit to what i can withdraw at 5 years except the amount i contributed. I wouldn’t plan to withdraw it all but just thinking ahead for all situations.

T,1oqm7rk,ValueInvesting,The narrative that AI isn’t profitable is WRONG,"I think it’s important to correct this because this narrative is causing many to shy away from investing in AI. Most cherry pick companies to support the narrative that AI isn’t profitable with OpenAI being the poster child for this. However, there’s little to no mention of companies that have driven a massive surge in revenues, earnings, free cash flow, operating margins, etc due DIRECTLY to the development of AI. I’ll give one example of such a company: APPLOVIN. Applovin has created an AI ad placement optimizer called Axon 2. Axon 2 is so effective in ad placement that the company’s revenue has grown 69% YoY in its recent report with a profit margin of 59.5%. Using rule of 40, you combine these 2 metrics to evaluate the health of SaaS companies. Applovin stands at 129 which is even higher than Palantir at 91. Applovins recent success would not have been possible without the development of AI. They are just one example of a company using AI to make HUGE MONEY. So yes, AI is VERY PROFITABLE. Be selective when picking your stocks. There are winners and losers. To say that AI isn’t making companies a profit is just totally false.",0,19,2025-11-07 05:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oqm7rk/the_narrative_that_ai_isnt_profitable_is_wrong/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.831662,0.3,$T,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7228571428571429,Communication Services

T,1ojoqgn,ValueInvesting,Interdigital (IDCC) Earnings Call Tomorrow Morning... Any input is greatly appreciated,"I'm a 19-year-old, pretty beginner investor in college, just learning how to use screeners and do deep research on companies. I'm just looking to hear some of your thoughts on Interdigital (IDCC). I'm supposed to pitch this stock next week for a club, so anything you have to say could greatly help. Firstly, they are super capital-light, even compared with other IP patenting companies. Their ROIC is around 40, while Qualcomm's (QCOM) is around 28, Rambus's (RMBS) is around 36, and Broadcom's (AVGO) is around 14. Granted, IDCC is a pure play patent licensing company, and I'm still working on comps analysis, but I think this structure is what helps them be so highly profitable. They have 430 employees, and over 50% of them are R&D, super efficient. Elon would love. They also have around 80% of the smartphone market, and 50% of the PC market under contract, and are expanding into the Auto and IoT sectors with Avanci, which licenses patents for major car companies, covering around 80% of car shipments. They also generate a large portion of revenue through video and cloud-based streaming solutions, and their joint license with Sony. Let me know if I missed anything or if you know of anything else I could potentially talk about in my pitch.

T,1o97ky7,ValueInvesting,IPM busted ipo/special situation in cyber security,"IPM was forcibly divested by Newtek Bank in January. Bank Regulators were unhappy about the non banking business. The company spun off the operations to a shell and here we are. Market Cap is $26M after dilution, there’s 8M in cash. Newtek bank retained a $5M earnout that we may have to pay out over the next 24 months. This earnout is somewhat but not wholly offset by earnouts from our legacy business. The company does ~25M in sales yearly at a 50% gross margin. Operating margin is near breakeven, so the company doesn’t make money currently, but has favorable unit economics if management can grow revenues. It’s important to note that the company is trading at 1x sales. So valuation could 3-4x on that basis. Customers are small business owners. Finally, there’s the margin of safety: the company may be free. There’s an IP lawsuit that the company won against Cisco for $65M. The post trial wrangling is going back and forth, but we shall see.

Laid off, part time work, income covers expenditures for now, but gig may expire at any reason, complex visa situation. Got into growth stocks so I can increase net worth instead of just breaking even. Put 22k in one stock. Went to 32k, then down to 17k. Net loss of 5k, but compared to peak 15k loss. My psyche was anchored to the high. Was hoping it 2-3x'd from there, so I didn't take profits. Go big or go home. Biotech stock, clinical trial safety issue. Would've likely 2-3x'd if trial is successful (it still may be in \~6months to 18 months). Depends on how this safety event clears, or if it doesn't. I've just never taken such a big loss before. Anyone who has been through this have any advice on how to process this? I felt really high when my first 10k 2x'd. Life was good. Net worth increasing despite complex visa situation and part time pay. I was still ""winning"" despite my shit situation. Now my social confidence is affected, I feel like a loser.

T,1oeycdp,investing,"DD: $GEVO -Ethanol-to-Jet, from cash burn to cash machine?","**Ticker: NASDAQ: GEVO** **Market cap: ≥ $500m (today)** **Disclosure: No position. Not financial advice.** Why I’m posting: I’ve skimmed al news and articles of GEVO for the pas 3 months and came up witht this: Simple version. They’re shrinking the first build to about 30 million gallons per year (“ATJ-30”) in Richardton, North Dakota. It sits next to an ethanol plant that already runs and has CO₂ capture on site. Fewer new pipes. Lower capex. Easier to copy if it works. Financing. There’s a Department of Energy conditional loan around $1.46B. It got extended this year while they adjust the scope to the smaller project. That keeps the funding path open while paperwork and engineering catch up. Ops. In 2025 they reported a quarter with positive net income and positive Adjusted EBITDA. Not claiming it’s huge, just noting it flipped from red to black on those lines. How they plan to scale. The idea is a standard box (their alcohol-to-jet “kit”). Drop the same setup at other ethanol plants. Some could be licensed, some could be owned. The “70 plants” number is talk, not signed deals. **What matters for the market (facts only).** SAF blend mandates are written into law in a few places and step up over time. In the U.S., clean-fuel production credits start from 2025 for low-CI gallons under published guidance. Today SAF is under \~1% of global jet fuel, even after big growth headlines. That’s just the status, not a call. **What actually happens next (admin stuff).** Map the extended \~$1.46B DOE loan to ATJ-30 (ND) in final paperwork. Lock the design, then FID, then EPC. After that, shovels. Do the offtake contracts and any license agreements. Next quarters show the usual ethanol/CCS/credit numbers in the reports. Local read this week. The Richardton public meeting sounded calm and practical. City folks and their lawyer asked about traffic, what the site will look like, and timing. No drama in the write-ups I saw. **Extra context I noted.** The Richardton ethanol site is already operating, so utilities and permits aren’t from scratch. They’ve named a process licensor for the ethanol-to-jet route, which helps standardize the design and documentation. They still talk about co-location because it helps the carbon intensity score when you have CCS next door. **Risks (just listing them).** Rules can change (mandates, credits). Loan documents and the rate environment matter. Permits, certification, and construction schedules slip sometimes. Other SAF routes exist (HEFA, e-fuels, waste-to-jet). Supply chains can be annoying. That’s it. I’m not in the trade. Just writing down what I found.

T,1o8q50l,ValueInvesting,What do you think?,"My High-Conviction Deep-Tech Portfolio — Betting on Hydrogen, Batteries, Robotics, and AI Hardware (Would Love Serious Opinions) Hey everyone, I wanted to share my current portfolio and get your views on whether I’m positioned in the right industries for the next 3–5 years. I know it looks risky, but I’ve been intentionally building exposure to what I believe are the foundation layers of the future industrial economy — power, storage, robotics, and autonomous systems. My portfolio right now: • PLUG (Plug Power) – 5,000 shares – Hydrogen / Clean Energy – around $18,600 value • DFLI (Dragonfly Energy) – 12,000 shares – Battery Storage – around $16,200 value • ARBE (Arbe Robotics) – 7,800 shares – 4D Radar / Autonomous Tech – around $17,700 value • RR (Richtech Robotics) – 2,950 shares – Robotics / Automation – around $16,700 value Total portfolio size is roughly $69,000 USD. My Thesis I’m betting on industries that sit underneath the AI and electrification boom — the physical enablers of the next decade. • Hydrogen & clean energy (PLUG): The world’s transition to energy independence will need hydrogen and fuel-cell infrastructure. • Battery storage (DFLI): Without large-scale storage, renewable energy grids can’t function efficiently. • Autonomous radar (ARBE): 4D imaging radar is essential for next-gen mobility, defense, and robotics. • Service & industrial robotics (RR): Labor shortages and rising automation will make robotics mainstream across logistics, retail, and hospitality. In short, I call my setup the “Power + Brain + Body” triangle: – Power (PLUG & DFLI) fuels and stores energy. – Brain (ARBE) gives machines perception. – Body (RR) executes automation in the physical world. I Know It’s Risky These are small-cap, high-volatility names with dilution and cash-burn risks. I’m fully aware that the short term will be rough. But historically, innovation sectors rebound the hardest after macro crises. Governments eventually fund energy, AI, and robotics to drive productivity again. I’m okay being early — I just don’t want to be wrong. My Three-Year Outlook (Base Case) If these industries evolve the way I expect, I see roughly 130–180% upside across most of these names over the next three years. In numbers, that would put my portfolio somewhere around $170K in a normal recovery and possibly $220–250K in a strong bull cycle. In a worst-case macro crisis, it could fall to around $25K, but innovation usually comes back first. What I’d Like To Hear From You • Am I positioned in the right sectors for the next industrial/AI cycle? • Are these companies just too early, or does patience pay off? • What would you diversify into without killing the deep-tech theme? I’m not here to pump anything — I just want honest takes from experienced investors who’ve lived through past market cycles and understand how early-stage industries move. Appreciate any input, bullish or bearish. I’m here to learn and refine my conviction before 2026 hits.

T,1o779tq,investing,How does your portfolio size dictate asset allocation?,"Hi, being in my late fourties I'm sitting around 50/50 stock-bond split. But as my investment portfolio grows, so are my doubts whether that still makes sense :-) The way I see it, bonds serve two main purposes: 1. to cushion the psychological blow when markets tank, 2. to reduce Sequence of Returns Risk once regular withdrawals start. When we begin our journey, say with $10k or even $100k, point #1 matters more. The portfolio isn’t big enough for withdrawal plans yet, so staying sane through volatility is key. But things change once the portfolio hits \~$1M+. At that point, half in bonds (\~$500k) might be enough to cover several years of living expenses during a downturn, taking care of #2 (heavily depending on our lifestyle and where we live ofc, a different discussion). So if market drawdowns don’t shake you anymore and you’ve built the bond safety net, what’s the point of keeping a fixed 50/50 - wouldn’t it make sense to lean more heavily into stocks after a certain point?

Our expenses are ~90K per year. My job is stable (military). Previously my wife was thinking of going back part time to work and then returning full time when the youngest starts school. However, now that the end of maternity leave is rapidly approaching, my wife is having second thoughts about returning to work. The $1.6M we have saved should grow to around $6.1M over 20 years and a 7% growth rate. That should be plenty to retire on, if we’ll even be ready to retire at 50 with kids still in the home. If my wife were to stay home with the kid(s), we’d be able to cover all our expenses and still save for retirement. But it feels risky to take our foot off the gas. We’ve always saved a lot of our income, and maybe it’s the potential change that’s scary. When is enough enough? When would you feel comfortable taking your foot off the gas?

T,1oiu6z1,stocks,Returns vs Moral Compass,"(25 y/o) I’ve been investing for 5+ years. These past couple of years I have had some excellent returns. However here’s the thing, my picks that are doing the best are companies that I do not align with ethically (mainly environmental concerns). I have been struggling between knowing what’s “right” and just going with what I think will provide a return. For example, I’ve been researching TMC and thinking about investing. I genuinely think it could take off in the coming years, especially in the current political and economic climate. But when I read about their company, what they do, and how they justify it, it makes my stomach turn. Their FAQ even has a question like: “Isn’t the deep sea a pristine environment that shouldn’t be touched?”And their answer basically boils down to: The ocean’s already being harmed anyway, so mining it isn’t that bad. Which is such a shit answer. On one hand, I think this stock will do well. On the other hand, I feel like a shitty person even considering putting money into something that goes against what I believe in. How do other investors deal with this conflict? Do you just separate emotion/ethics from your portfolio? Or do you try to stick to ESG or “green” investments, even if the returns aren’t as strong? Lately, I’ve been feeling pretty doom and gloom about it all, and I guess I’m just looking for some perspective.

We have plenty left over each month where we could easily pay a couple thousand each month for a loan.

T,1ocfw33,ValueInvesting,Are Equal-Weighted ETFs the Smarter Play Now?,"Title: Are Equal-Weighted ETFs the Smarter Play Now? Everyone says to invest in index ETFs because they’re “safe” — but have you seen what’s happening right now with tech stocks? The explosion in a few mega-cap names is wild. Traditional market-cap weighted ETFs (like the S&P 500) give huge influence to the biggest companies, so when tech rallies hard, the whole index becomes overly concentrated.

I just assumed high-frequency, bot-like trading (especially when used in situations showing signs of sentiment manipulation or wash transactions) would be flagged at the brokerage level and cause account suspension, given the stricter regulations surrounding stock trading. I know you can protect yourself from falling for artificially manipulated supply and demand volume by focusing on higher-cap stocks, where it’s less likely that any smaller party could use a big enough position to meaningfully control the share flow and give unreal volume data. What are some helpful ways to identify possibly automated volume or artificial bullish/bearish indicators? Do you find it worthwhile to try to mitigate their effects, so you don’t misinterpret distorted market data?

I will provide some background about myself, why I want to start a fund, and the trouble I am encountering. If anyone could assist, it would take a huge load off my shoulders. First, I am in my late 20’s and have worked as a trader at a bank for the past three years. We are only a clearing firm and I took this job so I could watch institutional equity and fixed income trading activity. The result was fruitful. Over that period, I developed some multi asset strategies that blow every retail product and mutual I have seen out of the water. As an example, I run a couple of portfolios myself and for my family, I’ve been running a custom multi asset strat that is up 43% this year with an R squared of 0.1. Second, the problem is capital. Even averaging 50% returns would take years of my life starting with such a small sum of money that I have. I have developed unique tools and strategies, but don’t have the capital for it to be immediately life changing, and need to find capital somehow someway. Third, if someone could help set me on the right path at all, in terms of who to speak with to raise starting capital for an LP, it will save me my beautiful hairline and likely thousands of hours of lost time with my family in the long run.

Now, when we look at the formulas there are these: RfR = 10yr Bond Rate - US Default Spread = 4.00% - 0.25% = 3.75% . But there are two formulas for Cost of Debt, one is using Country Default Spread and other is not. Which one should I use for this exact scenario: 1. Cost of Debt = RfR + Default Spread(Country) + Default Spread(Company) = 3.75% + 0.25% + 1.00% = 5.00% 2. Cost of Debt = RfR + Default Spread(Company) = 3.75% + 1.00% = 4.75% . Note that I've cleansed RfR from US Default Spread, so I'm wonderind should I add it back or not when calculating Cost of Debt. On one hand it might seem that adding it back could be considered double-counting but if done other way, then US Default Spread is completely omitted. . And to expand double-counting question, do individual companies Default Spreads based on agency ratings include country specific Default Spreads or are they purely related to companies? . P.S.

T,1oqtret,investing,Amazon’s (Quantum) First Peak Was Just a Prelude: How the Dot-Com Crash Set the Stage for a Greater Rise,"Every great technological revolution begins with a spark and often, a premature peak. The dot-com era had one with the internet. Artificial intelligence has already seen several “winters” and rebirths. And now, quantum technology stands on that same precarious ridge: the hype is high, the potential enormous, but the infrastructure and economics are still catching up. The Pattern of the Premature Peak Amazon’s first boom during the dot-com bubble wasn’t wrong in spirit it was simply too early. The world glimpsed what the internet could become, but the systems, trust, and tools weren’t ready yet. The crash cleared away the noise, and what survived eventually built the future. Quantum technology today may be at that same “too-early” moment. Billions are being poured into startups, governments, and labs racing to claim “quantum advantage.” Yet, the field still wrestles with instability, scaling challenges, and limited real-world applications. To skeptics, that looks like over-promise; to visionaries, it looks like incubation. The Quiet After the Hype When the first quantum bubble cools and it likely will the world won’t abandon the field. It will refine it. The collapse of inflated expectations doesn’t kill an idea; it makes it real. Just as Amazon used its downturn to build logistics, cloud computing, and data mastery, quantum science will use its quiet phase to perfect error correction, hardware reliability, and practical algorithms. The Inevitable Second Peak Something will and can happen to quantum not because hype guarantees success, but because the underlying physics and potential are too powerful to disappear. When the second wave arrives, it will be grounded in hard-won progress, not speculation. The companies that survive the “quantum winter” will lead a new era not unlike how Amazon emerged from the ashes of the dot-com crash to define modern commerce. The Deeper Lesson Every breakthrough follows the same curve: imagination, inflation, collapse, and correction. The first peak is just the world dreaming too early; the second is when the dream finally matches reality. Quantum’s first peak may fade but its true rise hasn’t even started yet. Please set a reminder - you can thank me later.",0,0,2025-11-07 13:00:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oqtret/amazons_quantum_first_peak_was_just_a_prelude_how/,2025-11-07 16:43:29.254631,0.3,$T,0.8,[],[],0.6,Communication Services

What’s been interesting lately isn’t growth for the sake of growth, but how the company’s shifting focus toward running lean and smart. China’s aluminium industry is already bumping up against its official production limits, so Hongqiao’s no longer chasing new capacity. Instead, they’re fine-tuning what they already have moving smelters to Yunnan for cheaper hydropower, cutting emissions, and upgrading equipment. It’s a quiet shift from scale to efficiency, but it’s a big deal in a business this energy-heavy. That kind of move stabilises costs and shields them from energy shocks — something a lot of competitors still struggle with. It’s less about “how much” metal they make, and more about how efficiently they do it. Feels like a company that finally understands the cycle less noise, more control.

T,1ojroup,ValueInvesting,Why I think META will have to pay more in taxes going forward,"Under the CAMT implementation, a lot of DTAs that used to offset taxable income will not be as effective. Specifically, R&D deferred tax assets now will not offset taxable income, meaning META will going forward have to pay more taxes than they have been paying so far. This is because Capitalized R&D makes up a good portion of their DTAs. This affects META and not other companies (MAG7) because they don’t have DTAs that are as exposed to this new rule or just have less DTAs. Am I missing something here? Seems to me that unless this rule is taken out their effective tax rate is about to go up and they will have to pay more in taxes given they can’t offset taxable income as well as they used to. That’s also why their valuation allowance went up. We saw a spike in the book tax rate this quarter and will continue to see that being played out in their effective tax rate. I haven’t done the exact math but if they have 12% effective rate right now it would be around 14-15% under the new rule (couple billion more in tax).",5,5,2025-10-30 05:43:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ojroup/why_i_think_meta_will_have_to_pay_more_in_taxes/,2025-11-07 16:44:13.892260,0.3,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6,Communication Services

We spend hours scraping filings, comparing ratios, building models, backtesting everything we can. We tell ourselves it’s “research.” But most of the time, it’s just motion disguised as progress. Buffett once said, “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.” But what if impatience today doesn’t look like quick trades… but like compulsive data consumption? We scroll through financial dashboards like TikTok feeds chasing dopamine hits from new data points, new valuations, new narratives. But real investing isn’t about finding more data. It’s about building conviction from less. The irony is we now have access to more information than Buffett ever dreamed of. Yet most of us are worse decision-makers than investors from the 1950s. Because our brains were never built to process this level of noise.

The best investors don’t just think differently they filter differently. They know what to ignore. They build systems around discipline, not dopamine. I started to ask myself: What would my portfolio look like if I stopped chasing signals and started cultivating silence? When you strip investing down to its core, it’s not about P/E ratios or discounted cash flows. It’s about character. It’s about staying rational when everyone else is emotional. It’s about understanding that your biggest edge isn’t your spreadsheet, it’s your temperament. In a world drowning in information, wisdom becomes the ultimate alpha. If you’ve ever felt that your brain is too crowded to think clearly about your own investments, you’re not alone. That’s why I’ve been exploring ways to build tools that filter noise instead of amplifying it. Because maybe the next great “edge” in investing isn’t a new model… …but the ability to think like Buffett again. TL DR: We don’t need more data. We need more clarity. We don’t need smarter algorithms. We need quieter minds. How do you personally filter noise when researching stocks?

[Grand View Research+1](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/statistics/pharmaceutical-transportation-services-market/supply-chain/cold-chain-logistics/global?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Why this matters for Callan JMB: * When drugs and biologics need exact temperature control, any failure in storage or monitoring = risk of spoilage, regulatory penalties, or patient harm. * Callan JMB says they provide fulfillment, storage, monitoring and cold chain logistics services — so they sit right in the thick of that growth. * Real-world story: Emerging markets and vaccine/biologic distribution mean logistics networks are being stressed.

In short: faster growth + higher complexity = more need for providers who can deliver end-to-end, not just “storage.” The story isn’t just growth for growth’s sake — it’s about quality control, risk mitigation, and consistency in high-stakes logistics.",1,0,2025-10-23 15:42:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1oe6ola/cold_chain_logistics_temperaturesensitive_pharma/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.070445,0.3,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6,Communication Services
T,1ocgix5,ValueInvesting,Physical stores for Amazon,"I saw recently where people were stating that retail/grocery has very slim margins. It seems to me that the stores can be similar to a warehouse that will be used as a distribution facility, so isn’t this somewhat two birds with one stone? Why is Walmarts shipping, in particular for medication so quick? Sometimes as fast as an hour in some parts of the country? It’s because 1. They’re trying to compete with Amazons amazing logistics 2. Because they’re able to given the expansive amount of store locations they have. I think that looking at the margins of the stores only is not looking at the big picture. It is also, at the bare minimum, marketing Amazon. Edit: I am sorry if some of you guys don’t like that my posts aren’t full of statistics and numbers, but I feel that some of these ideas are worth at least thinking about, even though it’s not the biggest driver, why is Amazon expanding Amazon Fresh and why did they purchase a grocery chain if it wasn’t strategic / for good reason?",1,3,2025-10-21 15:47:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ocgix5/physical_stores_for_amazon/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.086426,0.3,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6,Communication Services

T,1ocbiwg,ValueInvesting,Bridging Crypto and Reality: My Shift Into Real World Asset Trading,"A few months ago, I started rethinking my trading approach after realizing how disconnected most crypto narratives were from real-world value. I have been deep in DeFi and memecoins for years, but after the latest market swings, I wanted something that actually *linked blockchain with tangible assets,* something that made sense beyond the hype. That’s when I began exploring **Real World Assets (RWA),** projects tokenizing things like stocks, bonds, and even commodities. It’s crazy how fast this narrative is growing. It’s like the bridge between traditional finance and crypto is finally being built, and we’re early enough to walk across it. Through **Bitget**, I started testing RWA exposure via tokenized U.S. stocks and onchain trading. What stood out is the accessibility, 24/7 markets, instant settlement, and no middlemen slowing things down. You can trade exposure to real companies and real assets but stay entirely within the crypto ecosystem. It feels like the best of both worlds, the structure of TradFi with the freedom of Web3. For me, RWA trading on isn’t just another market trend; it’s the evolution of investing. The ability to hedge crypto volatility with real world backed assets in the same place is a serious edge. I genuinely think this is where a lot of smart traders will rotate next, where blockchain meets real utility. Anyone else diving into RWA trading lately? Curious how you’re balancing it with your crypto portfolio.",0,4,2025-10-21 12:25:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ocbiwg/bridging_crypto_and_reality_my_shift_into_real/,2025-11-07 16:44:16.089259,0.3,$T,0.6,[],[],0.6,Communication Services

What really prevent individual investors from organizing and acting collectively to protect their rights and make sure that they are an active player in drafting the corporate strategy? not just merely passive followers who are accepting whatever thrown by big institutions and funds of ultra wealthy people. We are in age where communication and organization were never easier because of technology-enablement. Investors from all over the world can nominate their representative who can take a seat in board of directors to ensure that interests of small investors are being considered and communicate results on regular basis with the investors; Simply, to be liaison between the company and small investors. If there were a social media channel designed to amplify small investors' voices in public companies by syndicating them, would they be interested in joining?

I started a public list so people can browse by category, add missing tools, and upvote what’s actually useful.
