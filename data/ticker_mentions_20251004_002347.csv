MSFT,1nlztft,pennystocks,$NUAI Full DD and breakdown of evidence as to why I believe $MSFT is the hyperscaler on their LOI for 250-1000MW powered land.,"https://preview.redd.it/7xjb8ahwybqf1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9c70f2c5ebe229e21ac6f213670f6b6b3bf945 New Era Energy & Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUAI), a nanocap company with a $10 million market cap, got ambitious plans for data centers and fiber networks, hinting at a major hyperscaler partnership. Evidence points to Microsoft as the likely partner, driven by NUAI’s helium and natural gas assets, strategic infrastructure deals, and ties to Microsoft’s technology ecosystem. Here’s why I believe Microsoft would be interested in a small player like NUAI, and how their plans align. I’ll also address the delist notice and why I believe NUAI will meet the requirements for NASDAQ compliance. This is not financial advice, this post is speculative guesses based on publicly available information. Penny stocks like $NUAI without definitive agreements and revenue certainty remain highly speculative. Do your own due diligence. # In a hurry? 1. **Context Labs Partnership**: Microsoft is the only hyperscaler with a confirmed tie to Context Labs, whose technology underpins NUAI’s sustainable data center plans. 2. **Fiber Network Alignment**: The GlobeLink-NUAI fiber route connects Microsoft Azure hub cities, and the timing of Microsoft’s hollow-core fiber announcement aligns with the 1,600-mile MOU. Microsoft also plan to lay 15000 km of Hollow Core Fiber worldwide, so far no mention on where. 3. **Natural Gas and Helium Needs**: NUAI’s assets match Microsoft’s requirements for powering data centers and cooling quantum processors. 4. **Strategic Use of NUAI**: Microsoft likely leverages NUAI’s regional assets and permits to fast-track infrastructure projects. 5. **Delist threat:** NUAI received a Nasdaq notice on September 3, 2025, for failing to maintain a $50 million market value of listed securities (MVLS). The company requested a hearing, pausing delisting. A second 180-day grace period is likely, given NUAI’s operational progress # Take the plunge! **Exhibit A: Context Labs and Mawgan Capital’s Role in NUAI’s Build** The joint venture NUAI/Sharon AI, Texas Critical Data Centers (TCDC), signed a letter of intent (LOI) with Mawgan Capital to deploy a natural gas–based power system for its Ector County Data Center Campus in Texas. Mawgan, fully funding the project, will use its Digital Zero Power solution, powered by Context Labs, Context AI Enterprise Carbon Management Platform. This system leverages low-carbon-intensity gas certificates and carbon credits to provide sustainable, reliable power with a reduced carbon footprint, critical for eco-conscious hyperscalers. Context Labs has a confirmed partnership with Microsoft, integrating its decarbonization solutions with Microsoft Azure to optimize emissions tracking for data centers. As the only hyperscaler publicly tied to Context Labs, Microsoft’s Azure platform aligns perfectly with NUAI’s goal of building sustainable, high-performance data centers, **Exhibit B: GlobeLink Fibers and Microsoft’s Hollow-Core Fiber Ambitions** NUAI also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with GlobeLink Holdings to develop a 1,600-mile fiber optic network across Texas, part of GlobeLink’s broader 2,500-mile route. This network, designed for AI and hyperscale workloads with over 30 terabits per second capacity, will connect key cities like Odessa, San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas—many of which are Microsoft Azure core hub cities. This alignment suggests the fiber route is tailored to Microsoft’s infrastructure needs. In September 2025, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in hollow-core fiber technology through its 2022 acquisition of Lumenisity, achieving lower latency and higher bandwidth than traditional fiber. Microsoft plans to deploy 15,000 km of hollow-core fiber worldwide but hasn’t specified locations. The 1,600-mile NUAI-GlobeLink project, starting in Odessa where NUAI’s assets are located, could be the first leg of this rollout, leveraging NUAI’s regional permits and rights-of-way to streamline deployment. **Why NUAI for a Major Infrastructure Project?** A nanocap like NUAI securing an MOU for a massive 1,600-mile fiber project seems improbable unless it’s acting as a regional facilitator for the hyperscaler. NUAI’s land assets in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, including its Pecos Slope Field, provide access to natural gas and helium, plus critical permits and infrastructure rights. Microsoft could be using NUAI as a “shell” to navigate local regulations and accelerate project timelines, avoiding the complexities of direct land acquisition. **Microsoft’s Natural Gas-Powered Data Centers** Microsoft has been exploring natural gas to power its data centers, aligning with NUAI’s LOI with Mawgan for a behind-the-meter natural gas power system. Context Labs’ emissions control technology, integrated with Azure, ensures these data centers meet sustainability goals by tracking and mitigating carbon output. This setup is ideal for Microsoft, which is scaling its Azure data centers to meet AI and cloud computing demands while maintaining environmental commitments, Q45 reporting and net zeron operations. **NUAI’s Growing Hyperscaler Discussions** Since November 2024, NUAI has been in talks with high-energy users and hyperscalers, with project scopes escalating rapidly: * **November 2024**: Plans for a 90MW data center. * **January 2025**: Expanded to 250MW. * **July 2025**: Scaled to 1,000MW. * **September 2025**: Plans for 1,000MW and beyond, plus the 1,600-mile fiber network. This growth suggests a major hyperscaler is driving demand. **NUAI’s Helium and Natural Gas Assets** Originally New Era Helium, NUAI pivoted to energy and digital infrastructure after failing to complete its Pecos Slope helium plant. While its helium contracts underperformed, NUAI’s 137,000 acres in Southeast New Mexico hold proved and probable helium and natural gas reserves. Hyperscalers like Microsoft need both: * **Natural Gas**: Powers data centers efficiently, especially with Context Labs’ emissions controls. * **Helium**: A finite resource critical for cooling Microsoft’s Majorana 1 quantum processor, which requires near-absolute-zero temperatures in dilution refrigerators. Helium is also used in semiconductors, data center cooling research, nuclear reactors, and quantum computing. Helium demand is projected to grow significantly by 2035, driven by quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, space applications and AI infrastructure. As a finite resource, helium’s scarcity makes NUAI’s reserves increasingly valuable to a hyperscaler investing in quantum and AI technologies. **Avoiding Nasdaq Delisting and Reverse Split** On September 3, 2025, NUAI received a Nasdaq notice for failing to maintain a $50 million MVLS after a 180-day grace period ending September 2, 2025. NUAI requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, which pauses delisting pending the hearing’s outcome. At the hearing, NUAI will present its compliance plan, including raising capital via equity lines or private investments (PIPEs) to boost shareholder equity above $2.5 million or achieve a $35 million MVLS for the Nasdaq Capital Markets tier. **Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) before Christmas is optimal**: During the hearing process, normally delisting is paused, allowing $NUAI to continue trading for approximately 2–3 months until a decision is made. The panel could grant a second 180-day period if $NUAI demonstrates a viable plan to boost its MVLS (e.g., through partnerships, asset sales, or equity offerings). While $NUAI has been communicating construction starts this year, what’s left is obtaining the final permits, negotiating terms in PPA and securing the hyperscaler customer with a definitive agreement before first shovel in ground. **Operational Progress to Boost Valuation**: NUAI’s partnerships with Mawgan Capital and GlobeLink, plus its hyperscaler discussions, are driving operational momentum. The LOI with Mawgan for sustainable power and the 1,600-mile fiber MOU signal significant revenue potential, likely increasing NUAI’s market cap. These projects, tied to hyperscaler demand, could elevate valuation in the coming months, especially if Microsoft’s involvement is confirmed. **Second Grace Period Likelihood**: Many companies receive a second grace period after a hearing if they demonstrate credible progress. Nasdaq often grants extensions for promising plans. NUAI’s strategic partnerships and hyperscaler traction make a second grace period likely, potentially extending into Q1 2026. **Reverse Split as a Last Resort**: A reverse stock split is a tool NUAI could present to Nasdaq to show readiness to meet listing requirements by reducing shares and boosting share price. However, NUAI is unlikely to pursue this immediately, prioritizing capital raises and operational milestones. A reverse split would likely be tabled only if the potential second grace period ends without compliance, expected in Q1 2026. Based on the trajectory $NUAI is on, the “delist-scare-period” is where I'm loading the boat. If everything materializes and project milestones keep being met, I believe we’re in for a good ride in the upcoming quarter.

GOOGL,1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better. However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it. When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value. After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years. From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500. Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations. Anyways here are the results: FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price? Probably not. Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs. That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

META,1njv8wk,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed. The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures. “These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said. With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said. The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30. The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June. The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos. The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today. Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today. Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

AMZN,1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. Here’s where it’s free money: 1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called. 3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two. I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngal7f/amzn_covered_calls_free_money/,2025-10-03 16:04:26.015273,1.0,$AMZN,0.8,[],"['bull', 'calls', 'profit']",0.7171428571428571
NVDA,1ndmtz7,ValueInvesting,Built an AI tool that analyzes individual stocks and gives specific buy/sell/hold advice - testing if this is actually useful,"I created an investment tool that's different from typical robo-advisors. Instead of just portfolio allocation, it analyzes SEC filings and gives specific guidance on individual stocks. Here's sample output: \[\*\*FINANCIAL ANALYSIS:\*\* Apple (AAPL) has demonstrated strong financial performance. In Q1 2025, the company reported total net sales of $124.3 billion, a 4% increase from $119.6 billion in Q1 2024 (Document 9). The company's net income also increased to $36.3 billion in Q1 2025 from $33.9 billion in Q1 2024. Apple's product revenue was $98.0 billion while the service revenue grew significantly to $26.3 billion from $23.1 billion. This indicates a diversification of revenue streams, which is a positive sign. The company's gross margin improved to $58.3 billion (46.9% of net sales) in Q1 2025 from $54.9 billion (45.9% of net sales) in Q1 2024. Apple's cash flow remains strong with operating activities generating $91.4 billion in cash compared to $88.9 billion in the prior year (Document 8). The company also returned significant capital to shareholders, with share repurchases totaling $69.9 billion. However, Apple's debt structure is worth noting. As of June 29, 2024, the company had outstanding fixed-rate notes of $98.3 billion compared to $105.1 billion as of September 30, 2023 (Document 10). \*\*WARREN BUFFETT INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE:\*\* \*\*Business Quality Assessment:\*\* Apple operates in a simple, understandable business of technology and consumer electronics. It has a strong brand and a loyal customer base, indicating a strong competitive moat. However, the technology industry is characterized by rapid changes, and Apple's future success depends on its ability to innovate and stay ahead of competitors (Document 6). \*\*Financial Strength Evaluation:\*\* Apple's financial health appears strong with consistent earnings growth and robust cash flows. The company also has a strong balance sheet, despite a considerable amount of debt. The company's aggressive share buyback program demonstrates confidence in its future prospects. \*\*Valuation Analysis:\*\* Given the strong earnings and revenue growth, Apple's current valuation needs to be compared with its historical averages and industry peers to determine if the stock is trading at a reasonable price. \*\*Long-term Investment Outlook:\*\* Apple's long-term prospects look promising given its strong brand, innovative capabilities, and diversified revenue streams. However, the company faces significant legal and regulatory challenges that could impact its operations and financial performance (Document 1, 2, 5, 7). \*\*INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION:\*\* Given the strong financial performance and promising long-term prospects, I would recommend a \*\*BUY\*\* for Apple's stock. However, it's crucial to buy at a fair price and not overpay. Also, investors should closely monitor the ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, as they could have a significant impact on Apple's business. As Warren Buffett says, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" Apple is a wonderful company; the key is to ensure we buy it at a fair price.\] **Testing a specific use case:** Say you own 100 shares of NVDA and want to rebalance your portfolio by December. Would you want the tool to tell you: A) Just whether NVDA is a buy/sell/hold overall B) Exactly how many shares to sell/keep based on fundamentals and portfolio balance C) Educational framework on how to calculate this yourself **Questions for this community:** * Do you currently get specific guidance like option B anywhere, or do you just figure it out yourself? * What would actually change your investment decisions vs what just sounds helpful? * Is there a gap between good analysis and knowing what to do with it? Looking for honest feedback on whether this addresses a real problem.

MSFT,1nf2vtj,stocks,(09/12) Interesting Stocks Today- An AI for an AI makes the whole world blind?,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. News: [Apple Postpones Release of New iPhone Air in China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/apple-postpones-release-of-new-iphone-air-in-mainland-china?srnd=homepage-americas) [**WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&p=d) \- Paramount/Skydance are preparing a bid for WBD, reportedly backed by Larry Ellison. This stock exploded around 10:30 PT yesterday, moving from $13.50 to $17. Currently I'm interested if we can continue momentum today (it's held up decently well). More media sector consolidation, the last time we've seen something like this is the failed bid for Paramount (which later led to Paramount/Skydance). Obviously deal risk is the main concern here, if talks fall through or the rumor is refuted then we'll go back to original price. [**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&p=d) \- OpenAI has received Microsoft’s approval to transition its for-profit arm, thus boosting strategic AI partnerships. This move essentially signals confidence in MSFT's continued collaboration with OpenAI and AI-driven growth and presumably means that they'll use MSFT products like Azure for their cloud compute. This happened afterhours yesterday, and moved the stock 2%. MSFT has moved back slightly, not so interested in this unless we have a huge surge of volume off the open. [**OPEN (OpenDoor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d) \- Stock price has gone gangbusters since the appointment of Kaz Nejatian, Shopify’s former COO, as the new CEO. We moved from 6->10 in the past 2 days, not interested in a long, maybe a short if the stock price goes parabolic to something like 15/20. Stock is pretty liquid (millions of shares every minute) so no concern with getting size if needed. It's also a meme stock, so we'll see how this turns out. [**ORCL (Oracle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d) \- ORCL is selling off after one of the craziest earnings moves I've ever seen, but it's retraced back significantly from the $345 high.

AAPL,1n96la8,investing,Looks like Warren Buffett proved it was time for him to retire,"Just was noticing AAPL is having a good run and thought I'd look and see what price it was when BRK sold. For reference, AAPL is trading at $240 this morning, Buffett sold at $190-$200. So basically, BRK gave up a 25% gain so they could buy more 5% treasuries? Yikes. Buffett looked like a genius in April when the tariff's first hit but for the past 6 months the S&P 500 has beat BRK 10-to-1. He's still slightly ahead of the S&P 500 YTD but over the past 12 months the S&P 500 is up 18% compared to 9% for BRK. What's interesting is BRK actually had a good run against the S&P 500 for several years, which was largely timed along his ownership of AAPL. I understand a conglomerate like BRK sitting on cash is not necessarily the same as ""timing the market"" like us regular joes. But Warren said for years there were no good deals, while the market has continued to say otherwise. EDIT - I'm getting a lot of grief over this. But if you look at what WB has said in the recent past, what he did with AAPL goes against the grain of what has made BRK successful. In 2021 after selling his airline positions at a loss Buffet said ""When we sell something, very often it’s going to be our entire stake: We don’t trim positions. That’s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We’re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%. If we like a business, we’re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,” he added. “And when we change our mind we don’t take half measures.” Again that quote wasn't from the 80's, that was 4 years ago.",0,36,2025-09-05 14:20:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n96la8/looks_like_warren_buffett_proved_it_was_time_for/,2025-10-03 15:57:15.998505,0.9500000000000001,$AAPL,0.8,[],['loss'],0.7057142857142856
META,1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts. ## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis • **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it • **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%) • **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth ## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400) ### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification • AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined • Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million • More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth • New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration ### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership • Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery • Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver • Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs • Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others ### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value • Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition • Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix • Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals • High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns ### 4. Advertising Business Growth • Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta • Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually • Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins • Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix ### 5. Logistics Network Scale • Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined • Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify • Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally • Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",263,114,2025-09-24 21:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,2025-10-03 16:07:02.001655,0.9,$META,0.9,[],"['earnings', 'revenue']",1.0

META,1nvs1pu,stocks,Apple tables Vision Pro sequel to pursue smart glasses: report,"Apple has tabled its efforts to produce a follow-up to its Vision Pro headset in favor of developing a new line of smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence, according to Bloomberg. The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display. Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said.

NFLX,1nij58k,wallstreetbets,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)** Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money. * [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/) **I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:** 1. **$WBD Deal** * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it’s Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns. 2. **Oracle/TikTok** * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok’s US assets. If you think Larry’s not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY’s content library, you’ve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers’ screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here. 3. **Value Dispersion** * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced. * PSKY’s market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement. * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney’s balance sheet. **I’m no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.** **TLDR:** $PSKY....

NVDA,1npthoa,pennystocks,POET is about to do extremely well in the next few months,"Thanks to NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: POET) POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. “POET announced that it has received an initial production order from one of its lead customers, valued in excess of US$500,000, for optical engines based on the POET Optical Interposer™ platform technology. The optical engines that have been ordered are scheduled to ship in early 2026 and production is expected to grow to high volumes as the year progresses. The Company also stated that during the past few months it has fulfilled multiple orders from other customers for the purpose of high-speed transceiver module development.”This is really significant, I am not sure the market understand what this means, they will catch on. Expect the whales to load up. I believe this order represents the first qualified design in its final configuration. The ramp to full production can now begin! It is a major accomplishment. More orders and products to come as customers become motivated to place their orders and ensure their position in the line. This is the proof that many investors were looking for to provide confidence that this new technology is being adopted. POET is also nominated for an ECOC Award for “Most Innovative Hybrid PIC/Optical Integration Platform”. Awards are announced on September 30. I believe in the next few months we will see POET climb to at least 10$. Also if you check the call options especially for 6$ 10/10 there are tons coming in daily.

META,1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real. 1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash. 2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective. 3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years. 4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going. PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward. tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",115,56,2025-09-19 11:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,2025-10-03 16:07:02.003859,0.8,$META,0.9,[],"['revenue', 'ipo']",1.0

One thing might be behind the fall – a post from a billionaire. * Tesla boss Elon Musk echoed boycott calls, writing on X: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” targeting the pro-transgender messaging of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park. * The selloff may not be directly linked to his comments – stocks don’t usually move on culture-war tweets alone – but markets aren’t exactly immune to Musk’s megaphone either. **Boycott Fears or Just Noise?** * Investors might be quietly wondering whether this morphs into something bigger.After all, Netflix is no stranger to political or cultural backlash – though historically, it shrugs these off. * Streaming is sticky. Cancel campaigns have rarely translated into a sustained drop in subscribers, especially given Netflix’s scale and diversified content library. * Still, even the perception of reputational risk can move a stock in the short term, particularly when traders are hunting for reasons in an otherwise bullish tape. **Bigger Picture Still Strong** * Context: Netflix shares are up 32% this year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 14% gain, proving investors see the platform as resilient in choppy macro conditions. * Growth levers like ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, and global expansion continue to fuel optimism, even if one-off controversies grab headlines. * Musk’s post may not ding the fundamentals, but it added a twist to a day when Netflix underperformed while the rest of Big Tech marched higher.",0,3,2025-10-03 10:39:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwvl68/nflx_netflix_stock_sheds_24_was_it_because_of/,2025-10-03 16:08:50.228556,0.7999999999999999,$NFLX,0.8,[],"['bull', 'calls', 'support']",0.6171428571428571

MSFT,1nddyqw,wallstreetbets,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet. Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling. **Cloud revenue ratio** * Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio * Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5–12× **Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)** * Company | Market cap (we’re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR * CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9× * NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53× To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave. With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's. It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract. Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities. The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more. This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible. Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year. **NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract** * Phase | Year | MW | Notes * Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted * Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted * Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap **Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's** * Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr * CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M * NBIS | $105.1M | \~40–55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91–2.63M) https://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7 So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions. Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25. **YE’25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue** * Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev * (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW) https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom. If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25. On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026. * **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4. * **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band. Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield. https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362 https://preview.redd.it/vgjez2er4cof1.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f6dbbfc99515a399cf88299f24f6d035dc4c0a Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end. To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW. CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online. https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1 For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range. https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04 With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know. BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops? Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3. https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1 This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing. If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

MSFT,1nf707d,ValueInvesting,Is Qualcomm a value stock and a great buy with upcoming FED cuts and current P/E ?,"So I've been analyzing the stock and with it's margin being close to MSFT and GOOGLE rather than AMD or Broadcom it seems to be greatly undervalued with P/E of just 15 when peers are double of that. Current forecasts are pretty bad and that's the last thing company needs to return to P/E around 25 which would increase the price drastically without making the stock too overpriced related to its peers. Political risk is on the line US-China as Qcom profits depend on it, but with Trump allowing Nvidia selling high-tech chips I think there won't be any ban imposed. Another thing is the new AI-empowered devices. I think that could be reason for more people to replace their old device with newest ones that offer real time translations or photoshop-like photo edition on your device without access to the internet. That could boost smartphone sales once again which could be another catalyst for stock growth and better forecasts. Besides that, who knows what OpenAI is cooking (new device type for AI, could QCOM benefit of that?) Rate cuts should boost consumer market and that should include electronics and cars which are not priority purchase for most households. I already own 5% of my portfolio in QCOM and it paid good dividend so far, but after I ate a lot of cheap GOOG I am looking now to balance out my portfolio little bit.

AAPL,1nfug9n,ValueInvesting,My due diligence on compounders for Sep 2025,"For the past 5 ish years, I've been trying to build positions into high-quality businesses for the long term. I'm looking for uninterruptible high ROIC and growing margins to signal strong moats. These are some of the businesses that stood out: AAPL - Fair price for a wonderful company. Negative sentiment all around. Consider the quality of its business and the authority they have in their space (control of the App Store etc). The valuation doesn't seem that high to me. Market expects an achievable 19% FCF growth. Also, I like the thinner iPhone and I think it's going to sell well. They make premium products and they have satisfied their main customers just fine. Tech bros can talk their mouth off. Lots of global growth runway left as globally people earn more and can afford premium devices. V and MA: wonderful companies at somewhat fair prices. I'd buy more MA but I already have a large V position from the great prices of last summer. They are interruptible businesses from my understanding. Huge network moats. The only thing is crypto might disrupt them in the far future unless they adopt it somehow. I believe the govt will partener with them in some capacity, but I can't ignore their global growth. Not all countries will change their whole payment infrastructure to crypto overnight. Lots of global growth runway left as people earn and spend more. TPL Texas Pacific Land: wonderful company at a somewhat fair price. They make money on easy mode with almost no operational overhead. Obviously they are sensitive to oil prices / politics / US economy so this position has a modest target limit in my portfolio. BKNG Booking: wonderful company at a low price. They are a major player in international markets. The only thing is, their business is just a commission-based intermediary that can be easily bypassed. However, the management has been doing this for a long time and seems very competent in growing it so they clearly have a working recipe. Lots of global growth runway left as people earn and spend more on travel and Booking is a toll booth for that. IDXX Idexx Labs: wonderful company at a high price. But holy sh do they have perfect operations. They supply vet clinics with equipment and consumables (moat in switching costs). Very experienced in what they do and seems like they can't be interrupted. I don't see major risks with this one considering their scale and niche domination. Global operations so lots of growth runway left AND pets seems like a good industry: healthcare without as much competition and regulation compared to Human. I will be adding to this one when/if it dips to a reasonable level. MSCI: wonderful company at a fair price. Toll booth for global investing and economic growth. Huge moats in switching costs and niche authority. Investors were worried about retention rates at some point but I don't see anything wrong with them compared to their historical retention rates. Virtually unlimited growth ahead. This is what I've been buying recently. ZTS: wonderful company at a somewhat fair price. Global leader in pet pharma. They are experiencing a slowdown but should rip once they get it back. The issue is, they are dependent on expiring patents (2033 for 13% of revs, 2041 for 10% of revs). They are maintaining their global leader status and keep developing new products. They clearly have a recipe of efficient operations and this is a good entry point as long as they keep doing what they have been doing for the last decades. This is a more complicated business and I will sell out if it takes too much time out of my hands to keep up with. EVO Evolution AB: explosive growth trading dirt cheap. B2B online casino studio. They set up cameras and studios to film casino games. They sell those video streams to online gambling companies as a subscription. Excellent operations, niche domination. The issue is, they were sued by a private investigator for selling in banned markets (Syria Sudan and wherever). They were found not guilty by the US authority. Final consumers likely used VPNs to bypass those restrictions, nothing EVO could realistically do about that. Trading at a projected 6% FCF growth while they have been surpassing 30% constantly. One of the best risk-adjusted bets I could find. However risks regulation. Not for the faint of heart. FTNT Fortinet: wonderful company at a fair price. They sell cybersecurity hardware and cybersec cloud subscriptions. A must-have for all modern companies. Niche-domination, together with PANW. FTNT offers the more cost-efficient solution at large scales. Amazing growth and future prospects, at a discount. The investors got spooked by a weaker than expected product refresh cycle. However, the 25% dip was likely much too drastic for this quality a business. ULTA: wonderful company at a cheap price, but with growth uncertainty. They seem to have oversaturated the US market with their stores. Trades at a low 11% future FCF growth. They have no experience in global expansion, but that would likely be their only major ticket to growth. Have recently expanded in Mexico. If they can pull this off, they will win big from the current levels, but that's a big IF. Rock solid experience operating stores and customer loyalty. NICE: Customer Center as a Service: good business trading dirt cheap. Most companies need customer service, and they will adopt AI to do most of it. This is what NICE rebuilt itself to achieve (they've been doing regular/human customer service): sell a customer-tailored AI platform for customer service to companies. They are the 2nd largest player in their (old) niche of regular customer service. This comes to the benefit of having an existing pool of 22k clients. They are growing fast and their new AI platform is doing great. There are switching costs for clients. Growth runway is still huge. However, the CEO is a talking head and their reports are a bunch of marketing gibberish. The market projects a 7% FCF growth which is low considering their recent and constant \~20% growth. I don't really see the reason for the bad sentiment here. Other good businesses I'm waiting for a dip on: MANH, CTAS, ROL, LII.",20,19,2025-09-13 10:49:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nfug9n/my_due_diligence_on_compounders_for_sep_2025/,2025-10-03 15:57:38.007312,0.6000000000000001,$AAPL,0.6,[],['dip'],0.8057142857142856
TSLA,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :) I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people. I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion! **Portfolio Construction Rules** To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT. Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK. Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY. Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD. **So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD** Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure. **Reasoning** I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns. Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm. Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe). Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms... This leads to the value premium. However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed. Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns. However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices. We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love. Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time... Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts. The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion. For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation. I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own). It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500 It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade. The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed. So... What do you do about all of that? Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance. As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period. If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth."" Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%. To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns. Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index. Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do. However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above. **The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach. **Performance Analysis** Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like: MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio **Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR** **VT Return: 11.16% CAGR** Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems: We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult. This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT. Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy. For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it... **Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR** For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds. Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78% Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56% Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller. This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe. That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR** That's some significant outperformance! Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...) Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings. There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy... But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising **I know that was a long post... thanks for reading :)** **Thoughts?**",0,9,2025-09-28 03:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nse5u1/using_mgk_schd_and_schy_to_create_a_value_and/,2025-10-03 16:02:56.454683,0.6000000000000001,$TSLA,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'revenue', 'profit', 'split']",0.7342857142857142
MSFT,1npdpk7,ValueInvesting,CRWV and CORZ,"All previous crypto mining stocks transitioning to AI/HPC are going up. Why? Because big tech is throwing money at them. MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.",0,6,2025-09-24 14:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npdpk7/crwv_and_corz/,2025-10-03 16:01:44.289381,0.6000000000000001,$MSFT,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'acquisition']",0.7228571428571429
TSLA,1nw29np,stocks,Tesla gears up for Q3 deliveries… while Musk buys $1B in shares and Robotaxis expand,"Tesla is set to report Q3 deliveries on October 2, and analysts are raising expectations. William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits. At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock. That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk. Across Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels). Position disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far. What strikes me is the tension here: on one hand, bullish catalysts like stronger deliveries, Musk’s buy, and the Robotaxi rollout; on the other, valuation risks and Q4 margin concerns. Question to the sub: Do you think Tesla’s Q3 deliveries and Musk’s $1B purchase will be enough to support the stock at these valuation levels, or are we looking at a potential correction in Q4?",0,40,2025-10-02 12:22:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw29np/tesla_gears_up_for_q3_deliveries_while_musk_buys/,2025-10-03 16:02:35.146712,0.6000000000000001,$TSLA,0.9,[],"['bull', 'support', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.7228571428571429

GOOGL,1nvuluv,ValueInvesting,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why. Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income. This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything. Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations. So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks: * TSLA: 91.3x * NVDA: 59.0x * AAPL: 34.9x * MSFT: 28.3x * GOOGL: 22.1x * AMZN: 19.4x * META: 17.6x Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.",218,106,2025-10-02 04:49:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nvuluv/amzn_is_cheaper_than_you_think/,2025-10-03 15:59:42.915233,0.55,$GOOGL,0.6,[],['rally'],1.0
NVDA,1nhzrer,wallstreetbets,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story. APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years. The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today. If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**. 2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos. 3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect. I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps. Now, I’ll keep it real with you: * Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical. * Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things. * User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue. * CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times. **Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive.

MSFT,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? $300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out: OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely. $ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty.

MSFT,1ne8vin,wallstreetbets,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us. **TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in. First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas. Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**. To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are * 4.5 GigaWatts of power * Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\* * $300 Billion contract over 5 years Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process. For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra. For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas. Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power. Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT. **CoreWeave & Galaxy / Helios Phases & Timing** * **Phase I** * **Critical IT:** 133 MW | **Gross power:** \~200 MW * **Contract:** 15-yr lease signed **Mar 28, 2025** * **Delivery window:** **1H 2026** * **Sources:** Galaxy FY24/Q1’25 PR; Q2’25 call transcript.

[Galaxy Digital](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Closes-1-4-Billion-Project-Financing-Facility-to-Accelerate-Helios-AI-Datacenter-Development/default.aspx) 4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2’25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader “under study” pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power? And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property. https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26 https://preview.redd.it/dk4gtg6zejof1.png?width=2317&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2bb232f8e1fd2f61dbbc0319c786c7b23ba50d3 Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square. https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit. Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for. What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this. * What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand. * Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods) * And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks. * **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more** * **There is an insatiable demand for AI** To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need. So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done. And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you."" Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints. Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy. And it gets even better. Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked. What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler? Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago. The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too. https://preview.redd.it/m7wfsck4fjof1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33d66c4065dc93933a4174a66d95321146b6ee3 **Current Understanding of New EPA Rules** * **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure” was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the “**Begin Actual Construction**” definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn’t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com) * **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council’s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there’s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren’t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner. You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment. This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see. Here is Helios in 2024 https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719 If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush. Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today. [NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/) At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA’s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI. https://preview.redd.it/crm4amz8fjof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a727438a89a019d52ad6e012a73f53ec06da4f2 Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex.

Thanks for anything you may add UPDATE: I’ve been doing my project on 3 stocks for the last two weeks and I decided to track/invest in IONQ, GOOGL, and RGTI. Bunch of tech, seemed like a good bet/safe bet combo. IONQ ended up knocking it out of the park like I theorized, after it got the $21M project with the US Air Force, it was on the up the first Monday already. Bought 100 of these ‘fake shares’ for the class, and by the end made me wish I actually put money in! It was doing so well I ditched my stocks in GOOGL and RGTI and just decided to go all in. I overheard my professor asking a classmate if they would sell the second week or not, and didn’t know that was something we could do for the project. I was about $2.5k up and didn’t not wanna screw that up, sold ASAP on the 23rd and it dropped from there. Total profit is $2,561 from the initial $10k we had to work with, wish me luck in hoping no classmate made more in 2 weeks.

META,1ngz3fa,pennystocks,$MYO poised for a strong recovery,"Myomo is currently trading at a 2 year low of $0.85, and I believe now is the time to buy before it recovers significantly. Full disclosure: I am invested, and I worked at Myomo over 5 years ago. I made a new account to make this post because my identity can easily be figured out on my main account. Myomo has been severely punished by the market over the past 6 months for what in my opinion amounts to a short term marketing problem. The company announced at their Q2 earnings report that their usual means of lead generation including Meta ads has been falling flat, and they've needed to take a step back and reevaluate their marketing strategies. I don't mean to minimize it because marketing is critical to their success, but I also think that they will recover because they are a great company with an excellent life-changing product for folks with upper extremity disabilities. Additionally, CEO Paul Gudonis mentioned in the Q2 earnings report that they are already starting to see good results from their new marketing approach. Gudonis and Kirk Thomas (board of directors member) bought a significant amount of stock recently around $1, signaling that they believe the company will return to higher levels. Myomo nearly reached profitability in Q4 2024 and the stock was trading above $6. This tells me that they have the capacity to be profitable once the marketing issue is resolved. This is a big deal because it signifies that they have made great strides in 2 major challenges to profitability since I worked there. Profitability challenge #1: Reimbursement. Getting their customers reimbursed by insurance has always been the largest bottleneck to revenue for Myomo. A major win in this area came in January 2024 when a medicare code for automatic reimbursement took effect. Their usual business includes negotiating insurance reimbursement for each of their sales, and this change means that qualifying medicare customers don't have to go through that process. Their revenue in 2024 showed this impact. Profitability challenge #2: The Myopro 2 product line consists of standard factory-built modules assembled onto custom orthotics. For much of Myomo's history (and while I was there) Myomo had a single orthotics fabricator and was struggling to keep up with orders. The orthotics aspect of the device is fairly complicated for traditional orthotics shops so getting other fabricators involved proved quite difficult. I'm not sure when this happened, but I know that Myomo has brought the orthotics fabrication and final assembly of the device in-house. They started 3D printing the orthotics and heat molding them to casts of their customers. With both of these major bottlenecks resolved, I believe Myomo has the capacity to meet a much larger demand. Now it is up to marketing to generate that demand. The market is there for them. There is a massive unmet need for stoke survivors and folks with upper extremity injuries like brachial plexus, and they have the best/only product on the market with a significant barrier to entry for competition. A couple other things that I think are major positives for Myomo: 1. They are expanding internationally. Their main focus has been on Germany, and I believe they are continuing to expand into other large markets. 2. Their engineering team is extremely good at incorporating user feedback into their product development cycles. They have a strong local user base in the Boston area that they draw upon to try out product improvements. I cannot stress enough how good their product is. It not only gives people their independence back, but it also provides super effective therapy that can lead to people not needing the device anymore. I don't know WHEN MYO will recover, but I feel extremely confident that they will recover. The end of the year tends to be good for them as reimbursement claims tend to get approved slower in the first half of the year and much more as the year draws to a close. Their Q3 and Q4 earnings tend to be positive catalysts for the stock, but who knows what'll happen this year. I doubt that it will take much more than a year to recover back to the $2-$3 range, and right now that's an easy 2x (plus) gain. I believe they have potential to go much much higher than that in the next 5-10 years. This company is definitely going through some financial hardships right now, so I understand why the stock is priced so low, but they've been around for 15 years and have survived countless financial hardships. I highly doubt they will go bankrupt anytime soon. tldr; MYO is trading at $0.85 at the time of this post, and I think that they will recover due to my knowledge of their business, the industry, and because I've followed them extensively since I left the company over 5 years ago.",27,23,2025-09-14 18:37:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1ngz3fa/myo_poised_for_a_strong_recovery/,2025-10-03 16:06:23.135437,0.5,$META,0.6,['MYO'],"['earnings', 'revenue', 'profit']",0.8171428571428571

I just recently starting investing in Nov 2024 with a simple portfolio of 70% VOO 15% GOOGL 10% UNH and 5% AMZN. I am up about 18% YTD so far, but have yet to purchase any options. Today, I was looking at the AMZN options chain on Schwab and saw a bid price of 5.40 for the Dec 200 put option. This got me thinking. I could get a premium of $540 for selling this cash secured put option and if I do get assigned the shares they would be at a cost basis of 194.60.

We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil. So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?

TSLA,1n8phu8,wallstreetbets,"2.8k to 50k, 1800% Returns Over the Summer","I started with 2.8k in AMD leaps back in February. They were down going into April, but a generational recovery happened and suddenly I was up bigly. Once school ended in June and I had free time, so I sold the leaps, and this is where the real gambling journey began. My first trades were just random weeklies, for example on the first Monday of July I bought TSLA puts when the line went up and calls when the line went down like a monkey. Believe it or not this was only the beginning of the retardedness. I read about Donald Jr.’s new SPAC in the daily thread so I decided to invest into CLBR / PEW calls, and was up bigly going into the merger. Then, when the merger actually happened and I got absolutely demolished. This Donald guy had successfully grifted me. I got mad at the market so I full ported into OPEN since y’all seemed to believe in it, however this time I actually made money. I’m not sure what the fuck I was doing but I bought both calls and puts, sold the calls at the top and then sold the puts after it got rugged in the middle of the day and made back the money I lost. The week after that I was feeling lucky I guess and went back to buying random shit (technically I never stopped doing it, there are like 200 other trades that I didn't bother mentioning, but this time specifically was just extra retarded). I don’t even remember why I got 10k worth of AMD calls but apparently I did, and there’s this one day where I was using half my port on SPY 0DTEs for some reason. At this point near the end of July I realized that I was being little bit too autistic, so in order to try to be slightly less autistic I went over to check out the value investing sub to and holy shit they’re even more autistic so I gave up and came back to wsb immediately. Saw some guy say that the Google antitrust remedies were coming out soon so I proceeded to full port GOOG calls a few times which yielded the biggest juiciest gains yet and boom now I’m somehow at 50k.

Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies.

Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential. • Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays. • Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus. • Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds. • Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery. Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

If they hit analyst estimates at $15.6 in FY27 with a PE of +20x (still below historic levels), then $LULU is a $312 stock. **2. Novo Nordisk | $NVO** $NVO has had a difficult year but they have a very strong presence in the diabetes and weight loss industries. They're also investing heavily into growth in Denmark, France, and NC to ride the growing obesity market wave. Currently trading at 14.6x PE whilst historically trading around double that. $113 would be a 100% move. **3. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals | $REGN** $REGN is a slightly higher growth value play with a current NTM PE in the 14x range whilst historically trading for +20x PE. P/B is also at 2.0x (historically +4.0x). With minimal debt and a current ratio above 7.0x, they're quite a safe play in a period of macro weakness. Their portfolio includes eye diseases (EYLEA), chronic inflammation (Dupixent), and cancers (Libtayo) which will all necessary despite economic conditions. I like $REGN a lot - it's on my watchlist. **4. Constellation Brands | $STZ** A recent Buffett addition to his portfolio in Q2 - $STZ currently trades at a 11.9x PE and a 10.5x EBITDA multiple with a 2.5% dividend yield. The alcohol industry tends to be more resilient in downturns than most industries. If $STZ can return to historic PE multiples in the +15x range then they should be trading at $204 given a $13.6 EPS (as per analyst estimates in FY26/27). **5. Merck & Co | $MRK** $MRK is currently trading at a NTM PE of 9.3x , which is very low historically and also lower than the broader healthcare sector. FCF has been steady and has generally traded upwards over the last few quarters reaching $1.68 per share in Q2. If $MRK can generate $9.61 in EPS in FY26 (in line with analyst estimates), and we apply a conservative 12x multiple then $MRK should be a $115 stock.

META,1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year. Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025. This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte. Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up. And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low. It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future. Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio?

Fundamentals (Ok - kinda solid): Good balance sheet (solid liquidity ratios + recovering solvency such as debt ratios), not great but ok looking income statement (EBITDA&net profit margin still trying to recover + still decreasing ROIC and ROE but still solid numbers), Cashflow statement doesn't look too great but I can see they are (1. laying low on CAPEX just maintaining and not investing into PPE; 2. Paying back shareholders) - exactly what a mature stage company should do. So overall, the fundamentals don't look bad to me. 2. Overarching Headwind (Nothing to be feared): I think this headwind is nothing to be feared as its gonna pass. People needs their stuff shipped, simple as that. And the orange king won't be in power forever. ( so I have AMZN + FDX shares & sold puts on UPS) 3. Valuation: A solid business trading at 13x earnings is a no brainer to me.

NVDA,1nsinid,ValueInvesting,Is Intel making a mistake?,"Full disclosure I have been interested in intel stock for a couple months now. Ever since the government took a 10% share in intel. I have been planning to invest 25k into the company but have not been liquid enough to do it just yet. I think intel despite its failings has a genuinely strong thesis. It’s the best US based foundry capable of producing microchips. With Chinas looming attack of Taiwan it is imperative for the U.S to have an answer for microchip production. China doesn’t have to actually take Taiwan to disable chip production , the process of making chips is so fragile that airburst from artillery could disrupt it. Microchips are core to Americas military , if TSMC is disabled we would see American military strength significantly weaken due to our weapons becoming difficult to replace and rearm. Intels success is literally a matter of national security. That being said Intel currently is a gutted company on the verge of collapse with only a few small signs of hope such as the NVDA investment. All of this being said I am not currently comfortable investing in Intel. Intel has seen a major increase in share price over the last couple weeks at a rate that seems detached from reality. Yes it has seen some minor wins but most of the gains are based on hype. “Intel in talks with TSMC” type of thing that doesn’t speak to the companies fundamentals. More so the stock has become a pseudo meme stock. I think this could be detrimental to the stock in the long run. If Intel stock keeps running up based on hype I think we will see a major retraction in the price in correlation with a market event. This type of fall will stunt intel’s long term growth due to investor fear of a repeat. Maybe even killing the company in the process. The question that I have is does my analysis make sense? I am still on the fence about investing in the company right now. I want to know if I should wait for the market correction or invest asap.",0,26,2025-09-28 07:59:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nsinid/is_intel_making_a_mistake/,2025-10-03 16:06:08.560493,0.45,$NVDA,0.6,[],"['rally', 'eps']",0.7114285714285714

GOOGL,1ntsp96,stocks,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/ One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries. So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share. Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",267,130,2025-09-29 20:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,2025-10-03 15:58:51.302424,0.4,$GOOGL,0.9,[],"['support', 'revenue']",1.0

MSFT,1nnki3f,pennystocks,DD: Why I’m Bullish on $ORCL and $NVNI (Oracle + Nuvini Partnership in LATAM AI Growth),"Oracle ($ORCL) just announced its participation in the largest technology event in Latin America — TDC São Paulo (Sept 17–19). They’re putting heavy focus on AI in the enterprise space through keynotes, workshops, hands-on labs, and immersive experiences. This matters because Latin America is an underpenetrated but rapidly growing AI and enterprise SaaS market. Now here’s where Nuvini ($NVNI) comes into play: • Nuvini is an Oracle partner → This partnership gives NVNI a direct seat at the table as Oracle expands its AI ecosystem in LATAM. • SaaS consolidator model → NVNI acquires and scales B2B SaaS companies in Brazil and across Latin America. Think of them as a mini-conglomerate for niche software businesses. • Oracle + NVNI synergy → Oracle gets local adoption and reach, NVNI gets to leverage Oracle’s AI + cloud infrastructure for its portfolio companies. Why I’m bullish: • $ORCL continues to prove it’s not just competing with $MSFT and $GOOG in AI/Cloud, but carving out unique regional plays. • $NVNI is small-cap, but with Oracle’s backing, it could ride the AI adoption wave in Brazil and LATAM. • LATAM’s SaaS and AI markets are still early-stage → huge runway for growth. Risks: • NVNI is a low-float, small-cap stock → volatility is high. • LATAM markets carry macro risks (currency, politics, inflation). My view: $ORCL = the safe, global AI cloud giant. $NVNI = the speculative, high-upside play tied directly to Oracle’s expansion in Latin America. If Oracle’s push in São Paulo is successful, NVNI could be one of the quiet winners that benefits from the partnership.",35,7,2025-09-22 11:59:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nnki3f/dd_why_im_bullish_on_orcl_and_nvni_oracle_nuvini/,2025-10-03 16:00:10.362709,0.4,$MSFT,0.6,"['NVNI', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'ORCL']",['bull'],0.9057142857142856

GOOGL,1nwa6yo,ValueInvesting,FactSet - If you missed out on Google,"I'm writing to inform you that FactSet, a financial data company with a strong competitive advantage is trading at fair value. My brief thesis: * FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription. * The customer retention rate is above 90%. * Manageable debt. * Strong track record of earnings growth. * Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25. * Revenue is still growing at a steady pace. * Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. * I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value. * A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

Are there others risks that FactSet is facing, and what do you think is FactSet's fair value?",33,38,2025-10-02 17:29:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nwa6yo/factset_if_you_missed_out_on_google/,2025-10-03 15:59:42.914521,0.4,$GOOGL,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'revenue']",0.8114285714285714

I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning. The main stocks I’m considering are: • AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side. • UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news. • SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

TSLA,1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks… are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world. But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory. What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new. Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA. These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand. Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it. So here’s the open question: If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge? Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

GOOGL,1nk44m2,ValueInvesting,PYPL just announced AI partnership with Google - thoughts?,"**TLDR:** Google-PayPal multi-year deal makes PYPL a key processor for Google Cloud/Play. Stock up 3% after hours. Could advertising data sharing be the real opportunity here? Google and PayPal dropped news about a multi-year deal where PayPal becomes a key payment processor for Google Cloud, Google Play, etc. Stock only gained 3% after hours which seems modest for what sounds like a significant partnership. PayPal gets integrated across Google's ecosystem and Google's AI gets incorporated into PayPal's security services. This seems more substantial than their usual announcements since it involves Google Cloud enterprise payments, not just consumer-facing features. What's interesting for me is that PayPal has been pushing into advertising lately, and Google obviously dominates that space. Could this partnership open doors for shared advertising data? Both companies could benefit from combining Google's search/ad targeting with PayPal's transaction data. That would be a pretty powerful combination for advertisers. Been considering picking up some PayPal shares. Does this partnership signal the bottom of the stock and maybe the catalyst PYPL needs to break out of its current trading range, or is that 3% aftermarket bump all we're likely to see?

The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end. “When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.” The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.” The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice. Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks. The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain. Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",708,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,2025-10-03 15:58:51.314626,0.3,$GOOGL,0.9,[],[],0.9999999999999999
