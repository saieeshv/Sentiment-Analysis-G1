1nrh1jt,GrowthStocks,West Red Lake Gold Mines: Breathing New Life Into Red Lake,"West Red Lake Gold Mines: Breathing New Life Into Red Lake



West Red Lake Gold is executing a textbook turnaround at the Madsen Mine—a fully built but previously troubled asset now under a new, experienced team.



Key Notes: 



Timing Advantage: 



Gold demand is surging as investors and central banks pivot back to hard assets. Analysts see potential for $5,000/oz gold by 2028.



Rare Supply Story: 



New gold mines are scarce. WRLG is among the few juniors actually bringing fresh production online.



Smart Acquisition:



Madsen was acquired at a discount and is being methodically restarted with enhanced drilling, new infrastructure, and strong financial backing (Sprott, Giustra).



Fixing the Past: 



Denser drilling, better mine planning, and upgrades like the 1.4 km Connection Drift address the issues that hampered past operators.



Growth Roadmap: 



Production ramping toward \~70,000 oz annually, with upside from Rowan and Fork deposits. Longer-term, WRLG is building a hub-and-spoke Red Lake platform with >100,000 oz/yr potential.



The Setup



9,550 oz produced YTD (Jan–Jul 2025).



Mill recommissioned, ramping toward steady-state.



C$41M raise just completed, providing cushion for ramp-up, growth projects, and M&A.



With an experienced leadership team led by CEO Shane Williams, strong institutional support, and clear execution milestones, WRLG is positioning itself as one of the standout Canadian gold turnaround stories in this bull market.

I’m trying to deepen my understanding of company financials and how to extract meaningful insights about growth, profitability, and debt from annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports. I’m particularly interested in the metrics, ratios, or qualitative information that experienced investors or analysts focus on.

	•	Which numbers or sections do you look at first to gauge sustainable growth?
	•	How do you assess profitability beyond just net income or margin?
	•	What signals do you consider most reliable when evaluating a company’s leverage or debt risk?

Any guidance, practical tips, or examples of the insights you typically extract from these filings would be highly appreciated.

West Red Lake Gold has filed its NI 43-101 technical report, formally validating the robust PEA for the Rowan Project in Ontario’s Red Lake district.

https://preview.redd.it/pd2to67nrdof1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=365f1d56a99382614146e6fe365ddeac447eddec

**Key Highlights:**

* **42% after-tax IRR** with modest initial capex (\~C$70M) through a toll milling strategy.
* Average **35,230 oz A**u/year over a 5-year mine life.
* High-grade resource: **8.0 g/t Au avg., 10.4 g/t in Year 1**, with recoveries up to 94.9%.
* Located just 80 km from the company’s operating Madsen Mine, leveraging regional infrastructure.
* Exploration upside from depth extensions, parallel veins, and new targets (Apex, Big Bend).

The filing represents a major regulatory milestone, underpinning Rowan as a capital-efficient, high-return growth asset within WRLG’s dual-mine strategy in Canada’s prolific Red Lake district.

1ncco9f,GrowthStocks,$100 → $1k? RR calls look like a 10x lotto ticket,"Alright, Fed looks poised to cut rates next week. RR’s in the Russell, so macro tailwind is strong af. Perfect setup.  
  
Markets are pricing in a \~90% chance of a 25 basis point Fed cut at the Sept 16-17 meeting, with a small (\~10%) chance of a 50bps move. That follows the mes­sage coming from the weak August jobs report and rising unemployment. It’s a really bullish macro backdrop for equities—especially those included in the Russell indexes.  
  
Today (Mon), RR’s options action was insane. Call volume clocked in at around 14K contracts, compared to only \~5K all of last week. That’s nearly 3× higher. That kind of sudden call buying spike screams “something’s brewing.”  
  
We’ve only got 2 weeks to go before the Sept 19 expiration which is also triple-witching (stock, index, and futures options all expire same day). Anything could happen to the stock price heading into that chaos.  
  
Why I’m leaning into picks right now:  
  
RR’s options have only been open for <1 week. In the last week of Aug, the stock shot up to $3.88 before a brief pullback, and today it’s back on the rise. Feels like the price hits $4+ soon.  
  
At this time before 9/19, buying calls like $4 or $5 could be a high risk/reward play. check this out: 10× $4 strike calls at $0.10 each only cost $100 total. If RR’s stock rockets past $4 into that exp week, call prices could spike, maybe $0.43 or even $1.10 this means 4 to 10× returns possibility.  
  
Plus, heavy call buying forces mms to hedge: they’ll buy the stock to offset, which adds buying pressure on RR shares themselves.  
  
Personally feels like a rare, small bet, but high return opportunity: Buy 10× $4 strike calls for $0.10? That’s $100. If RR pops, those calls could go 4× or even 10×. And if we hit $4 or above, mms hedging kicks in to help upside. Sure, it could bust and expire worthless, but at $100 total, that’s a risk I’m cool with taking for literally double digit upside potential.

Anyway at a recent club meeting I was reviewing different accounts and their risk and mentioned that money market mutual accounts are not FDIC insured so while they are relatively low risk, if you believe their may be an AI bubble, you may want to make sure emergency fund is in something like an HYSA instead. Weigh the pros and cons of the relatively small extra interest you get from a MMA account vs a HYSA right now for emergency funds, think about when you would need the funds, the risk of a bubble burst,  yadda yadda hopefully you all know his stuff. 

Well the next meeting. The youngest member of the club goes.

Confused I asked him what he meant and he told me he closed his MMA and bought dollar tree stock!?

I never once said to buy a single companies stock!? I'm an ETF person! And dollar tree? Where did that come from? I don't even shop there? Also I mentioned that your emergency savings may not be worth risking in an MMA and you stick it in 100% stocks!?!?!?

1nwq4tu,investing,What metrics do you use for MF/ETF buy orders?,"First I want to limit the discussion to mutual funds and ETF's since thats a bulk of my investments.

There are a few different research methods that I've found and liked, I wanted to create a discussion around them and see if there are any I'm missing out on.

1. 30 / 60 / 90 trend lines for timing the buys and sells over/under the line
2. Investors that publicly state buy/hold/sell suggestions (not any specific investor but monitoring multiple)
3. 3 / 6 / 12 month growth trends
4. Morning star risk rating, and fund classes 1-4 for balanced vs risky/industry specific funds
5. The 9 box val/growth and size metric and monitoring where in the chart I am vs where I want to be
6. Monitoring the percentage of investments (cash, foreign, domestic, ect)
7. Adding up the amount of a single stock across multiple funds to prevent overinvesting to one unintentionally 

I wanted to see if there are other things I should be considering, and if there are tools I can be using to help track these. I plan to build a tracker for this data, and have an API key with NASDAQ, among other sources... I initially wanted to build it for personal use but ended up beginning to build some complex features that I think others could benefit from so I was thinking of allowing other people to access it too (I already host it on a site I have for personal use anyway, so it would be easy for me to provide it if anyone was interested)

As I was thinking this, I realized there are probably so many other tracking methods that other people might need to be able to effectively use it. So I want to see what else is out there, and if there are some tools that exist (i.e. I dont want to spend the time to build something that I could just use freely, or not pay much for)

So what strategies do you all use? And which of mine do you use and how/why?",2,2,2025-10-03 04:58:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwq4tu/what_metrics_do_you_use_for_mfetf_buy_orders/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.237538

1nwpsor,investing,"Mandatory Market Shift: Why Digital Assets are Now a Diligence Issue, Not a Speculation Play, Post-SAB 122","The long-term investment landscape has fundamentally shifted. The SEC’s rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) in January 2025 opened the institutional floodgates by removing the capital barrier that prevented major, regulated banks from holding crypto for clients. This means digital assets are now moving from a speculative category to a mandatory risk and diligence category.  

1) The New Risk Floor: This institutional entry dramatically lowers the systemic risk profile for investors, meaning the barriers for large pools of capital (pensions, endowments) to justify entry are crumbling. The question is no longer if they should invest, but when.  

2) Tokenization as Portfolio Standard: Tokenized products are expected to shed their niche status and become standard menu items in mainstream portfolios by the end of 2025. This includes new RWA products like treasury-backed tokens that major banks are poised to offer directly to institutional clients.  

3) The Diligence Race: The current strategic challenge is the immediate race by major bank custodians to secure written non-objection from the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve. Diligence must now include assessing which banks are best positioned to capture this regulated first-mover advantage.  

What's your take? As an investor, is the biggest risk now missing out on the early, regulated RWA offerings, or is the lack of alignment among the FDIC and OCC still too large a regulatory uncertainty?",0,1,2025-10-03 04:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwpsor/mandatory_market_shift_why_digital_assets_are_now/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.237573

1nwkhly,investing,Factor Investing: Thoughts on Ep 316 Rational Reminder with Andrew Chen,"Hello all,

Not sure if everybody is following the podcasts, but for those who listened to this particular episode how is your conviction about factor investing?

My main conclusions:
 1) Publication bias: everyone want interesting things to read. According that, the sample chosen might indicate data mining, which can not be aligned with the out sample.
 2) Premium decay: arbitrages occurred already on the past due exchange of information, but now our capacity to share, analyse and execute everything has over escalated. So, lets say that the reaction to arbitrage is much faster.
 
Well, I am also reading the “Complete Guide to Factor-Based Investing” of A. Berkin and L. Swerdoe. Even if the premiums have gone, we might profit from diversification, mostly in small cap.

Current portfolio:
70% FTSE All World
12,5% Msci World Sector Neutral Quality
12,5% Msci World Momentum
5% Small Cap Value

I am not sure if I will keep it or go simple like:
70% FTSE All World
30% Nasdaq 100

1nwjw9t,investing,How to deal with fear and embarrassment,"23 years old. Male. 

After finally saving money and having some free cash to invest (10k) this march(2025), I put it in the market. I started with regular stocks and then went into options. All went well, I gained around 200$, then with options I was making gains of $3000. I got overconfident as usual and then the market tanked in April and I lost all my money. Basically totaling around $20k. From panic sells and what not. Ever since then I’ve been just in a deep state of depression about myself as a person, I blamed myself and I was embarrassed and thought I could do nothing right. Seeing the market reach ATH the moment I exited the market, and keep rising every day checking stocks daily just to see new highs made me feel even worse.

I recently found more inner peace by focusing on stuff that actually matters. Been going to the gym and spending more time outside and with people. 
Financially however things are not looking too bright. I still deal with a complete lack of confidence, embarrassment about money and yet another fear that once I start investing I will just lose it all .. 

how do you overcome this fear ? What do you do? Because right now I’m just lost and am more scared than ever about my financial future.",8,45,2025-10-02 23:46:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwjw9t/how_to_deal_with_fear_and_embarrassment/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.237675

Declining interest rates, high short interest and possibility for cnpv voucher are also something to consider.

I have strong belief what Intellia is doing and how it’s doing those things (CEO is very good imo).

For context, NASDAQ: MYNZ is pursuing a multi-cancer diagnostics strategy, with CRC commercialization now complemented by a high-need pancreatic target.

What to watch: feasibility readouts that confirm discovery-stage performance, initial clinical design outlines, and any partnering interest given the disease’s poor survival and screening gaps.

24% International (ex-US) Developed Markets 

12% Emerging Markets 

14% U.S. Small Cap Value 

8% International (ex-US) Small Cap Value

I have always thought that when it triggered, I would then sell a specific (different) losing position at the same time.

Read about it.  I'm not always connected to the market in the first couple of hours -- most of my trades really do happen almost unexpectedly, on a morning gap-up -- so  it seems to fit my need perfectly.  Tried to construct such a trade order this morning. 

And I learned ... that's NOT how they work.  You can't have two different holdings.  You apparently can only connect two different order TYPES for the SAME holding.  Sell it, enter a repurchase order automatically, for example.

I can't see how that's the least bit useful!

SO, THE QUESTION: UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS \*IS\* THAT TYPE OF ORDER USEFUL?  When would I want to automate a limit sell and a buy or the same stock?  Or a limit sell and another limit sell?  Who is the primary user of such an order ... daytraders?

Testing out the waters with stop limit quotes.  Invested in some tech stocks that people think will go higher, while others say they're primed for a crash/correction.  Playing with small amounts of $, but using stop limit quotes to sell.

I monitor the 52 week highs (which these days keep hitting ATHs) and set the STOP to be 95% of that high, and the LIMIT to be 90% of that high. My gains in these stocks here have already increased by 10-40% in the past few months.  Is that 5% gap big enough to create a likelihood that the sale will execute, in case there happens to be a quick drop in price below the LIMIT?  Is there an ideal gap between STOP and LIMIT?

You search the news on Google and there’s, what, 1 article per week? The market cap used to be ~€11B.

Market cap could be an option, investing more in bigger and more solid companies and less in the rest… but they are overall all quite big.

P/E ratio is interesting too but I don’t think one should invest more in a company just because it seems undervalued.

EPS is another metric I think should be taken into consideration but again can’t be the main one right?

1nv69yh,investing,Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. 

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 
3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

Depending on where you live -  you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. 

United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following:

1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 
2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to ""recover"" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 
3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers.

* Long term: this screams commitment to AI. Meta isn’t just playing around with chatbots or ads they’re building infrastructure that powers recommendation systems, future metaverse projects, and whatever comes next in large-scale AI.
* Competitive angle: it positions them to better compete with the giants already dominating cloud + AI Microsoft, Google, Amazon. Instead of renting capacity, Meta is basically locking down the horsepower they’ll need for the next decade.

1nuzdzn,investing,Why I keep buying uber shares below 100 everyday,"Here are few reasons Why I am bullish and why I think uber is still cheap below hundred.
I am on my mission to make uber my no 1 position in my portfolio.

1)   $40B+ annual revenue, growing double digits, yet still priced cheaper than many mid-cap techs.

2) Over $1B+ FCF, with potential to compound and I dont think it’s priced in.

3) stakes in Grab and Didi

4) Partners & Key Moves Uber & Lucid: Nuro is supplying the self-driving tech for a robotaxi fleet of Lucid SUVs, to be deployed via Uber’s service. 20,000+ robotaxis over 6 years starting ~2026. 

5) Nuro has years of delivery-bot testing, deployment in limited domains; its robotaxi program via Uber-Lucid is just ramping up.  
So basically what nuro does it builds its own autonomous driving technology so instead of selling cars like tesla it sells the brains basically self driving technology.
So I tell how uber can use it for its advantage as uber.
So basically Lucid makes the cars, Nuro integrates their Autonomous tech into their cars and uber put  it on their platform.
I know it can put pressure on margins but I think uber will find its way to increase their margins somehow trust the management.",0,26,2025-10-01 04:59:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nuzdzn/why_i_keep_buying_uber_shares_below_100_everyday/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.238393

The quarterly dividend record date for VINIX was 9/23, prior to the incoming transfer so no dividend for me to see there.

Am I being deprived of a quarterly dividend by the timing of this transfer between the two funds?

1nurs91,investing,Help understanding Book value and Market value when making investing desicions,"I am an incoming IB intern who is trying to brush up on their technicals.

I know and understand the definition of book and market value (ie book and market value of equity). What I don't understand is why the market doesn't consider book value (wholly) when making investment choices and why they indirectly mix together accounting with other valuation methods instead.

In your traditional university stock competition, the main valuation you undertake for a stock is the DCF ie cash flow discounting to get enterprise value, then minus debt and add cash/non op assets (roughly) to get Equity value. Now, I compare that to the market price.

  
I have a problem with this because its mixing up accounting principles with market perception of value.

Book equity value is just Assets- Debt, and then  
Therefore, enterprise value is equity value + debt - non-operating assets (roughly)

  
Now, what I don't get is how we can use market cap equity value and then use accounting terms to get to enterprise value, or how we can simply use DCF to get enterprise value, then use accounting principles to get equity value.

  
We are combining methods of how markets wish to value things like enterprise value (DCF) or equity value (market cap), and then mixing accounting principles even tho the accounting view and market perception view are not using the same basis, so how can we mix both LOGICS??????????",2,4,2025-09-30 22:49:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nurs91/help_understanding_book_value_and_market_value/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.238415

1nul9wm,investing,Fear Mongering from the Media,"I get stock ""news"" from cnbc and the wsj, and occasionally from other news that pops up elsewhere from others. It seems like at least every other day, there is a doom and gloom story that the market is going to go down. Sometimes I look up the author and notice that their background is in journalism, and they have no formal education in business, or finance or economics. Sometimes I notice the people writing these articles are just out of college.  
I'm starting to wonder if the media companies require a certain amount of these doom and gloom articles to be put out every week, simply because it draws on fear and fear gets more clicks, which in turn gets more eyeballs on their ads. It would be interesting to look at all the articles that have been put out over the last 20 years or so to see if this is the way it has always been, no matter what is happening in the market. My guess is it has always been this way.  
Chatgpt made what I thought was a good point in saying, ""they put articles like this out, because markets are cyclical , and they know, eventually they will be correct."" If that is true, I find that very disingenuous.  
There have been bull runs that lasted 11 years. From what I looked up, it was 2009 to 2020. I can't say for sure, but my guess is these media companies were putting out doom and gloom articles the entire time.

Still I need to read news on the stock market but I'm growing tired of constantly seeing this stuff. I can ignore the article but I can't ignore the sensationalist leaning headlines.

1nukqbe,investing,"AI is like shit in a candy wrapper. People complain it doesn’t taste sweet, but companies still sell it to people. That is how the AI bubble will burst","Everything made with AI is low quality. I see websites with AI generated photos of people, banks with AI phone consultants, AI influencers, AI ads, AI songs.

All of that is super crap. Ordinary people feel negative about it. No one except the companies that produce and sell this AI crap feels positive about it.

And this is a very simple reason why the AI bubble will crash. Even if AI can imitate people, it creates people with features that are too perfect, so people automatically recognize that these faces are too perfect to be real.

AI is like a gorilla being fooled into believing that a plush teddy bear is another gorilla. Sure, they may get interested for a second, thinking what a weird creature, but as animals and humans we sense something is wrong. We feel this artificiality, and we do not feel positive but negative about it.

It is in human nature to embrace life and connect with life, not artificial humans created by AI. It is a waste of time because humans are a species whose whole life is dedicated to passing on their genes and reproducing. The goal is to find another human and pass on genes.

Spending time with artificial AI that imitates humans is a trick against our nature. We are not wired to connect with artificial things because from an evolutionary and biological standpoint it is a waste of time. Our hormonal system and body physiology are wired for life, reproduction, finding a partner, passing on genes, and then taking care of our offspring. AI is like an enemy because it tricks us into interacting with something that is not alive, which wastes our biology’s time instead of engaging in real human interaction.

Observing real humans, we interact and reproduce. With an artificial toy, we cannot reproduce, and that is a waste of our lives. We do not pass on our genes, and humanity dies out because it was tricked into interacting with AI. That is why humans hate, and will always hate, AI.

AI is against human nature. No matter how productive or accurate AI is, it is still artificial, and we do not want to interact with or see the products of it.

That is the reason the AI bubble will crash. AI generated movies with AI actresses, AI ads, AI models, AI telemarketers, AI assistants, all of these are hated by humans, and humans do not want to interact with them. That is what these greedy companies are overlooking, and that will be the cause of the AI bubble crash. People will not want to use AI.",0,28,2025-09-30 18:15:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nukqbe/ai_is_like_shit_in_a_candy_wrapper_people/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.238531

closest thing I found is PLBY (Playboy). yeah that Playboy. they came back to the market through a SPAC in 2021, stock went crazy for a bit and now it’s literally under 2 bucks. basically feels like a scratch-off ticket. either it dies completely or one random headline and it’s back on the radar.

not telling anyone to buy (do what you want, it’s your money). I just think it’s funny how this is like the one vice industry wall street doesn’t openly mess with even tho it’s probably bigger than half the stuff they pump.

so yeah, what do you guys think:
– would you buy into OnlyFans if it ever listed?
– is PLBY just meme trash now or maybe worth a small gamble?

1nufyxd,investing,"Honeywell, spin off, next General Electric? Opportunity? Division into 3 new companies: Materials, Automation and Aviation.","In 2021, General Electric decided to dismantle its historic conglomerate by dividing it into three autonomous companies: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova and GE HealthCare.

The overall capitalization of the three companies rose to around 474 billion dollars, compared to 290 billion before the split. In other words, the market recognized over 180 billion in additional value thanks to the separation.

Why does this happen? There are three main reasons. First: conglomerates often suffer from a market ""discount"", because investors struggle to give the right value to very different businesses. By separating them, each company becomes more readable and comparable to direct competitors. Second: capital management improves, because each entity can invest without having to compromise with the needs of other divisions. Third: a dedicated board of directors and management can move with greater clarity and accountability.

Let's talk about Honeywell. Today the company is organized into four major areas: Aerospace, Safety and Productivity Solutions, Building Technologies and Energy and Sustainability. Translated into a post-spinoff scenario, we could imagine three companies: Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation (which would combine the first two non-aerospace divisions), and Solstice Advanced Materials, focused on specialty chemistry and decarbonization technologies.

The shareholder letter decided to give 1 share of solstice for each share of Honeywell. The split of the other 2 divisions is expected at the end of 2026.

The Aerospace segment is by far the strongest and represents the main source of revenue. Honeywell supplies avionics, engines and auxiliary systems to giants such as Boeing and Airbus, but also to military aircraft and even future eVTOLs such as those from Joby Aviation. In addition to this, a significant portion comes from after-sales services: maintenance, repairs and overhauls which guarantee recurring flows.

Honeywell Automation, on the other hand, would focus on industrial automation, intelligent warehouses and security solutions. Think of scanners, robotics and voice-picking systems in Amazon warehouses, gas detectors and PPE for industrial workers, or energy and fire management systems for complex buildings such as airports and university campuses.

Finally, Solstice Advanced Materials would represent the “greener” and more futuristic side: CO₂ capture, green hydrogen, advanced battery materials and sustainable chemical solutions. A reality in its own right, with a positioning perfectly in line with the ESG priorities of global investors.

For an investor there are three paths. The first is to buy Honeywell shares now and wait for the split, then deciding whether to keep all the companies or sell the less interesting ones. The second is to wait for the spin-off and bet directly on the most promising horse, which in all likelihood will be Aerospace.

1nue3zp,investing,How Wide is the Valuation Gap for L4 Players?,"I feel like autonomous vehicle is one of the stock market's most expensive and hotly contested sectors. the discussion around pure-play Level 4 tech companies and their true market capitalization is getting fascinating. A recent research note from a major international bank initiated coverage on one of the L4 players, WeRide, with an optimistic outlook. The report set a $20 target price. The bank’s reasonings:  
  
One, global reach. The company holds autonomous driving permits in a reported seven countries. This globalization focus is cited as a significant first-mover advantage, especially in international markets.  
  
Two, valuation logic. The $20 projection wasn't just a number; it was based on a discounted cash flow model. The analyst's conclusion is that the stock is 'undervalued compared to peers'.  
  
This brings up a crucial question for anyone looking at this space:  
  
Is the public market underestimating the commercialization potential and international scaling of these L4 companies? A 96% implied upside suggests the street is pricing in a much slower, tougher rollout than the analyst consensus.  
  
What's everyone's take on this? Does a target like this make you look twice at the L4 space, or do the long time-horizons and high R&D expenses make this kind of target too speculative for your portfolio right now?",1,2,2025-09-30 14:05:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nue3zp/how_wide_is_the_valuation_gap_for_l4_players/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.238682

Oklo announced today that the NRC has accepted for review their Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report under an accelerated timeline. The PDC report usually defines the safety, reliability and performance requirements that will underpin future reactor licensing and design efforts. Because it’s accepted early and ahead of schedule, once approved it can be referenced in future applications- meaning that Oklo won’t have to re-defend those criteria each time, which streamlines licensing and speeds deployment.

They also noted that the NRC accepted the report in just 15 days (versus the typical 30-60 days), and **the NRC expects to issue is draft evaluation by early 2026- about half the usual review time**. Legislation and regulatory modernization efforts are cited as supporting for accelerated licensing pathways.",16,1,2025-09-30 13:43:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nudkn6/oklos_nrc_principal_design_report_accepted_for/,2025-10-03 09:03:27.238700

WFC has even gained 66%! And it's revenue hasn't moved in the last two years!!! (literally sitting at just 82 billion $ from 2023 till now TTM) Why the expected growth if the valuation metrics don't matter?

Looking at their valuation metrics they seem very overvalued. It doesn't appear to be related to an sector/industry hype, because NECB is a regional bank with solid fundamentals, yet it continues to drop without any reason/negative news. Sure I cannot compare a regional bank to worldwide bank like that, but after all we are interested in the value investing when not speculating and I don't see the value in buying 25% profit margin banks with 13-16 PE ratios. How are those banks safer bets compared to NECB with 6 PE ratio, 43% profit margin (double compared to some big banks), higher dividend (around 2 times bigger, as they just 1 month ago released a special dividend not present on the calculations) and many other metrics being better like PB and return on assets.

1nu1dma,investing,Are Municipal Bonds Liquid?,"I have been pondering if Municipal GO Bonds are liquid and why is the buying and selling process so different from other securities, such as ETFs and Stocks. 

Let me explain: I have been trying to buy a few Muni's on Fidelity and while several of the available bonds have an ""Ask"" and a Minimum listed, hardly any had any ""Bids"". Moreover, the couple that had Bids listed next to them had significant spread and when I put a bid that was HIGHER than that was listed, my orders fell through. That means the seller was unwilling to budge and could be sitting on the Munis for a long time. Hence my question about the liquidity of these securities? Or are there better trading platforms where Muni's are traded more ""efficiently"" than Fidelity Brokerage?

Anyone have any light to shed how easy it'll be to get a good price on both buy-side as well as sell-side if I got into these? Appreciate any advice.

I know all about tax benefits, TEY, YTW, Coupons, Call Options, AMT benefits etc etc and have decided I do need to buy Muni's so that's not the issue.

Last traded price = 74.948  
Coupon rate = 3%

Yield to maturity (YTM) = 4.88% *(calculated using ChatGPT)*  
RBA benchmark yields 10 years = 4.297% *(source: RBA)*  
Face value = $100  
  
  
This bond is trading at a **discount** evident by the fact that it is selling below its face value (75<100), and also because the current yield is higher than the coupon rate (when prices go down, it pushes current yield above fixed coupon!).   
The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM   aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%)   
Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,2025-09-30 01:30:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,2025-10-03 09:03:28.457947

I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times.

Majority of my wealth is in US based tech RSU (\~60%) that has been performing above my expectations. Primarily for diversification, I want to bring it down to 30% in the next 6-8 months.

Note: I am intentionally not seeking broad market indices for the next 5-10 years.

I'm planning to divest the 30% in this format:

|ETF|Ticker|Allocation|Reasoning/Alternative|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Russell 1000 Growth UCITS|**R1GR**|50%|Growth focus, similar to SCHG, but less concentrated than the Nasdaq 100.|

|MSCI World ex US UCITS|**EXUS**|10%|Core global diversification (similar to VXUS).|
|Momentum/Small-Cap ETFs|**SPMO/IDMO/AVDV**|25%|Split equally among these 3 for small-cap, momentum, and value exposure. (No good UCITS alternative found).|

1ntxs68,investing,Extending the DCA concept to selling an ETF to buy a stock,"Previously, we had DCA to move periodically from a fixed amount of cash to equity.

When moving from a fixed amount of equity to cash, the equivalent of DCA (dollar sell averaging??) seems to be to sell a constant number of shares periodically. (There have been other posts on that.)

In the first case, you have the cash and can always buy the shares (assume fractional shares are possible.) If you adjust the cash you spend (e.g., via Value cost averaging) you may sometimes not have the cash available.

In the second case, if you sell a variable number of shares to meet a cash point, you may come to a point where you don't have enough shares to make that. If you sell a fixed proportion of the shares, you can always sell.

Now let's throw in another variable. I have an ETF that I am going to sell and a stock I am going to buy. The ETF shares can either be correlated with the stock, or not.

What is the minimum risk strategy for making the transfer?

1. If the two equities are correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.
2. If the two equities are not correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.

1ntwo3a,investing,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

The other question I have is: do you have any suggestions for a young investor trying to maximize growth while staying diversified? For reference: I still live with my parents

1ntrlou,investing,Dividends + Margin Account = Growth machine?,"(TLDR at the end, this is a long post)

So I had an idea, but it feels wildly too good to be true, and before risking my assets into a fool’s errand, I’d like to aggressively stress test it. I welcome all criticism and really want to build a strongman argument for (or against) it before moving forward.

I have been wracking my brain trying to find fault in it, and while I can see some obvious pitfalls, they have yet to convince me **not** to go forward.

First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress.

The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x.

For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max.

This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen).

Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). 

Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. 

All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size).

Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario:

**Aggressive Scenario**

Initial cash: 30k

Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k

This gives me a potential buying power of 590k.



Using 95% of it on day 1 :  560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. 



This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following:



\-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends  = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity).



Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01.

At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable.

And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true.

A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me.



**A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** 

This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) 



**B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.**

Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months.



**C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above**

Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key.



**D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off**

In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore.

And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this?



TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

1ntrf1j,investing,I want to be courageous where my parents were afraid,"Hey everyone,

I’m in my late 20s. My parents worked hard their whole lives but were always too afraid to invest, they kept everything in the bank and missed out on decades of growth. I don’t want to repeat that. I want to be courageous, take calculated risks, and build real wealth over the long term.

Here’s my situation: 
Savings: $35k. 
Goal: Compounding wealth over 15+ years.

I’ve narrowed it down to two ETF strategies:

Option 1 – Aggressive Growth 
75% global stocks (VWRA) 
10% global small caps 
10% bonds 
5% gold

Option 2 – Aggressive Balanced 
65% global stocks (VWRA) 
10% Nasdaq-100 
15% bonds 
10% gold

If you were me, would you go all-in on growth and ride out the storms, or take the balanced path for peace of mind? I want to make it not just for myself, but to break the cycle of fear I grew up around.

1nto9qg,investing,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

1ntlfop,investing,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",0,8,2025-09-29 15:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,2025-10-03 09:03:28.458369
1ntk8nk,investing,Bankrupt/Closed businesses question?,"EDIT: Answer provided almost immediately- thanks! 

I've tried searching for the answer and am not finding it, so I'm hoping someone knows: 

When you invest in an index fund, what happens if one of the company disappears? 
(Eg it goes bankrupt or it closes) 
Especially if it is a higher percentage of the index fund? 

Does it differ if it's a mutual fund vs ETFs? 

Are the companies that compromise the index fund set in stone? 
Do you lose that percentage of your investment, or does it get reallocated into the other companies already in the index fund and the percentages for all get adjusted? 
Does the whole index fund get shut down, and money refunded or lost? 

Or does the manager/s of the index fund, find a different company to sub in for the company that no longer exists? 
Does this still happen if it's a passive fund? 
(Are they already swapping companies in and out if some are performing badly? I haven't been watching the complete makeup of funds I've already invested in to notice if they changed since I bought shares) 

I understand/assume there'd be a huge value loss immediately if this happened eap with large companies, so I'm not asking about the value per se, but what then happens with the fund? 



(I realised a lot of the index funds have the same couple of major companies making up a solid chunk of their allocation. I realise the likelihood of eg Amazon suddenly shutting down is incredibly minimal, and I do realise there are likely legal protections in place to prevent this occurring, but it made me very curious with ""but what if?!!"".

3️⃣ Patience is easier for family offices

➡️ 71% want exposure to men’s major leagues

➡️ Just 19% interested in women’s leagues

1nsgvd0,investing,You are not bullish enough on magnets,"You probably already know that the rare earth mineral **neodymium** is used in humanoid robots and we are expecting billions of these machines in the future.

You likely also know that these magnets are used in advanced aerospace technologies and electric vehicles.

But what you probably didn’t know is that they will play a critical role in the new wave of drone and defence technologies which are due for a massive overhaul.

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term. So although robots will eventually move over to the more sustainable Iron-Nitride magnets, there is still going to be huge near-term demand from advanced military and transport technology.

If we look at expected demand versus supply over the next 10 years, we have a lot to be bullish about. The mineral is up 50% this year, but this is a decade long bet and you are still early for this.

1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,investing,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",157,127,2025-09-27 23:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,2025-10-03 09:03:28.459002

The only option I can find is 'VNGA80', or 'VNGD80', both of which are in EUR. this is my first time investing in my non living currency - and was wondering how much of a risk this is (especially ILS and EUR)?

For some reason i'd feel a bit safer being invested in USD, although I don't have a factual basis for this other than 'gut feeling'. Considering this, I was also thinking about investing 80% in 'VT' (or 'VWRL' once I fully understand the difference), which is in USD, and then finding a suitable bond market ETF to invest the remaining 20% in, in essence, making my own version of VNGA80 that I can adjust the bond / equity ratios along with my risk appetite.

1nryyf3,investing,Considering a new HYSA with better APY,"I currently have a substantial amount of money parked in a Wealthfront HYSA, the majority of which is earmarked for a down payment on a second home in the near (1-2 year) future.

Where I am confused is the disclaimer on Raisin’s end as non-FDIC member; although Western Alliance is an FDIC member, I wonder if the account is ultimately FDIC insured or not?  What would happen if the proverbial shit hits the fan?

1nrvpvd,investing,"HIVE - Underpriced honey compared to IREN, RIOT and every other BTC Miner","I dislike all mining stocks but HIVE is extremely undervalued compared to the competitors which is why I am holding some of the stock.
IREN has been blowing up and is in overvalued territory.


Penny stocks are shares of small companies that typically trade for less than $5 per share and are not listed on major stock exchanges. HIVE is not a penny stock. It is listed on the NASDAQ.

-----
IREN market cap per EH/S is 229M

MARA market cap per EH/S is 102M

HIVE market cap per EH/S is 43M

----


HIVE is adding HPC for AI like all the other miners too.
Currently mining 9 BTC a day and they will be mining 12 a day by the end of the year.
HIVE has a mining margin of 55% because one of their main mining facility is powered by hydro-electric.

----
As of June 30, HIVE had 24.6M in cash and 47.3M in BTC.
On September 26, they should have added around 770 BTC since June 30.

---

HIVE is aiming for 100m annual revenue in HPC by 2026. They also have their BTC mining operations which will be 12 BTC a day. The market is valuing HIVE at 835m as of Sept. 9, 2025.

RIOT is mining 15.4 BTC a day and is worth 8x HIVE who will be mining 12 BTC a day by the end of the year. HIVE already has HPC revenue and increasing HPC capacity while RIOT is starting to implement HPC.

1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",269,139,2025-09-27 10:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,2025-10-03 09:03:28.459186

1nrohh5,investing,Study shows wealthy investors react more strongly to financial stress (but recover confidence faster),"India does a national household survey consisting of 275,000+ responses. A research analyzing these responses found that higher income groups become significantly more pessimistic about current economic conditions during financial market stress, compared to lower income households. However, wealthy households show no increased pessimism about future economic prospects.

This likely reflects greater exposure to financial markets among wealthy households, they feel immediate stress from market volatility but have confidence in their long term financial resilience. I found this bit surprising as I thought people with lesser wealth would be more concerned about it being eroded away than the wealthy folks. 

The study also revealed that currency fluctuations and government debt spreads impact household confidence more than stock market volatility in India, which is the opposite pattern from developed economies where banking sector stress dominates.

1nrnsvc,investing,Any resources about retiring and living off of dividends?,"All of the information out there seems to be oriented towards WITHDRAWING money from your accounts after you retire. The issues are things like sequence of return risk, percentage of withdrawals, increasing your holdings in bonds, all sorts of topics that just don't apply to people like us, who plan to live off our dividends in retirement.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the entire retirement ""industry"" is geared towards this, and not towards living off of dividends. My free advisor at Fidelity is definitely not oriented towards dividend investing, either now, or in retirement.

I feel like there's some information that I'm missing that only applies to dividend investing. Maybe things like switches in your investments to make now to reduce risk, maximizing dividend income safety, how to make sure your portfolio keeps ahead of inflation. I'm pretty sure that there's plenty of other topics that I'm missing.

I lost 80% of my portfolio due to too many call contracts (on another stock that was performing well). I turned $700CAD to $2600USD like a week ago (yes, I'm a poor). I've never earned that much money investing before, and I knew right then there I should just pull half out to lock in the gains, or wait a bit and go back in at an optimal when it has a reasonable dip. Or maybe look at some other stocks.

But no, instead stock started falling further, activated stop limits, price went down, caused more people to sell, activated more limit stops, etc. The stock had been lingering around 9.50 - 10.50 for almost a week - after that huge drop it went down to $7. What's worse is I had a reasonable number of puts (bought too high) and I wanted to get rid of them. Eventually it broke even and I sold it, thinking it would surge back up at any minute.

I was also buying additional calls because their price was so slow, I was sure that there would be at least a mild rally and I'd be able to get maybe 50 - 60% of my money back.

Eventually today it went up to 8.06, and I only had 2 days before expiring. I didn't want to risk holding onto it much longer only for it to fall more. So I sold it and lost $1200USD.

You know what the best part is? It raised 25% immediately the next day after I sold and I would earned over double if I just waited 12 more hours. It went up to like $9.10, and my breakeven was 9.12

1nr97zy,investing,Prophecy-Based Trading Strategy,"It is really simple.

This is about the “Prophet Trading Method,” a true golden tip.

There is a very famous prophet named Baba Vanga, known for an accuracy rate of about 85 percent.

If you read her prophecies carefully, you can see the future direction of humanity.

That is where you begin your reasoning.

Of course, not every prophecy comes true, but the important part is the overall direction they suggest.

You can view prophecy as an indicator of humanity’s general course.

So if you take long positions in sectors that align with that direction, even if you face temporary losses, some stocks will naturally rise over time.

For example, if you study the prophecies closely, you will find hints about breakthroughs in human biotechnology, solar energy, renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, and so on.

On the other hand, investing in directions not mentioned in the prophecies, such as oil or coal, could be considered a foolish choice.

The idea is simple. Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.

I personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.

Recently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.

You can also find Baba Vanga’s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.

If you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.

1nr5v2u,investing,5-6 year glimpse - more than 70% of investments that I sold would have - more than doubled - had I held.,"Hello, I just want to state this for the new guys n' gals.  Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win. (FYI I'm currently down 20% on LIDR, but, I cannot do my job without LIDAR, so for me, the need is there.

1nqrymi,investing,"Is my explanation of how bonds work, correct?","Thank you very much for your help. Very much appreciated!



**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",10,9,2025-09-26 04:24:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.755783
1nqrx0d,investing,Mid term gains to beat ETFs?,"I’ve just started investing and could use some advice on how to allocate my money. Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

Already tried Schwab, they said the only option is an international account.

1nqlo50,investing,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,16,2025-09-25 23:14:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqlo50/spt_sprout_social_no_one_talks_about_it_and_i/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.755930

1nqfbgz,investing,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example.

There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside…

According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks.

Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks.

So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey?

And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return.

1nqcnct,investing,Is Auto-Investing in P2P lending a viable option?,"I’ve been exploring ways to diversify my investment strategy and read about the concept of auto-investing in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending on [https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/](https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/) . Essentially, P2P platforms allow you to automatically invest in consumer loans based on predefined criteria such as loan terms, interest rates, and risk ratings.

One of the key attractions of these platforms is the potential for relatively high returns. Many P2P lending platforms offer average annual returns in the range of 15-18%. While these returns can be appealing, they typically come with a higher risk profile compared to traditional investments, which is something to carefully consider.

To manage risk, many P2P lending platforms offer risk rating systems to evaluate loan originators. These ratings consider factors such as financial stability, legal structure, and transparency. By investing in loans with lower-risk originators, you can reduce the likelihood of defaults, though higher returns often come with higher risk.

A notable feature is the buyback guarantee offered by some platforms. If a loan becomes overdue for a certain period, the platform’s originator repurchases the loan, ensuring the principal and accrued interest are returned to the investor. This buyback provision can offer some peace of mind, but it’s essential to remember that there’s still a risk of delays or defaults, especially in cases where loans are extended multiple times.

Another consideration is the lack of liquidity in most P2P lending platforms. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, you can't sell your investments before they mature unless a secondary market is available. This means that your capital could be tied up for a significant period, potentially reducing flexibility in case you need to access funds quickly.

I’m curious if anyone here has experience using auto-investing in P2P lending. What has been your experience in terms of returns, risk management, and overall performance? Any thoughts on balancing risk and return when using such platforms?",0,2,2025-09-25 17:15:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqcnct/is_autoinvesting_in_p2p_lending_a_viable_option/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756039

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters).

1npzzyt,investing,"Why is a 2% mortgage a ""great"" business for a bank when other investments seem way better?","I'm having trouble understanding the logic of why a bank would lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30-year mortgage at a very low interest rate (say, 2%). As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???



I feel like the real answer involves something deeper. Can anyone explain the real, non-simplified rationale here?",193,391,2025-09-25 07:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npzzyt/why_is_a_2_mortgage_a_great_business_for_a_bank/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756240

I guess I’m wondering if it’s wise to sell your portfolio if shit starts going sideways , ie keep some of your gains, and buy back in after it’s tanked?

1npncdh,investing,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.",746,230,2025-09-24 20:38:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npncdh/be_careful_with_quantum_stocks/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756371
1npm4f4,investing,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",13,8,2025-09-24 19:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756399

Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never.

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

  
So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it.  So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth.  

35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks.

Things I’m considering:
	1.	Adding a Nasdaq ETF or a semiconductor ETF to chase higher returns.
	2.	For Bitcoin, not sure what’s better:
	•	buying through an ETF, or
	•	buying through Revolut and moving it to a cold wallet once I reach around €1,000.
	3.	Starting with Trading 212 (zero commissions) and, once I build a decent amount, either transfer to IBKR (if possible) or sell and rebuy there.

Important note: Cyprus has no capital gains tax on stock sales.

Does this strategy make sense long term? Any traps or details I might be missing?",5,5,2025-09-24 09:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1np7hj2/23_yo_with_250_monthly_to_invest_vwce_bitcoin_and/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756545

I want to invest in international securities.  I opened an account with Interactive broker.  But it does not let me invest in international stocks in the country I want.
My other option is to open an LLC that can then invest using a diff vehicle.

What is the process for setting up an SDIRA LLC that is an investment company?

1noza1w,investing,"Friends suddenly getting into investing, red flag?","I (27M) have been into investing since I was 18. I have friends across different age groups, countries, and financial situations. They work in a wide variety of industries and have very different incomes. Since investing is one of my hobbies, I often bring it up in conversations. Some of my friends invest heavily, some just do the classic “VOO and chill,” and the majority have never cared about investing at all.

In the past six months I have noticed a shift. A lot of those friends who never cared before have suddenly started showing interest. They are watching YouTube videos about finance, and some have even paid for courses on things like evaluating companies and looking at P/E ratios etc.

On one hand I think it is great, financial education is important and learning how to manage money in your 20s and 30s is crucial. On the other hand I have noticed a concerning pattern. Many of them seem very impatient, which is normal for beginners ( I even consider myself beginner after 9 years investing), but they also sound greedy. Instead of starting with safer, long-term strategies like index funds, they are diving straight into riskier plays such as Chinese markets, emerging markets, and individual stocks.

To me this feels like a red flag that people is getting greedy and market is overvalued. I cannot help but think this behavior might be a stronger signal than any market metric.

Has anyone else noticed friends or people around them suddenly getting into investing, impatient and chasing quick gains, while skipping the basics?",0,46,2025-09-24 01:23:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1noza1w/friends_suddenly_getting_into_investing_red_flag/,2025-10-03 09:03:29.756616

2- how would you diversify? Please note: with regards to physical gold/crypto I’m not there yet so looking for other options

3- I’m 46, and not yet ready for bonds

4- I am more a long term investor, I love the set it and forget it approach 

5- Another option is paying off my apartment or paying off some of it. It’s at 5.4% mortgage / had it for 4 years / $450k only out 10% down / it’s value dropped 15% since I bought it / I don’t like it and don’t intend to stay there long / some people talk about paying off mortgages or making extra payments > I know this is a predicament often discussed but maybe in my situation it could be a no brainer, what do you think?

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

Investments into the brokerage account started a month ago. 

ETFs:
1) invested $178,765 into VOO between 576 to 606 price per share. 
* Current balance is about $187,730 with around 9k unrealized gain

2)invested $21,571 into QQQM at about $239 per share 
* Current balance is about $22740 with about $650 unrealized gain 

Individual stocks:
1) Invested about $5k in Google at around $190 a share 
* current balance is about $6500 with around $1500 unrealized gain 
2) Invested about $6300 into UNH between $275 and $300 a share
* current balance is about $7600 with about $1300 in gain 
3) invested $1k in Open Door to gamble a bit. I’m down like $300, since I entered last week and it’s been dipping. Shares bought in between 8.40 and 10.40 

Feedback is appreciated. I’m aware that I’m not very well diversified, esp in the international market as I have nothing for that. I also know that the mag 7 is driving up s&p 500, so I’m quite heavy in tech at this time

Should I rebalance, or does it like safe enough?

1noqbel,investing,Powell Spoke Today – Here’s the Vibe Check,"The economy remains vibrant, but showing some signs of fatigue. Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued.""

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

1nojqy8,investing,S&P 500 Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats vs MSCI World Quality Sector Neutral,"Hello guys,

I have just noticed that there is a new ETF IE000FJJZA01 (since Dec 2024) that tracks S&P 500 Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats.  
Comparing the quality metrics, SP goes for Free Cash Flow metrics (FCF margin = FCF / Revenue; FCF ROIC) and MSCI to standard metrics (ROE and Debt to Equity).

Cash Flow seems more a transparent metric and less manipulated with accruals and so on by the companies when comparing to ROE and others  
Do you have the same perspective?

I am actually building a factor portfolio and I am looking to add one of this in order to reduce a bit the volatility.

Thank you.

1noibvq,investing,Transitioning our ROTH's from a managed brokerage (Ameriprise) to Fidelity...,"Hello all,

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

From what I've seen and heard, Nvidia is solidifying its position, and Oracle is becoming a huge player in the AI cloud.

1) The Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive, with a commitment of up to $100 billion. It feels like Nvidia is locking in its biggest customer and ensuring its dominance.

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

All this new, energy-intensive infrastructure for ""AI factories"" is going to put a huge strain on global energy grids and supply chains. It feels like there are new investment opportunities and risks popping up everywhere.

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",17,1,2025-09-22 22:09:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.943842

1nnytkk,investing,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer’s market.

It’s very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It’s a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald’s, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people’s lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they’ll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn’t a flex anymore, it’s cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that’s worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn’t coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn’t care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn’t even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they’re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.",0,1,2025-09-22 21:14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnytkk/my_predictions_for_2035_what_will_be_a_goldmine/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.943929
1nnyjfw,investing,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully. It feels like the future of investing is moving in this direction, but I am still curious to hear whether others think it should guide decisions directly or simply provide data that we interpret on our own.",0,6,2025-09-22 21:03:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnyjfw/should_we_trust_ai_with_our_investments_researches/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.943938

Minimum ticket size or check size (so you don’t waste time pitching if you’re way outside the band)

Investor types accepted (institutional only, HNW individuals, family offices, sovereign wealth, accredited retail, etc.)

1nnti8f,investing,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. 

Just my opinion would love peoples thoughts.

And is it Smart to Invest in AI now or in a Few Months?,"I can’t wrap my head around AI and how it will impact the future of the Stock Market and investing. AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day. People are starting to use AI more and more in their day to day lives, however many companies are starting to incorporate AI into their systems and software to help make them generate more money. I do believe AI is the “Next Big Thing” when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand. I have a TFSA open (opened January 2024, and I have invested the maximum allocated limit ($7000 CAD a year) I have invested all of the money that is in my TFSA into ETF’s as it is one of the safest ways to invest and watch the money grow rather than depreciate because of inflation.

1nnk8wj,investing,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

1nnfyrl,investing,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

May fortune favour the brave!",13,20,2025-09-22 07:24:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnfyrl/why_ensilica_is_worth_possibly_13x_its_current/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944278
1nnf3pl,investing,NVIDIA and Intel Just Partnered. Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",152,105,2025-09-22 06:30:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnf3pl/nvidia_and_intel_just_partnered_is_this_the_end/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944286

1nne3rb,investing,"In the Trump 2.0 era, the dollar is taking the strain","I’ve been trading for over 7 years now, mainly in Forex and commodities, and what I’m seeing in the markets lately feels very familiar yet different at the same time.

The dollar is under pressure, even as U.S. equities continue to rally. To me, the stock market’s strength looks like a mask, underneath there’s real anxiety about the direction of the world’s largest economy. Policy shifts, global uncertainty, and changing capital flows are all in play.

From my experience, when the dollar strains like this, it creates ripple effects:

Commodities often gain more attention.

Export-heavy companies can benefit while import-heavy ones feel the pain.

Investors start searching for hedges outside of the traditional stock-bond mix.

1nnd9am,investing,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

What do folks think of this analysis? Make sense, or something is missing?",354,146,2025-09-22 04:40:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnd9am/why_gold_is_about_to_take_a_stton_of_power_from/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944362

1nn8s2u,investing,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",31,37,2025-09-22 00:53:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nn8s2u/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944399

1nn2eed,investing,Would you keep 40% of your portfolio in AMZN to avoid capital gains tax?,"I've vested Amazon shares over the years and I sell to cover then leave them in AMZN. I have that portfolio of 100% AMZN, and another one that I actively manage which is about 40% SPY, 20% bonds and gold, and 40% in individual stocks. 

I ran the numbers and, when both portfolios are combined, 40% of my holdings are AMZN. 

My AMZN portfolio is +30% overall. I know I'm overweight in AMZN due to the shares given to me. I want to sell about half of the AMZN shares and put that money into SPY and bonds. 

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares. 

Given the tax implications, what's a sound strategy I should do? Continue holding all AMZN in my one port? Sell a portion and redistribute?

1nmnmh3,investing,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",19,6,2025-09-21 09:34:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944514

My GICs, RRSP and TFSA are long term, regular contributions and forget but I have a few stocks that I put $10-25/pay cheque into just as a bit of a personal attempts at making a bit of profit. It started off with cannabis stocks (I'm Canadian) years ago and I got burnt. Not a huge deal tbh since it was something I considered a bitmof a gamble. But the last year I've actually started to make a bit of profit. 

One for example, a gold mining company is up 84%! The last month it's been hovering around the $30 mark, up from an avg of $17. All indicators and reports I can find are pointing to this being a stable and good buy for the near term.

I'm trying to find guidance on when to sell and when to simply hold for the long term. 

It's not that I need the money right now but it might be nice to pay down some debt or maybe put it onto my mortgage. Or hell even to sell and put the money into a new sub $20 stock and try to grow it from there. 

Thank-you everyone for your time and advice.",0,14,2025-09-21 00:44:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmedzi/when_to_sell_and_what_goes_into_the_choice_to_hold/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944579

Im from europe, Slovakia, 30 yo. Have my own flat payed off and have one inherited that I rent for 500 euro and nett of it is around 300. Don't have any debts nor family to take care of. Net worth of all my assets is around 250k.

In past 5 years I managed to save around 100k eur, just worked and saved everything at 2% account. Plan was to buy some investment property or help my brother and his girl to get lower mortgage for their house, but they split up.

Due to political situation, demographic situation and failing economy I don't see buying property here as good investment. Don't want to deal with tenants in this economy either cause lot of people won't be able to pay rent and I will take the losses. 

So I'm looking for other options. Learned about stocks at school and investing in them individually seems risky, so I started to look into ETFs. 

Investing here in my location to ETF here is pretty new topic, asked AI but I would like to know about real life experiences with ETF and investing, what is your best portfolio, is it safe to invest like 80k, is it possible to get like 500 euro mothly from dividend?

1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",7,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm58pv/opening_discussion_about_rddt/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944676
1nm2vdm,investing,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read??” Let’s bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn’t effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	•	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	•	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

⸻

Company Financial Health: Strong

	•	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•	Cramer likes the stock

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",1,24,2025-09-20 16:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944737

1nm2mck,investing,Taxable brokerage and ideas for early retirement plan,"Hello! My husband and I are in our 40s. We both have pre-tax retirements and contribute 15% each (counting employer matches). We both have Roth IRAs that we have are funding.

The original plan was to max out the Roths then the pre-tax, BUT we might have an opportunity to “retire” early (in our early 50s) and live abroad. The income gap to cover will be lower and so will health insurance and healthcare. We can do our traveling in our 50s and then move back in 7-10 years if we wish to. 

We will have our Roth contributions and probably rent from a property we will have managed while we are gone. However, we will also need 35k or so liquid in savings, and I’m trying to figure out the best taxable brokerage to use. Since this money won’t go to traditional retirement investments, where can we start parking savings and still get some growth? We bank and have a small investment account with So-Fi. Roths are with Edward Jones (I know, but my husband has the bigger one and likes talking to a guy and our 529 for our kid in college is there and mine could be moved). Vanguard? Another?

1nlzp7t,investing,Where to invest at the end of Oct,"My wife and I normally save 4K per month after all retirement, HSA, bills, etc. That fluctuates a little on months we take a big trip but fairly consistent. We have a 6 month emergency fund. 

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks.

How do you decide if/when to sell and move it into something more stable? Or, do you just hold and say your prayers?

But- nuclear stocks tend to be volatile depending on politics and current events. Not to mention the reality that as soon as anything goes wrong with nuclear production (meltdown, etc) it will likely tank the stock prices and be down a long time.

1nltg3d,investing,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

Net Income: -$167 million

I’m 23 and just starting to get serious about financial independence. 

I want to lay out my situation as clearly as possible:

* **Investments:**
   * \~$20k in stock (gifted by my grandpa.)
   * \~$25k invested into a (real estate and hospitality company) by my dad for me
* **Savings:** \~$10k saved myself so far.
* **Lifestyle:** Extremely fortunate right now I don’t pay for rent, food, or major expenses thanks to my dad’s support.
* **Current Status:** Not financially independent, just beginning my career.

My goals:

1. Learn how to best structure these assets (I'm currently learning about all things investing)
2. Build my own path toward FI rather than just coasting on family support.
3. Start creating a system so I can eventually support myself fully while growing wealth.

Any straightforward advice on how to set this up wisely from the beginning? Especially curious what you’d do with the stock + dad’s investment.

1nljtmn,investing,Gold and market discussion,"I am looking to have a discussion with others on here about gold and it's current role and value in the market.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.
2. Current administration is trying to weaken the US Dollar which drives up asset prices, including gold.
3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.
5. Central banks buying up gold.
6. Central banks and investors have slowed purchasing of US treasuries signaling moving away from US assets.

Cons:
1. Gold does not generate income.
2. Possible that inflation does not accelerate.
3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto? 

Anyway, just here for healthy discussion about the market outlook over the next year or two.",4,5,2025-09-20 00:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nljtmn/gold_and_market_discussion/,2025-10-03 09:03:30.944974
1nlg001,investing,India just made REITs way more accessible,"India just made REITs way more accessible - thoughts on this regulatory shift?

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

Anyone with experience in emerging market REITs? Regulatory changes like this usually precede bigger investment waves, but India's property market has its own unique dynamics.

1nlfu0j,investing,What % is considered good above government bonds?,"Hi!

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

1nlcpmw,investing,Market Returns vs Inflation  (Do I have this right?),"Simple question, and I should know this, but asking here:

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

1nkvpz0,investing,How would you invest to benefit from the fall of Visa/mastercard networks?,"I recently learned of the Qris system, a system that doesnt use traditional payment networks and goes through indonesia's central bank and the use of e-wallets, products are purchased via QR codes and it seems to have already expanded to multiple Asian countries. One of the core benefits here is also the fact that the fees are minimal, transactions are instant and its completely independent of VISA/Mastercard networks.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance. And people are also politically motivated to find alternatives due to all the censorship those payment networks are pushing for.

Those systems are cheaper, convenient and independent of american payment networks, this kinda suggests that their takeover is inevitable and eventually the visa/mastercard wont be as relevant.

So if we are to assume the end of the era of visa/mastercard, how would you best prepare for such major change?",25,35,2025-09-19 06:03:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nkvpz0/how_would_you_invest_to_benefit_from_the_fall_of/,2025-10-03 09:03:32.066351
1nkt8n4,investing,Rambus/RMBS closes over 100,"Anyone here from the old Investor Village board?

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.  However, RDRAM was poorly received by both consumers and memory makers due to cost and some technical issues and resistance from the memory makers.

After a series of legal setbacks, failing to win infringement claims, losing an anti-trust lawsuit, and having to face a politically motivated FTC investigation, the stock price crashed and traded in the single digits.

It's been a long, slow recovery.  I think it's safe to say that most investors from that time eventually gave up on the thought that the share price would ever reach 100 again.  So forgive me for being a little  excited, but today represents a landmark for me.  I just hope it can stay above 100 longer than it did before !

I came across this article about a couple who chose to invest in stocks instead of buying a house and they were able to retire within 3 years! Maybe they got lucky, maybe the story is BS. But, should we all start allocating a bigger share of our incomes toward companies that are likely to be on the winning end of the AI transformation?

Co-ownership in 'home' seems like crazy concept to me (imagine the number of problems you would face in decision making!). 

But given this is a vacation/luxury home - whoever is buying these homes as fractional oowners must be doing it as an investment.

Now to their Reg A class D shares offering -->

I saw their news (paid of course) on sites like morningbrew and likes. And since I searched for it afterwards, i now get to see lots of their ads too. 

 Some things I don't like is their PR. They will be like Pacaso secured Nasdaq symbol PCSO but they are not doing IPO. so why worry about getting a name ?? seems gimmicky. or maybe there is a reason.

This is their first public offering. So I am not sure if anyone heard or has invested in it (apparently 11K people so far have invested 55M + - no way to verify this claim apart from their website.

Their VC investors include top names - like Softbank vision fund. But i am wondering why these investor are not investing now and why is Pacaso instead doing a reg A instead and raising from people instead.

Let's say you were gainfully employed at a high paying job and maximized your 23.5k contribution half way through the year.

Then, you take out a 401k loan with a 8% interest rate that you pay back to yourself...

According to Empower, the 401k loan does not result in your funds being taken out of the market - it just adds the debt.

Doesn't this allow you to contribute more than the max contribution into your 401k? The origination fee for the 401k loan at Empower is only 50 dollars...

Currently, I am 57 and will stop working when I'm 60. I have two 401k's (one active and one from an old job) that should have a combined value of about 750k when I stop working.  I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

Right now the two 401ks have a variety of funds within them. The older one is a Gov TSP with C, S and I funds, while my active 401k is mainly Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap ETF's.  Do you think it would be ""easier"" for her in the future to have all our pre-tax money in a single account, spread across a couple stable ETF's vice how it is now?  Also, having never done anything like this before, is it a pretty simple process to transfer 401k balances into an IRA?   

Lastly, I assume that I cant simply bring over the same particular ETF's that I currently use since they are ""company managed"" (not sure if that's the correct terminology)  so would i just liquidate all the funds into cash and then transfer the balance into the IRA and go from there?

1nk32sg,investing,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

I noted she is getting interest from the following investment:

Co-oprative Group Limited 
11% final repayment subordinated notes due 2025

I’ve googled them and I still just don’t understand how they work. It says they are due in December 2025 - what does that mean? 

She holds over 5500 of these notes and their current value is over £100. Surely that can’t mean they’re worth over £500k? I think I’m missing something key here.

1nk15dh,investing,How to protect my mom from inflation?,"My mom is in her mid 60’s and is sitting on about $100k+\- usd from her inheritance. It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

1njurb9,investing,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

Counterparty risk is always a key consideration in any type of project financing, particularly where there is a high reliance on revenue from a single counterparty,"" Moody's analysts wrote on Wednesday.""And in our view, Oracle’s data center build is effectively one of, if not the world’s largest, project financing,"" they added.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I’m seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That’s a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA®) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They’ve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they’re gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that’s had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that’s a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

1njkrvj,investing,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 Basis Points, and projected two more cuts in 2025","This is the first time the Fed has eased rates since last December.

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut. 

Officials signaled the possibility of **two more rate cuts** this year.

1njhk2x,investing,"I usually don’t sell this fast, but after a 57% gain in 5 months in Oil-Dri (ODC) I closed the position. The company’s great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn’t as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a “quiet compounder” hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat’s Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn’t caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year’s inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC’s sales into that sector were up, they’re winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat’s Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail “doors” for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They’re doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The “steal” at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there’s still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I’d rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I’m still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I’ll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

Curious what the sub thinks: do you trim or exit when a small-cap rerates quickly? Anyone else follow ODC or other under-the-radar compounders like this?

I’m concerned that all of these assets look pretty overbought at the moment but the plan is to hold this allocation for a decade.

**Question #1:** What would make more sense:

\- To diversify with gold as a hedge, or 

\- To diversify with a world index ETF to balance exposure across regions and sectors. or 

\- To add more into the QQQ

1njdniq,investing,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

Unless you think I'm underestimating the risk of sticky inflation?",0,8,2025-09-17 13:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njdniq/bubble_worries_have_sparked_my_interest_in_a/,2025-10-03 09:03:32.067138

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

I realize no one here is probably a lawyer, I'm not going to sue you if you're wrong, I just need thoughts and opinions. 

I was on vacation today and I heard someone talking loudly in the public restroom on their phone. They were not necessarily trying to conceal what they were saying.

I walked a little further and saw the name of a company that I believe they probably worked for.

Long story short, what he said on the phone made me think their stock is more likely to go down than up. He said nothing about earnings or projects, just that management of the company very broadly lacked confidence in the company at this point. 

Would it be insider trading if I bought puts on the company stock based on this information?

1niyxh1,investing,Why today’s Nvidia–CoreWeave deal is a red flag for Oracle,"oracle pumped their stock saying ai demand is going to double. key word = *future*. they’re selling investors on what’s coming, not what’s actually happening today.

meanwhile, nvidia just cut a $6.3B deal to backstop coreweave’s unsold gpu capacity through 2032, and another $1.5B leaseback with lambda.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

so oracle’s forecast = hopium about tomorrow.  
nvidia’s actions = reality check today.

1niyk3r,investing,"IONQ and other Quantum stocks are rising insanely, is it worth to invest?","I noticed IONQ's presentation on investors' day, and they shared some information about achieving targets, and also had one slide where they presented the revenue, which is doubling every year. But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|

|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**− US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|

|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

1niqq2t,investing,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I’ve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I’m also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we’re now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I’m ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I’m not savvy enough to know if it’s going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I’ve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I’m betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I’d like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT’s right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in “collapse” stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF’s

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF’s as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.  

Anyone thinking along the same lines?  For those who think my outlook is crazy, how do you think this mix will perform?",0,20,2025-09-16 19:10:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1niqq2t/rate_my_collapse_portfolio/,2025-10-03 09:03:32.067446

1nih5qo,investing,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you’d expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn’t happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released – it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.",0,6,2025-09-16 13:14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nih5qo/defying_the_news_why_do_prices_sometimes_move_in/,2025-10-03 09:03:32.067541

1nifvnr,investing,JetBlue promo - A company saver?,"I know there have been chatters around that JB may go out of business (apparently with 37% probability). But I have a contrarian view. Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

1nid949,investing,"AI Enthusiasm in Stocks: Records Despite Yields,Your Offset Pains?","The recent rise in AI stocks, which has reached record highs, feels like a real struggle. On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you’re significantly up, and the next you’re down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

What do you think about this? Do you believe it's a bubble, or a true long-term trend?",3,3,2025-09-16 09:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nid949/ai_enthusiasm_in_stocks_records_despite/,2025-10-03 09:03:32.067606
1nid8kw,investing,Stop limit sell vs covered calls,"Hi,

What am I missing?

I just started learning about covered calls and I am wondering  If you are planning to sell 100-shares of a stock and you know your strike price, why not sell covered calls instead of stop limit sell? If you are assigned, you will get the premium on top of the total sell of the shares..

One gotcha is that one covered calls contract is 100-shares and covered calls are sold by contracts.

1ni8qzs,investing,"Considering adding some tilt, wanted to hear more feedback","Firstly, here is my current equity portfolio:

* [**VTI**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/) (70%)
* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance.

I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

I'm looking forward to hearing some feedback about my new portfolio, especially if you have also looked into factor tilting before or have already added one or two factors to your portfolio.

1ni8a6a,investing,19m need some advice on my future.,"Hey guys I'm 19, started investing this year I have 8k invested. I did my first year of university but I want to switch my major and drop out of my current university. If I drop out right now I'd only get a 50% refund from my school meaning I need to pay around 1.7k And Id need to pay my 5k loan back on top of that (if I don't drop out I don't need to pay that loan back for another 2 years) 

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job? 

For some reason I'm really worried about my future and confused on what I want to do, but I do know that I want to invest as much money as I can.

1ni43qb,investing,Rate Cut Bets - It's Turning Out to Be a Close race with Cook and Miran in the pole Positions,"It looks like the handicappers had two bits of breaking news tonight. 

First,   cook will not be fired for now [Appeals court declines to let Trump remove Fed Governor Cook](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/appeals-court-declines-to-let-trump-remove-fed-governor-cook/ar-AA1MBYDE?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

That will mean that the odds of a fed rate cut have gone up. Even though the Trump loss on the firing of Cook means that she won't be sidelined, there was really no indication of how she would have voted. On the other hand Miran's opinions on the matter are pretty clear, even if one doesn't think he is a trump lackey. 

However, in both the shorter term and the longer term, it's not clear how things will work out. If the Trump supreme court upholds his right to fire at will which it has done in all the other cases, then he will still be able to stack the deck in short order. (and maybe intimidate the other governors).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in.

1ni0ifz,investing,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,investing,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

2. I get the concept of not “panic selling” and maintaining a diversified portfolio- but is there any harm in reallocating or rebalancing within categories (within large cap, within international, etc)?  Is there a downside?

1nhtsh0,investing,NYT: fewer companies going public because of cumbersome corporate governance rules driven by fear of shareholder lawsuits.,"[The Quiet Force Imperiling Our Booming Stock Market](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/opinion/stock-market-corporate-governance-ipo.html)

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",75,33,2025-09-15 18:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,2025-10-03 09:03:33.198820

1nhomjt,investing,LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk high reward biotech company,"Hello r/investing true to my name I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

Again this is high risk and although my name would lead you to believe I only hold small cap. Majority of my own funds are in diversified ETFs.

1nhmcfe,investing,Thinking About Investing in Silver – What’s Your Take?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I’m wondering: do you guys think silver is a smart play right now?

IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

1nh8zz6,investing,Housing Market to Crash?  …It’s Complicated.,"Since 2021, I’ve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I’m here to say, with incredible confidence, that I’m actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years…at all. BUT I don’t think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I’ve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates… and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem “allowable” if I’m allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let’s start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‘mathing’ to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today’s interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that’s not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here’s why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‘should’ price homes: 
It doesn’t factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven’t. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market’s regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%…ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is “Something has to give”.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?",0,45,2025-09-15 01:37:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nh8zz6/housing_market_to_crash_its_complicated/,2025-10-03 09:03:33.199093

* IUSN has a “high” TER (0.35%) compared to VWCE. Is it worth keeping such a big chunk in small caps?

1ngn9vo,investing,Will the market face a persistent drag as Boomers begin liquidating 401Ks through retirement?,"I have heard that the average return of the S&P over time is 8% annually.  However, never in our history have we had so much market wealth concentrated among middle to upper-class Boomers, who are going to liquidate their holdings as they go through retirement. This is further exacerbated by the polls showing that many Boomers don't intend to leave wealth for their children.

My question is: will this create a new semi-permanent drag on the market, given the sheer magnitude of the 401K withdrawals? Of course I understand that there are more working-age people adding to the 401Ks than senior citizens pulling money out. However, the withdrawals will end up canceling out a substantial proportion of the investments, from what I understand. And it makes me thing that the 8% average growth will be tough to keep up given that pervasive drag.

1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngal7f/amzn_covered_calls_free_money/,2025-10-03 09:03:33.199345

August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

Over the last few decades where the assumption was generally “dollar strong, don’t want foreign currencies dropping to eat the returns of dollars invested internationally” those hedges were essentially a form of downside insurance for exchange rates wiping out returns “from the dollar perspective.”

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?  Or is it just a downside hedge and so even a hedged fund could benefit from the dollar weakening compared to the currency the fund was invested in?",1,6,2025-09-13 16:11:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ng1gl8/question_on_currency_hedged_etfs_or_mutual_funds/,2025-10-03 09:03:33.199421

1nfwv0f,investing,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

1nftshh,investing,Gold DCA at an all-time-high price,"I’ve been dollar cost averaging into physical gold through an auto-invest plan with Summit Metals for a while now. A fixed amount is deducted monthly and accumulated until it buys a full ounce, which is then shipped to me. But with gold hitting all-time highs, I’m rethinking my strategy.

I’m always tempted to dial my monthly amount down as the price rises, effectively buying fewer ounces over time. However, this feels like market timing based on intuition, which goes against the set-and-forget principle of DCA. Is this a foolish impulse?

Is there a systematic way to approach this, perhaps by adjusting my contribution based on a metric like the 200-day moving average? Or is the smarter move to just ignore the noise and keep my automatic contribution exactly the same, trusting the DCA process regardless of the market’s price?

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

1newcvy,investing,Hedged with gold while benefiting from silver and copper: EMX Royalty,"Hedged with gold royalties during rate cuts, while also benefiting from strong copper and silver prices in times of economic expansion, truly a cash cow.

A stock for eternity? For me, yes. I’m invested for the long term: gold provides downside protection, while copper and silver capture the upside in a recovery.

On top of that, the merger with Elemental Altus creates further synergies.

With no heavy costs for plants or large workforces, royalties are not capital-intensive, making this an exceptionally efficient business model.

Personally I think that the policy is better used sooner as inflation is just destroying the dollar. A 3.5million dollar policy 25 years ago was impressive,  it represents much less buying power today, and far less in 10-20years.

I’ve been frustrated with how most stock coverage just recycles the same tickers, while interesting plays highlighted by the retail community don’t get a clean, digestible deep dive. So I started a tiny project called[ OneDailyStock.com](https://onedailystock.com).

The idea is simple: each day it highlights one stock that seems to have strong potential but balanced risk, based on what the retail community is noticing. Today’s pick is Rocket Lab for example, and the writeup goes into the company overview, investment thesis, bull/base/bear cases, key catalysts, sentiment, and a look at earnings and technicals.

1nejleo,investing,Thoughts on ANGX (Angel Studios) as a Long-Term Play?,"As a few of you know, angel Studios, a streaming company went live on the stock market today.

I’ve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it’s newly public, and I’m curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I’m not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10× in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100× companies, but obviously that’s speculation.

Right now, I’m mainly shooting for the 10× potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn’t sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",11,33,2025-09-11 20:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.401217

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

I'm thinking of re-allocating my portfolio so that more of the cash is kept within tax advantaged accounts - specifically my Roth IRA - as otherwise taxes eat away at the interest (I'm in a high bracket).

1ndxhwm,investing,"Do ""Basic Options Strategies"" (Covered Calls, CSPs, Wheel) Really Beat QQQ Long-Term?","Hello everyone, 

I would like to hear some honest, no-holds-barred feedback from experienced and established traders.

My question is this: Over the course of 10+ years, do basic options strategies - specifically selling covered calls, cash-secured puts, or a wheel strategy - actually outperform growth-centric ETFs (i.e., QQQ)?

Everything I find online (especially on YouTube) seems to be very pro-options trading, but many of them that market themselves as coaches, typically are trying to sell you a course. On the other hand, there are guys like Ben Felix (who is a respectable financial planner) who cites research to describe options strategies as entirely irrelevant. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle trying to sort through it all.

For context:

1. I'm not trying to make a buck quickly.
2. I'm trying to establish a sustainable, long-term process.
3. I am fine with some weekly monitoring, I don't want to be checking trades every day.
4. I would options on stock with strong fundamentals and proven track record (no meme stocks, no speculative plays).

I understand that there is some mental capital and operational capital required for options - so I would only apply options if it became apparent the returns over the long-term would be better than only buying and holding on QQQ.

I've been dabbling in CSPs and covered calls over the last month, and the  results look good. Of course, one month of results are meaningless 

 If you’ve traded options this way (or still do), I’d love to hear your experience: Did it genuinely beat buy-and-hold ETFs over the long term?",4,14,2025-09-11 02:39:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ndxhwm/do_basic_options_strategies_covered_calls_csps/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.401613

Our difference of opinion was at the moment of retirement, he felt someone should be fully ""safe"" (i.e., 100% in Fixed Income), but I argued you have another 20+ years of life ahead of you - and you need some continued growth.

1ndr14c,investing,Seagate (STX) – From ESPP discount to 140%+ gain. Did I stumble into gold?,"I started working at Seagate last year and decided to join their ESPP. Basically, employees can buy shares every 6 months at a 15% discount, either off the price at the start or end of the period (whichever is lower). Dividends get reinvested automatically through DRIP.

Last cycle I bought in at $79/share. When the stock hit $164, I asked here if I should sell, and most people said yes since I’d basically doubled my money. Instead, I decided to hold out for long term capital gains and now it’s at $193 and still climbing. For context, that’s higher than Nvidia’s stock price right now ($177 at the time of this post).

If the price stays where it is, by Feb 2026 I’ll have about 46 shares worth ~$9k, after only putting in $5k. And with demand for data storage/data centers only growing, it feels like it could keep rising.

So my question is: did I just get insanely lucky stumbling into this, or is this kind of upside somewhat “normal” with ESPPs when the timing works out?

Now, additional supply from giants like CATL is expected to **break the fragile supply-demand balance**.

I did some investing in 2014 for a year then pulled out of the market because I was still young and didn't have enough assets at the time. I have been back in the market for the last three years. Thankfully I have consistently beaten the market by a good margin but my main worry right now is that I have held a significant proportion of Chinese stocks - mainly because some good companies could be had at bargain prices. I am worried now that I misjudged and that the probability of war is rising to an uncomfortable level ( I don't think it's likely but Im realizing that even the possibility may be too much risk when you factor it into the valuation). My main Chinese holdings are Byd ( largest position by far), Bidu, Baba, and a small recent position in Xpev). What would happen if war starts? Is it time to sell those stocks? I've mostly held these stocks for more than a year.  I would say my risk tolerance is relatively high because I'm young with good income and no kids, but I can't justify holding on to them if there is a real possibility it goes to zero value
 
Having to pay tax before further compounding of those assets is a big negative, especially since I do like some of the companies still - but I am quite worried about the possibility that my hard earned savings will plummet to absolute zero overnight if a major war starts with the west. Is it time to take the painful and bold decision to sell everything Chinese? What about TSMC? Would you treat that the same given the vulnerability there?

1ndb7wx,investing,Is borrowing against crypto a smarter option than taking a bank loan?,"I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately and wanted to hear what others think.

I’m considering borrowing **$**50K against my crypto holdings (roughly $200K total portfolio) instead of going through the traditional route of taking a personal loan or loan from a bank. The idea is to use the funds to diversify into stocks and ETFs, while keeping my crypto exposure intact.

For example Nexo seem to offer relatively low interest rates, and the process is way smoother compared to bank loans no paperwork marathons, no credit checks, just collateral and go. Plus, I'd still hold my crypto and hopefully benefit from future price appreciation.  
But then there’s the liquidation risk. If the market dips hard and my LTV ratio spikes, I could lose some of my assets just to cover the loan. That’s the part that keeps me on edge.

Has anyone here borrowed a similar amount against their crypto?",0,35,2025-09-10 11:08:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ndb7wx/is_borrowing_against_crypto_a_smarter_option_than/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.402214

1nd1mli,investing,Can never wrap my head around why Roth is not ALWAYS better than Traditional 401k,"I am a high income earner as a business owner.  Because it is a S Corp my tax bracket is quite high.  So it is fairly safe to say the chances are better that I see a better tax percentage when I retire than not (of course unless politicians increase it).

What I cannot wrap my head around is why a Roth is still not the better option.  And I have read a lot and I understand the principal...

So let's say I put $10,000 into my traditional 401k and it grows to $100,000 (just using easy math). And the same happens with the 10k in my Roth.  lets just use a 35% tax bracket for example

Traditional $10,000 = 3,500 tax savings = $6,500 in effect of cost to me

Roth is of course $10,000 = $0 tax savings = $10,000 in effect cost to me.

Retirement

Traditional = $100,000 Taxable at lets say 25% = 25,000 tax

Roth = $100,000 Non-Taxable so the original taxable cost of $10,000 remains

  
I understand the argument is if you take the tax savings from the traditional and invest it you see much more growth AND it offsets the Roth.  But.... what if that tax savings is just part of life and it's not necessarily invested?  I dont track my taxable savings from my traditional 401k to ensure I am investing it so I cant guarantee I am.....  Doesnt that make Roth always the better option unless you EXPLICITLY ensure you invest those tax savings?",0,43,2025-09-10 01:49:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nd1mli/can_never_wrap_my_head_around_why_roth_is_not/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.402375

1nclqt0,investing,Volatility: Is it a risk?,"Hello everyone,

  
My investment journey started one year ago. One of the major pillars I had in my mind was that I would not go fully in the markets until I understand what I was about to do. So, I started to read in the Internet, read some books and papers, listen to some podcasts .. It has been an enrichment experience!  
For sure that I don't dominate the area and most of the times I need a confirmation from someone, like ChatGPT or reddit users :)

Soooo, question of the day: does volatility and drawdowns represent risk? My view:  
1) Yes, on a psicological and behaviour perspective. People panic and try to minimize their losses, get out and return to the market later, etc.  
2) No, if you are literate in the topic and absorbed the right ideas. Volatility is nothing, just temporary oscillations that in fact represent opportunities to buy dips.

I have been a bit skeptical about my current portfolio, as I naturally prefer to keep it simple and avoid risky stuff. I started with 100% FTSE All World ETF, and I recently added 15% World Small Cap Value and 15% World Momentum.  
I am not going to lie, but it goes a bit against my initial view of risk avoidence profile and I considered to go back to the initial portfolio or to add some other factors, like Quality and Minimum Volatility ETFs. Well, it happens that now I don't care about volatility.  
  
Just to complete and finish my strategy, I intend to monthly DCA in the underweight ETF in order to keep the right % allocation. I considered also to rebalancing my selling a small % of outperformed ETF and reallocate to another, but it might not be fiscally efficient.  
Before 10years of retirement, I will add short bonds and start to weight it through time.

Thank you. All your hints will dissipate any doubt I might have or contribute to other perspectives I did not consider until now!",11,26,2025-09-09 15:18:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nclqt0/volatility_is_it_a_risk/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.402701

1ncjejf,investing,Day Trading vs Long-Term Investing. What actually works better for retail investors?,"I keep seeing divided opinions on whether retail investors should stick to long-term investing (index funds, blue chips, steady compounding) or try their hand at day trading for quicker gains.

Personally, I have done both.  
During lockdown, when covid was at its peak, I used to do trading with my father. We did some basic trading (inter-day) using fundamentals(P/E ratio etc.) rather than technical indicators. We made some decent gains since we bought when stocks were like at an all time low and were slowly increasing.   
We did it for like 6-8 months and in the meanwhile studied how to read candle sticks and technical indicators and then started intra-day trading. Initially we made tons of losses and almost quit doing it but one day we made around 6% profit in a single day (fluke most probably) and then got addicted to it. And guess what, We lost more than 3x that money the next day as we traded with emotion and not with logic and reasoning.

So i wondered whether intra-day trading is worth it for retail traders and they should stick to long-term or maybe we were just not experienced enough to study the market and it was our short-coming. 

If you guys have tried both then i would love to hear your experience!",0,29,2025-09-09 13:47:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ncjejf/day_trading_vs_longterm_investing_what_actually/,2025-10-03 09:03:34.402800

My partner (26F) and I (26M) are just graduating university in Germany and starting full-time IT jobs in October. 

**Current situation:**

* Savings: me \~6k, her \~8k
* Combined monthly expenses: \~1,100 € (rent, utilities, etc.) + \~400 € food
* Car: lease 250 €/mo, gas 40 €/mo, insurance 787 € every 6 months (service included)
* My computer loan: 153 €/mo until Aug 2026
* Personal spending: \~300 € (me), \~500–550 € (her)

**Income:**

* Until now: 2,500 € net combined
* Starting Oct: 5,600 € net combined
* Plus I own a business with my father abroad → 20–24k €/year net dividends, usually paid once yearly (can also leave it in the business).

**Investments so far:**

* Retirement plan with MetLife: 2,107.5 € every 6 months (invested in Amundi + iShares ETFs – global + emerging markets).
* Goal: Buy a home in our home country in 1–2 years (cost \~400k incl. renovations/garage). Plan is to use business dividends as down payment.

**Our question:**  
From October we’ll be able to save around 3k/month. How much of that should we actually invest, and how?

* Put some/all into something broad like the S&P 500?
* Take more concentrated bets on Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Apple (higher risk but maybe higher return)?

1ncfymv,investing,Income up to 200k this year what should I do with 401k and new Roth IRA,"My income went from about 120k to around >200k recently this year. Up until now I was only putting about 4 percent into my 401k since there was no match yet. I also started a Roth IRA this year and I have a rollover($14k) from a previous Roth 401k. Do I need to take out this year’s contributions from the Roth IRA?

I know at this income it probably makes sense to switch to maxing pre tax 401k for the tax break. At the same time I want to save for a house in the next one to three years so I need to balance long term retirement with short term cash. Should I switch from Roth 401k to Traditional 401k?

I’m also trying to figure out the tax side since my withholdings may not line up perfectly. As both the w-4s were filed as them being my only job. Should I fix that through a W-4 adjustment or just put the extra aside myself in savings and pay it when I file

What’s the smarter move here max the 401k and save the rest for the house or keep the 401k lighter and stack more liquid cash, I’m about 25yrs old.

Do you stick to pure index funds and withdraw when needed?

1nc1p99,investing,Does the lump sum vs DCA calculus change if you are selling equity instead of sitting on cash?,"The research shows that investing a lump sum of cash is usually better than dollar cost averaging from a long term returns point of view, mostly because of having additional time in the market. DCA does reduce volatility and can be comforting psychologically, but I would personally rather just invest a lump sum of cash to maximize my time in the market. 

However, I’ve been wondering if the calculus changes if someone had a large sum of equity in one particular stock, and they then wanted to move that capital to another stock or ETF? My initial instinct is that dollar cost averaging would be psychologically comforting in this situation. If someone was selling 100k of a stock all at once to immediately reinvest in something else, it would seem like this would open you up to big fluctuations in the prices of both holdings. 

Lump sum investing with a pile of cash makes sense because you would otherwise be leaving that money out of the market for longer by DCA. With having to first sell equity by contrast, your money is already in the market whether you sell & buy all at once or do things in increments; it’s a matter of moving money between between different assets. I know that taxes play a role here and would have to be considered. I guess one could theoretically also incur higher commission fees by executing a greater number of trades, rather than one sell and buy order.",3,9,2025-09-08 22:19:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nc1p99/does_the_lump_sum_vs_dca_calculus_change_if_you/,2025-10-03 09:03:35.628531

1nbwis7,investing,"FLNC / NGVT / UAMY - Power, Infrastructure, and Rare Earths","NOTE: Yes, I just posted about Soybeans, but figured to split these things up to make for easier and focused readability.

My market plays for any next leg up in the market over the next 10-15 years are in electricity (production and supply storage+management) as well as rubberized cement compounds (next gen infrastructure products) - I wanted to say that healthcare and eldercare were sectors that should also see gains but with volatility surrounding Medicare/Medicaid and the effect that is having on regional hospitals and nursing homes I think that is looking more and more unlikely - sad as that is.

Lastly, I think Antimony (a rarely thought of metalloid with various uses in industry, military, and medical) is also due for a massive expansion in value even beyond what it has already seen.



**ELECTRICITY CHOICES**


As power needs go up, the storage of electricity will become paramount to keep generation optimal without inducing grid failure - a backup battery system for an entire city to help feed growing Data Centers and Crypto mining will be necessary - stabilize supply and the cost of electricity will come back down. Growing sector and very undervalued. National power grids are currently prone to instability and have to scale back power generation in times of lower demand. I think increasing demand will only bring more volatility to the Grid, especially in Texas. Having Grid-Scale power storage will do a lot to normalize supply and reduce the frequency of rolling blackouts - massively important as crypto mining and data centers draw more and more power.

Vistra (VST)

Benefits directly from power price spikes (especially in Texas ERCOT market).
Diversified portfolio of power generation.


Constellation Energy (CEG) 

Nuclear-heavy fleet with low-cost generation sells into wholesale markets.


**Fluence Energy (FLNC)** <-- huge potential

Grid-scale battery storage. HUGE hole in our infrastructure as currently cities and municipalities don't really use mechanisms that store excess electricity, it is simply lost and the producing elements of the system have to scale-back in times of low demand to prevent grid failure. FLNC would effectively provide city and regional grids with battery backup capacity that could be held to reduce volatility in and have supply in reserve which will also help bring the cost of electricity back down, which is something all entities generally want.


---


Whether centralized or through having homes outfitted with battery backup systems as a standard part of homebuilding going forward, this feels like the direction the grid will have to move in as consumption continues to grow exponentially. An uptick in these companies could also help the lithium recycling sector, which I also think is a massive hole and need in our overall market.


--



**ASPHALT / INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYS**



**Ingevity Corporation (NGVT) [Chart looks amazing]**

Role: Supplies specialty chemicals including rubberized asphalt components.



CRH plc (CRH)

Role: A diversified building materials company, parent of Oldcastle Materials in the U.S., which supplies asphalt and paving services including rubberized versions (e.g., “QuietPave” overlays)


---


I think rubberized asphalt is the future of pavement (reducing noise and sometimes even helping with traction) and this sector has massive room to grow - the mild levels of expansion and contraction will also prevent cracking and potentially lead to longer-term durability of the product - similar to ancient limestone structures which are incredibly durable due to the ability for internal expansion and contraction. There is a stretch of I-5 southbound South of Seattle that uses some materials similar to these and it is by far the smoothest and quietest drive there is. 

I like the potential for infrastructure overhauls to begin incorporating these materials in building and there is a lot of road we need to work on, nationally. Ingevity looks like an incredible long-term buy right now based on its charts.

**ANTIMONY** (both Antimony and Sodium Antimony in particular)


**United States Antimony (UAMY)**


Domestic Antimony mining company - will likely keep production high to lower reliance on Chinese holdings. China has scaled back mining of Antimony which has started to increase its value over time. More tied to mining/industry and prone to downturn WITH THE CAVEAT that it has resilience in times of increased defensive spending.


Perpetua Resources (PPTA)

1nbv7qf,investing,Are Soybeans Ready to Soar? [Idea],"I tend to rotate my exposure to commodities based on where I feel we are in the cycle - think of it kind of like a boxing match only you're boxing the economy.


---
DEFENSIVE STABLE (BLOCK): GOLD AND WHEAT (if you want to hold value or potentially even grow wealth on the way down, these are the assets to do it in,

--
DEFENSIVE  MOMENTUM (COUNTERPUNCH): When entering a downturn, Silver tends to run up alongside gold [does better just before a recession begins], sometimes even more as we are seeing right now. Corn, conversely, does better when exiting defensive momentum [does better as we get confirmation that recession is over and oil demand increases] as it is not only a food staple but also sees an increase in demand when fuel demand increases (Ethanol),

--
OFFENSIVE STABLE (JAB): Platinum and Soybeans. Soy is incredibly versatile in the agro sphere beyond food which helps it in market downturns and lifts it coming out of them. Platinum has a stable demand in technological components like chip making, which see a downturn when the market is doing bad but should see an increase in demand first, potentially alongside Lithium.

--
OFFENSIVE MOMENTUM (HAYMAKER): Lithium and Antimony. Agricultural commodities fall off when the economy is back in full swing, so further allocations into raw metals like Lithium (tech and batteries) as well as Antimony give you the best opportunity to gain now that you have your opening and opportunity to take big swings at your opponent. Antimony can and should see strategic moments of defensive resilience when defense spending is increasing, as well.


----

--
Most signs - to me - point to us wanting to enter a Defensive/Block or Defensive/Momentum, phase of this cycle HOWEVER, I uncovered something on Soybeans that makes me think that we have an opportunity for a ""Jab"" here. The warning being that Agriculture is being brutalized by tariffs and many family farms are on the brink of collapse - BUT - I feel like we should see another agricultural bail out and/or tariff exemptions before this happens.



BACK TO SOYBEANS - They have tended to perform very admirably during recessionary and stagflationary environments in the past and beyond food (constant need) Soy is an extremely flexible crop. THAT BEING SAID, right now Soy is hurting alongside the rest of AG and that hurt has caused a massive falloff in yield.


Thinking about how Supply/Demand economics tend to behave I would like to direct your attention to something called the STOCKS-TO-USE RATIO -- essentially, the lower this number is, the tighter supply is, and any uptick in demand is going to cause the value of the tighter supply to skyrocket.


WHEAT, which I am also watching closely for a rebound, has a fairly low stocks-to-use-ratio of roughly 32% - that means that under current/constant supply, we have enough wheat to last a third of the year without stimulus or an uptick in production. That is actually fairly low by Wheat's standards and signals that it really shouldn't have much lower to go before a rebound.


---
SOYBEANS currently have a stocks-to-use-ratio of roughly 7.2%... SEVEN POINT TWO. THREE WEEKS UNDER NORMAL DEMAND. There is speculation that, counting China, this ratio is closer to maybe 25% but that is still incredibly low. With fairly high market uncertainty right now, anything spooky could trigger an increase in food demands. With an accelerating market, Soy is still needed to make products and biofuels. Even if the economy from this day forward traded sideways in perpetuity, we have three weeks of supply on hand.

With Soybeans, something absolutely has to give and I think we may be incredibly close to an explosion of value.


TODAY, a bushel of soybeans costs $10.27 roughly - the all-time high bushel price was in September 2012 at $17.95 which coincided with a stocks-to-use ratio of 3.9% - I'm interested in what will play out as this sort of ""agricultural squeeze play"" sets in.",0,7,2025-09-08 18:10:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nbv7qf/are_soybeans_ready_to_soar_idea/,2025-10-03 09:03:35.628734

1nbrvwm,investing,Investment Idea: Long LPLA today at $335,"Been a minute since I posted with a lot of valuations stretched at the moment, but just got long LPL following a sharp sell off on Friday (attributed to jobs report but I’d guess an institutional investor sold and that can move the stock since it has a smaller market cap).

My investment thesis:
1. LPL’s current CEO came from UBS and has a background in digital innovation. The company’s revenue and profits have been on a tear since he took the helm and they’ve transformed the business into a leading Wealth Tech platform with a rev share model that is attracting independent broker dealers and advisors onto the platform. This model is both highly durable and highly profitable and creates stickiness in a space where historically there hasn’t been much. 20%+ earnings/revenue growth the past 5 years.
2. The Wealth space is starting to undergo increased consolidation with many advisors retiring in the next several years and LPL has engaged in aggressive M&A and has a strong track record of bringing firms onto the platform
3. UBS has been hemorrhaging advisors after a recent comp change and LPL is likely to be an outsized beneficiary of this, particularly given management’s background.
4. The push into private assets for 401ks/IRAs is going to make advice even more important to retail investors and LPL stands to be at the forefront working with alternative asset managers like Blackstone/Apollo to benefit from assets flowing into private asset classes.
5. The price tanked Friday by 7.5% without any material news, creating a short-term price dislocation
6. On a forward PE basis the company is trading below 20x, meaning it’s “cheaper” than the S&P. The wealth space generates tremendous ROE/ROIC as it’s a capital-light business.

I know very little about investing and have little to no capital aside from pay to pay savings scrounged up that gets used all the time as soon as a surprise expense comes up. 

I would like to super slowly start investing a bit here and there whenever there’s a bit of extra change, seems like something smart to do and learn. Luckily I don’t have a lot of debt. 

Mostly I’d like to use my smartphone and an app to pick where I put a few $ and see it grow a bit to get into the groove of it. 

Is there a good app that anyone could recommend or a link to some guide for people who haven’t started anything yet and just wanna learn how to do these things properly?

I have used to model in the market recently and it is giving quite good results, not upto the level of backtesting but somewhat similar, But i feel like i haven't used it in a large enough timeframe to come to any conclusion.  
Btw my model currently only trades in stocks and not Future and options. It does have a decent enough latency (near 100ms) so i feel like that shouldn't be a deciding factor for my trades.

1nboe8j,investing,Moving from individual stocks to ETFs - best approach?,"Hello!

My background for quick orientation: 

- EU located, (so Roth IRA, 401k etc. Are not applicable for me. I am maxing out the retirement options available in my country though)
- no mortgage or other debts to worry about
- long Horizon (30+ years until retirement)

Last November I inherited decent amount of money that I decided to put into stock market for investing. Ever since, I DCA'd every month, so far 100% into individual stocks, all in US market. It got shaky in April, but after recovery I'm well ahead - I had some misses (BRK.B) but also picked many winners of this year so far - AVGO, ORCL, GOOG etc.

I know, I know, picked top tech stocks in AI craze time in a bullish market and got returns, hardly a difficult achievement. I read a lot of threads here, and recurring wisdom is that beating the market once doesn't mean I will manage to do so every year. Which is why I started thinking about moving some of my assets into ETF's and maybe other more stable instruments so my portfolio is no longer 100% individual stocks.

And now here comes the question I would love to get an advice from more experienced investors - what's the best strategy in my position?

A) keep the winners, let them run wild, cut the losses, sell my misses and move those funds into ETF's?

B) vice versa - realize the gains, move them to ETF's, keep dca'ing losses until they go back into green?

C) Just move all of it, winners or losers?

D) Leave all of them alone, and dca into ETF'S from now on instead?

E) None of the above?

All suggestions would be much appreciated.",1,5,2025-09-08 13:55:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nboe8j/moving_from_individual_stocks_to_etfs_best/,2025-10-03 09:03:35.628906

1nax2f1,investing,My Macro Algo Just Achieved Enlightenment - Time to Short Small-Cap America,"# TL;DR: Ex-hedge fund quant. My global macro system just connected dots that would make Ray Dalio weep. Russell 2000 about to discover gravity exists.

**Quick refresher:** Left institutional trading to build systems that actually understand how the world works instead of retrofitting correlations to justify existence.

# When Algorithms Start Reading Geopolitics Like Poetry

My proprietary macro framework just synthesized global liquidity flows, central bank policy divergence, and emerging market stress indicators into what can only be described as a masterpiece of systematic pessimism. This thing processes everything from Shanghai copper futures to Turkish lira volatility to predict how Kansas-based widget manufacturers are about to get obliterated.

The algorithm doesn't just crunch numbers, it's basically developed intuition about how monetary policy transmission mechanisms interact with supply chain fragmentation. It's like giving Nostradamus access to real-time global financial data and a PhD in complexity theory.

# The Beautiful Chaos Theory of Small-Cap Destruction

Here's what my system figured out that most macro desks miss: small-cap companies are essentially leveraged derivatives on global financial plumbing. When cross-border capital flows exhibit the kind of fractal instability patterns we're seeing now, the Russell 2000 becomes a volatility amplification device for every geopolitical sneeze from Beijing to Brussels.

My multi-dimensional analysis framework identified something fascinating, the correlation structures between US small-caps and global funding markets have shifted into what i call ""synchronized fragility mode."" When the next shoe drops (and my algorithm suggests it's hovering ominously), small-caps won't just decline, they'll cascade.

# Why This Time the Math Actually Matters

The algorithm's game-theoretic modeling shows that current positioning creates reflexive feedback loops where institutional deleveraging becomes self-reinforcing across multiple asset classes simultaneously. It's not just a US story, it's a global liquidity story where small-caps happen to be the most beautiful short expression.

My system processes central bank balance sheet dynamics, commodity flow disruptions, and currency regime instabilities to predict how these macro forces manifest in micro-cap inefficiencies. The Russell 2000 is essentially a leveraged bet on ""everything keeps working smoothly forever"", spoiler alert: it doesn't.

# The Trade That Institutional Committees Would Never Approve

While my former colleagues debate whether to increase their EM allocation by 50 basis points, I'm positioned for the systematic unwind that macro dynamics have been telegraphing for months. No risk committee meetings, no geopolitical briefings, no quarterly letter explaining why global macro actually matters.

Just pure systematic analysis of how monetary policy divergence, supply chain reconfiguration, and credit cycle dynamics create cascading effects in the most vulnerable segments of US equity markets.

# The Enlightenment

The beautiful irony? Leaving institutional constraints didn't just give me better returns, it gave me better perspective. When you're not confined by geographic mandates and sector allocations, you start seeing how everything connects. Small-caps aren't just small-caps, they're the canary in the global financial coal mine.

My algorithm achieved what most macro hedge funds spend billions trying to do: it figured out how to translate global complexity into actionable positioning. And right now, it's screaming that small-cap America is about to learn some hard lessons about global interconnectedness.

**Below is the Trackrecord of this Algo** (performance varies as it is designed to capture global macro dislocations)

1nan0pj,investing,"Considering Vanguard has so many funds, why isn't there an owner operator fund?","Please let me know if I have gotten any numbers incorrect thank you.

Economic planning takes the correct incentives and long term planning. A competitive capitalist system is brutally competitive and it never ceases to amaze me how ""skin in the game"" is so underwhelming talked about in the investing world. For a long time I thought it would be interesting to have an index fund that stripped out all the businesses which aren't owner operated. An index that would only allow businesses that where managed by people who had a significant or their entire wealth in the outcome of the business. Considering how many different types of funds Vanguard offers, I am surprised Vanguard or nobody else is offering this product.

While skin in the game may not be talked about much, some people have done some research on the topic. In fact an investment firm called Horizon Kinetics has a partnership with the Nasdaq in order to manage an owner operated index. The index methodology can be read [here](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/methodology_RCH.pdf). Since 1998, the index has returned %1100 versus the SPYs %630. According to TradingView.

Horizon teamed up with Virtus to create a mutual fund that tracked the index but it has since shut down as far as I can tell. Horizon Kinetics has since created a fund on its own but it is only invested in owner operated companies in Japan!

Solactive has a similar index called the founders index which can be found [here](https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0RUT6). This index isn't focused on skin in the game but is focused on involvement of the companies founder and is market cap weighted instead of Horizons equal weighted index. Their index has returned %300 in 5 years with dividends reinvested relative to the SPYs %100 with dividends not reinvested. Global X, an ETF company, launched an etf to track this index, ticker BOSS, but as far as I can tell the ETF has shut down.

Anyways, this post is just a long winded way of asking, why isn't this a more popular factor? Why is there no funds for ""skin in the game""? Even looking past Vanguard, there are so many different types of passive factor funds out there in ETF and mutual fund land, so the argument that there just isn't market demand for this is hard to believe. Fidelity has a ""Founders Fund"" but in the prospectus, they make it clear it is not a passive factor fund, it is completely discretionary, the only constant being that the founder must be involved somehow.

1nahs5r,investing,Why no Leveraged ETF under 1x?,"There’s been an explosion of leveraged funds of all different types recently, and it’s getting a little ridiculous: There are 1.5x, 2x, 3x, for indexes, sectors, industries, countries, and even individual stocks. Want 2x leverage for Japanese stocks? No problem- EZJ. Want 2x leverage for AAPL? AAPU is for you. And there’s dozens of 2x short ETFs too. But, as far as I can tell, there’s no leveraged funds between 0 and 1x, and I don’t see why. 

The benefit of leveraged funds is obviously higher yields, and the drawback is volatility decay. If the S&P 500 goes up 20$ and then back down 20$, you end up losing money with leverage. With a lower leverage, like .75, the opposite would happen. Instead of volatility decay, you’d have volatility *growth.* Something like this would actually offer upside when the stock market is flat and protect against downside while offering only slightly limiting upside in a bull market. Look at the example below:

Let’s pretend the ABC index is at 100$. It drops 4%, or 4$, then returns to where it was at $100. In this scenario, if I owned 1 share of ABC, I would end up with a 0% gain. I’d start with $100 and have exactly $100 at the end.

Now let’s say I own shares of a .75x leveraged ETF that tracks the ABC index. Let’s call this ETF ABCL. If I own $100 of ABCL, then when ABC drops by 4%, ABCL would drop 3%. I’d have 97$. But when ABC goes back up 4$, it actually grows by 4.17%. Therefore, ABCL would grow by 3.13%, which gives a total of $100.04, which is .04% above the underlying. Yeah, that’s not much, but in a flat market that’s at least something. If the market stays relatively flat over a 6-month period, those fractions of a percent would add up. Plus, there’s the downside protection. If an index drops 40% and returns to its previous high, .75x leverage puts you back at 105% at a minimum. There’s serious money to be made for anyone who can predict a big downturn.

I’ve done a bit amount of digging, and there doesn’t seem to be anything like this. Why not?",0,28,2025-09-07 02:31:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nahs5r/why_no_leveraged_etf_under_1x/,2025-10-03 09:03:35.629228

1nacxzm,investing,"At 41, I'm just starting to comprehend investing.","I am really enjoying learning about all of this.

For context, I'm a physician and my wife is a professor. She started working at age 26 and has had a couple of retirement funds through old jobs, though we didn't really focus on them and I think just put enough in them to get the employer match. I started working around age 34.

We've been maxing out our retirement plans since 2018 and put it all in Life Cycle funds. I didn't know that I had any other option. I JUST learned on Thursday that I could invest that money in ETFs if I want. I just had no clue. I've also had our ""emergency fund"" sitting in a savings account getting 0.25% :(

The other day I was looking at all of our retirement accounts -- my wife has 2 from previous jobs, 1 with her current job, and I have 2 with my current jobs -- and the balance is a little over $1m. 

Which is exciting as someone who didn't really grow up with much, but also a little disappointing now that I'm learning that I could have been doing a lot better.

I'm starting to rebalance the accounts to be more aggressive. We're both 25ish years away from retirement, so I want to see it grow as much as possible. It's like being handed a million dollars and being told to go nuts.

I don't really know the point of this thread other than to say how exciting it is for me to finally understand what I COULD be doing with my money other than just having it sit in the Life Cycle funds and I look forward to learning more

Healthcare +31 ▲ rising (but below average)

Federal Government –15 ▼ continued decline

Mining/Oil/Gas –6 ▼ flat after 12 months

Wholesale Trade –12 ▼ down 32,000 since May

Manufacturing –12 ▼ down 78,000 YOY

If the Fed still maintains its professionalism, it should realize that the industries hit hardest in this NFP report wouldn’t benefit at all from a rate cut.

Manufacturing: the primary target of tariffs, costly imported materials have destroyed its competitiveness, cutting rates to zero wouldn’t help

Wholesale Trade: pricing has lost its anchor + weighing whether to absorb costs + Trump could add new tariffs at any time = a completely unpredictable policy outlook that keeps employers from hiring

Federal Government: government fiscal allocation issues

* Diverging macro data, with some leading indicators pointing to downside risks.
* Uncertainty around the path of interest rates and inflation.

She has the following: 

$1.7M in a traditional IRA in FSKAX. 

$33k in Roth IRA in FSKAX

$240k in brokerage in FSKAX

$157k in CDs

$575k in IRA

$500k in brokerage

2.Central bank credibility -The Federal Reserve’s independence underpins confidence in monetary policy.

If BLS data were questioned, investors and policymakers would have difficulty accurately assessing the economy. Misleading metrics could cause fiscal and monetary policy to deviate from actual needs.

If the Fed were perceived as losing independence -for example, under political pressure - interest rate policy, inflation targeting, and bond market stability could all be affected. Markets might price in higher risk premiums, volatility could rise, and long-term planning would become more uncertain.

Overall, such scenarios could reduce confidence in U.S. financial markets and the dollar, making investors more cautious.

1n9hall,investing,"18yo, with Bank of America SafeBalance thinking about switching to a better bank for HYSA + credit card. Also want to invest","Hi everyone,

I’m 18 and currently a freshman in community college. I have a Bank of America SafeBalance checking account for 4 years, but I’ve realized their savings APY is really low. I was considering opening a high-yield savings account and also getting my first credit card to start building credit.

For context: 
I receive about $7k per semester from FAFSA and scholarships. 

I don’t really have a use for that money right now since my tuition is basically free, and I live at home. 

My parents are covering my living expenses   
until I’m stable.

I don’t have a job as I study full time but with the little time I have I make a little side income by buying from liquidation stores and reselling which gets me about 200-400$per week but not a 100% stable method

Because of that, I’d like to: 

1.	Open a high-yield savings account.

2.	Get a starter credit card to begin building credit responsibly. 

3.	Start investing some money either in stocks or something to allow it grow over time 

My main questions are: 

1. Should I stay with Bank of America or close my account and open a new checking account with a bank with a better high-yield savings account? 

2. What’s a good first student credit card for someone with no credit history? 

3. What’s the best way to start investing at my age

1n9es3n,investing,Where to Prioritize Time in Market?,"Hi all, I am thinking about how I will evolve my investment strategy in 2026 and I was hoping to get some advice here. I know that the more time in the market the better chance of growth (I am primarily invested in broad ETFs so safer investments with opportunity to grow). 

I have three main places where I am investing: Roth IRA, 401k, and taxable brokerage. I will be able to max out both my Roth IRA and my 401k in 2026. From a timing perspective does it make sense to fund one of these three accounts more aggressively at the beginning of the year, or just find a rate that is constant for all three accounts?

For example I could in the first few months of the year I could more heavily invest in my 401k (max it out with the exception of the amount to maximize my employer match for the rest of the year) and then put more into my Roth IRA and brokerage account for the rest of the year. Or I could max out my Roth IRA near the beginning of the year and not contribute to my brokerage account until after it is maxed.

Am I over thinking this? Should I just contribute $24,500/12 to my 401k each month, $7,000/12 to my Roth IRA each month, and TBD/12 to my brokerage account each month to keep things simpler?

# ""Campine achieves record revenue and profit in first half of 2025""

*Regulated information – September 1nd 2025– 08:00*

Campine, Belgian specialty chemicals and metal recycling company, has reported exceptionally

strong growth in the first half of 2025. **Revenue more than doubled to €384 million**, compared

with €169 million in the same period last year. **EBITDA nearly tripled to €53.4 million**, setting a

**new record** for the first six months. This profit increase is largely driven by strong demand for

antimony trioxide (ATO) and significant rises in antimony prices.

# Results performance per division/segment

Specialty Chemicals division

Market and Operations

Revenue for the Specialty Chemicals division rose to **€293 million, four times higher than in 2024**

(€74 million). Growth was primarily driven by antimony trioxide sales, with Campine becoming the

**global market leader** following Chinese export restrictions at the end of 2024. The FRMB unit

(flame-retardant masterbatches) more than doubled its revenue thanks to the use of ATO, while

CrP (PP recycling) achieved a 30% revenue increase, partly due to competitor bankruptcies.

EBITDA in Specialty Chemicals rose from €6.0 million to €36.6 million.

# Outlook full year 2025

Campine expects a record year, with EBITDA likely exceeding €80 million. CEO De Vos

commented: “Forecasting remains challenging in such a volatile market. Changes in Chinese

export restrictions or U.S. import regulations could quickly impact results. Nevertheless, 2025 is

already shaping up to be an exceptional year.”

In Specialty Chemicals, high profitability is expected to continue in the second half, despite a

slight global decline in ATO demand due to substitution of ATO as flame retardant. The Circular

Metals division continues to benefit from lower battery scrap costs, offsetting lower LME sales

prices.

**Campine is also awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition of three French Ecobat factories,**

**with the deal potentially closing in September. This acquisition could further impact the 2025**

**results.""**

1n96la8,investing,Looks like Warren Buffett proved it was time for him to retire,"Just was noticing AAPL is having a good run and thought I'd look and see what price it was when BRK sold. For reference, AAPL is trading at $240 this morning, Buffett sold at $190-$200. So basically, BRK gave up a 25% gain so they could buy more 5% treasuries? Yikes.

Buffett looked like a genius in April when the tariff's first hit but for the past 6 months the S&P 500 has beat BRK 10-to-1. He's still slightly ahead of the S&P 500 YTD but over the past 12 months the S&P 500 is up 18% compared to 9% for BRK. What's interesting is BRK actually had a good run against the S&P 500 for several years, which was largely timed along his ownership of AAPL.

I understand a conglomerate like BRK sitting on cash is not necessarily the same as ""timing the market"" like us regular joes. But Warren said for years there were no good deals, while the market has continued to say otherwise.

EDIT - I'm getting a lot of grief over this. But if you look at what WB has said in the recent past, what he did with AAPL goes against the grain of what has made BRK successful. In 2021 after selling his airline positions at a loss Buffet said ""When we sell something, very often it’s going to be our entire stake: We don’t trim positions. That’s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We’re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%. If we like a business, we’re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,” he added. “And when we change our mind we don’t take half measures.” Again that quote wasn't from the 80's, that was 4 years ago.",0,36,2025-09-05 14:20:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n96la8/looks_like_warren_buffett_proved_it_was_time_for/,2025-10-03 09:03:35.629849

1n94bfs,investing,Long-term investing with ETF 3x Daily Leveraged,"Hey, I see everywhere that leveraged ETFs are not recommended for long-term investment but only for trading. However, when I look at the historical performance over the last 10 years of the S&P and Gold, I see that gold went up by 633% and the S&P by 760%: they completely outperformed the normal versions (202% and 208%). So I'm seriously thinking about putting 1/4 or 1/2 of what I have in gold and the S&P into 3× leveraged ETFs. Does that make sense to you? Am I making a mistake?

EDIT: Ok i understood the problem, to be simple: yes that can go very high quickly, but in case of crisis, it can go to almost 0 and so all the next gain are negligible.

1n8r3v5,investing,Dimensional Fund Advisors vs Avantis Factor Tilted ETFs,"For investors interested in a factor tilted portfolio, these two funds seem to be the names that consistently pop up. While it’s not challenging to obtain exposure to a small-cap or value oriented portfolio, having exposure to more than 1 or 2 factors in a single ETF is hard to find outside of these funds. I’ve been debating between which of the two asset managers to go with. 

Avantis factor tilted ETFs seem to offer slightly more competitive MERs (AVUV 0.25% vs DFSV 0.30%, AVDV 0.36% vs DISV 0.42%). Avantis is also slightly more aggressive in their in their tilts toward small-cap, value, profitability, and low investment. I’m not aware of either of them targeting momentum, although I understand that they try to avoid the pitfalls of index tracked ETF rebalancing. I also understand that Avantis is more flexible with their criteria and includes highly profitable stocks in its SVC even if they aren’t true “value” stocks, while DFA is more purist. DFA and their products have been around for longer and have higher AUM, although these earlier products were mutual funds. I have to credit Avantis with bringing their ETFs to the market first, with DFA mutual funds previously only being available through institutions/advisors. I’m sure Avantis played a role in DFA eventually launching their own subsequent ETFs. 

While I’m interested in the differences in approaches by these two firms, I’m also more practically interested in deciding which of the two asset managers to go with for factor tilted ETFs. I know that one cannot really go wrong with either fund, but the lower MERs and more aggressive factor tilt have me leaning towards Avantis (AVUV & AVDV) over DFA (DFSV & DISV). Would appreciate any thoughts or to know if I’m missing anything in my analysis.",16,17,2025-09-05 00:36:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n8r3v5/dimensional_fund_advisors_vs_avantis_factor/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.876481

1n8n0hk,investing,Dole: Legacy Owner Sale offers a rare 10% off sale event,"$DOLE is currently on a 10% off sale for a non-fundamental reason (a legacy owner unloading all its shares)

The legacy owner (David Murdock, \~13% equity owner) passed away in June 2025 at age 102, and it announced a secondary offering at $13.25 this morning (10% discount to 9/3 closing price). The market responded with a 10% decline today.

David Murdock (and his family) have no role whatsoever in the business and have long expressed their intent to exit. The sale is taking place right after his passing, timed for a step-up cost basis (tax management) for his heirs.

This is a classic 'fake insider' sale that carries negative sentiment, but means little to the business fundamentals. fwiw, McCann family(Chairman) owns 7.7% equity, and hasn't sold a share.

For a short-term trade, I expect the market to recover to its level of 9/3 (\~$14.7).

1n8f7af,investing,"Rotating to income once it's time to retire, how do you do that?","Hey guys, this is something that's been nagging at the back of my mind for a while and I'm hoping someone here might be able to shed some light on how this works. 

My current investing plan feels pretty common: while I am young I'm investing heavily into diversified growth ETFs and other riskier assets with the goal of better gains over the next 20-30 years. Then, when it's time to retire I'd rotate my investments into income paying assets like bonds and dividend stocks/ETFs .

My question and confusion on this is how do you do that rotation without having to pay an arm and a leg in long term capital gains taxes? 

For example, let's say I have a portfolio of $3M at the end of my investment journey. I've been investing for 20 years and I stopped buying new assets 13 months ago so everything in my portfolio is long term capital gains. Let's say $500k of that $3m is my money and $2.5M is long term capital gains. 

If I sell $2.5M of profit in VOO and buy SCHD, when tax time comes around I need to pay (roughly) $450,657.50 in taxes, meaning I only have $2.5M left in assets. I've lost a huge chunk of that next egg. 

This feels like the wrong way to do this, as a huge chunk of the money you've made is lost to taxes. What am I missing here? Is rotating into income not the move? Do I have to do it slowly over time to take advantage of some of the lower tax rates at earlier LTCG volumes? Do I have to choose to be a dividend investor now and forego larger gains now but make up for it in lower taxes later?

I know we all have to pay taxes one way or another, but yeeting 1/6th of my portfolio to taxes makes me feel like I'm probably missing something critically important.",23,37,2025-09-04 16:38:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n8f7af/rotating_to_income_once_its_time_to_retire_how_do/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.876611
1n8f60c,investing,"Holding VOO as a Core, Supplementing with SCHD","VOO works well as a long-term core holding-t’s low cost, broad-based, and provides full exposure to the S&P 500. There’s little reason to replace or reduce it if the goal is broad market growth.

For investors who want to add a dividend tilt, a more practical approach is to supplement with something like SCHD rather than switching out of VOO. This way, you preserve broad exposure while gradually incorporating more mature, dividend-paying companies.

In practice, VOO can remain the “core” allocation, while SCHD can be built up slowly with new contributions as a smaller satellite position. This balances long-term market growth with a layer of dividend stability, without triggering unnecessary taxes or overcomplicating the portfolio.",11,16,2025-09-04 16:37:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n8f60c/holding_voo_as_a_core_supplementing_with_schd/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.876626
1n8eyqa,investing,SPY and its over reliance on IT.,"Hey there. I've been recently investing in SPY, previously i just picked stocks and tried to get a balanced portfolio (leaning towards IT). If you look SPY's weight by sector, is at least 30% IT, which i dont like.

I do think there is a hype in AI with both ignorant (in the good way) investors and CEOs just looking for money (Altman) or justifying investment in something that MAY pay off in a way they dont even know how to capitalize other than ""will change everything"". We are like what, 3 years down the road and nothing truly revolutionary has happened. I think yes, we do use AI in many things, but nothing groundbreaking such as Google's search algorithm that made it a powerhouse.

I'm wondering if in this context is wise just to sell off my SPY holdings and invest in a more balanced way in Industry specific ETFs (my broker here in Argentina offers a ""pack"" where it picks 12 industry specific ETFs, including IT, in a balanced fashion, no sector going above 15%). That way i'd have a say in how i want to balance my ETF porfolio by just selling and buying specific ETFs to adjust to the juncture.

1n8ber2,investing,Retirement portfolio - what your portfolio looks like?,"So I have a year or two from retirement and am running a few scenarios. Such as what a mixed bucket growth/dividend/bucket could look like. 

But for the growth / sell your stocks and put into the 2-3 yr bond bucket (or other approaches). What do you do in your portfolio?

As an example I might have have 80 / 20 (growth / bond bucket) :

* 40% VOO - core

* 30% - SPMO - momentum/ aggressive 

* 30% - VONG - mid cap / slightly less tech heavy could mix with AVUV. 

* 10% - international & long term prospective bucket. 

The above could be what is inside the 80% of the portfolio, and the remaining 20% is a SGOV / BND that has a 3 year expenses covered to draw from so I can avoid selling in a bad downturn. 

I know total returns is important and I want to compare side by side a dividend strategy vs a few growth / sell stocks strategy and see what makes sense with specific stocks. 

For those ALREADY in retirement. What does your portfolio look like and what is in it? How do you approach it?  This is for a taxable brokerage.",1,9,2025-09-04 14:16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n8ber2/retirement_portfolio_what_your_portfolio_looks/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.876687
1n8bdut,investing,Emotions Interferring with Investment Decision,"I could use some input.  I am 56 and have a nice portfolio (>5M).  Sold a second home and got about $650k to invest.  Advisor says to rebalance to 75/25 (stocks to bond ratio) I would need to put about $450k into bonds and rest to stocks.  I am closer to 80/20 now.  I know for my age, 75/25 is still considered aggressive, but I feel bonds returns are poor compared to stocks and I am having a difficult time re-balancing by putting 450k to bonds.  I consider bonds to have bad returns, so I guess it is greed that is the interfering emotion, but also logical to not invest in 'things' that get poor returns.

One of my larger bond fund holdings is VANGUARD TOTAL BOND MARKET INDEX and the returns are dismal.  1 year and 3 year are 3% and the 10 year is 1.8% while the 5 years is basically zero.  Honestly, that is losing money compared to inflation, which is just a hard no for me.

I can't resolve the conflict (emotional or logical) between bad bond returns and what the experts say is a better ratio.  Then I worry that an insufficient stock to bond ratio is going to come back and bite me when I retire which will be closer to 60 years old.

I can't be the only one who struggles with advice to invest in bonds in view of the terrible bond returns.

1n8593p,investing,Public Benefit Corps in Real Estate - found one actually generating returns while solving affordable housing,"Always interested in impact investing, but most ""do good"" investments have terrible returns. Been researching public benefit corporations in real estate.



Found Padsplit, which does affordable workforce housing while giving property owners 2x traditional returns. They focus on essential workers making under 80% area's median income. The model works because it addresses a real market inefficiency - huge unmet demand that traditional developers often ignore.



Looking at the numbers, properties average 15-20% returns vs 7-10% for traditional rentals in the same neighborhoods. Lower vacancy, multiple income streams per property, and weekly payments reduce risk. Social impact is measurable, too - residents save hundreds per month and can build credit through payment reporting.



For anyone wanting investments that generate alpha while creating a positive impact, this space is worth checking out. Not charity - actual business model innovation. The housing crisis won't be solved by the government or traditional developers.

I'm a non-US expat here in Saudi Arabia and my employer is offering a retirement savings plan with Zurich. I'm making a decent income (~$15k/month) and I'm looking to put away $3k-$5k a month for the long term.
I've been doing my due diligence and I feel like I'm getting a really good deal, but after reading so many horror stories online about other expat plans, I'm getting nervous. Is this a classic ""too good to be true"" situation? 😬
Here’s what I know about the plan so far:
 * No early surrender penalties! My advisor confirmed in writing that I can stop contributions or even pull out my money at any time without a penalty. This sounds amazing.
 * 100% of my money gets invested immediately. No initial ""commission period"" where a chunk of my cash disappears. 🤯
 * The annual fee for the default fund (L&G Diversified USD Fund) is only 0.18%. This seems incredibly low.
 * There's a small fixed admin fee of $30.75 per month.

I know many of you have strong opinions on plans like Zurich Vista or Futura, but this one seems completely different. Am I missing something huge here? Is there a hidden cost or a clause I might be overlooking?

In addition, I have three rental properties that are mortgaged (tenants paying) and I have equity in those of about $650k. The mortgage balances are 960K and I intend to keep them mortgaged and take cash out as I refinance as it's non taxable. I don't have anything invested in fixed income (other than than private debt funds) because I feel like my real estate investments are similar to fixed income. My average ROI right now on the rental properties is about 6%. If I sold the rental properties I would have to pay about $200 in taxes/depreciation recapture so my ""true"" equity is about $450.

If you take my real estate holdings into account, my allocation is

30% rental real estate

46% public equity

12% private equity

12% private debt  
OK thank you for reading this VERY long post and if you have any thoughts about shifting my allocation as I go forward, please let me know.

1n7dcs8,investing,Vanguard and Blackrock: interesting 10 year outlook,"Vanguard

Vanguard doesn’t think U.S. equities can repeat the last decade’s dominance. Valuations and profit margins are already stretched, leaving little room for another runaway cycle. Their 10-year base case is low single-digit returns for U.S. stocks, versus mid-single-digit returns for developed markets outside the U.S. The reasoning is pretty simple: international equities are cheaper, they pay higher dividends, and if the dollar weakens, that adds another tailwind. Put together, Vanguard expects ex-U.S. to have the upper hand over the next decade.

BlackRock

BlackRock draws a harder line between short-term and long-term positioning. Over the next couple of years, they’re still overweight the U.S and for good reason. American companies dominate AI, earnings momentum is stronger than peers, and the U.S. system is better at scaling new technologies. That’s why they see the U.S. as the clearer near-term bet.

 But their broader 2025 outlook is less about business cycles and more about what they call “mega-forces”: AI, climate transition, geopolitics, demographics, and digitization. 

These are structural shifts that shape where capital flows and which regions come out ahead. When they zoom out to 10-year assumptions, the math flips. They see higher expected returns from non-U.S. equities, both developed and emerging, than from U.S. large caps, largely due to cheaper valuations and better yields abroad.

 In practice, this creates a paradox-lean into the U.S. today, but build portfolios expecting international markets to take the lead over the decade.

Personally I'm still overweight US but I am monitoring ex-us funds too, in particular EU and Japan/China",165,95,2025-09-03 12:24:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n7dcs8/vanguard_and_blackrock_interesting_10_year_outlook/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.877038
1n7cslu,investing,Extending ROTH IRA to illimited contributions for local investments,"To make this clear, this idea would not work in strong economies like USA's as local investments are already prioritized. I imagined this idea based on Canada's economy so you could apply it to any ~2 trillions economy.

Imagine if citizens could invest without any annual contribution limit in companies based in their own country through a ROTH-like account. This policy could provide multiple benefits:
	1.	Stimulate the local economy – Investments go directly into domestic companies, creating jobs, boosting consumption, and supporting innovation.
	2.	Indirect tax revenue for the government – Even if gains are tax-free for individuals, the state still collects taxes through corporate profits, employee income taxes, and sales taxes.
	3.	Encourage long-term investment – Citizens benefit from compound growth, building wealth over time while supporting their own economy.
	4.	Strategic national advantage – Prioritizing local companies strengthens technological and industrial sovereignty, reducing dependency on foreign capital.

Yes, investing locally might yield slightly lower financial returns than investing abroad, but the combined societal, economic, and strategic benefits could outweigh the short-term profit difference.",0,4,2025-09-03 11:57:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n7cslu/extending_roth_ira_to_illimited_contributions_for/,2025-10-03 09:03:36.877059

1nwls1l,stocks,Fitness Revolution Investment Thesis,"I'm of the belief that a health revolution is gripping the young population of America and other developing nations, with people becoming far more conscious than generations past of what they put into their bodies as well as what physical exercise they perform. I think this is driven by a few different factors (in no particular order):

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.

2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.

3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.

4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.

You always hear ""supply and demand"". And sure, that kinda makes sense. But I still don't really understand it. Who decides that the right price at this moment right now is X amount of dollars, based on those factors?

For example the real estate market is also driven by supply and demand. Still I can buy or sell a house at any imaginable price, if I find a buyer/seller. And chances are high the house won't go for the exact ""market value"". This is also possible with less unique items like cars, jewelry or electronics (or really anything). There may be an average price for bananas. But still every store won't be the same.

How is the price determined? I'd guess it's some algorithm.
But even then, why can't I sell my stock at half the market price if I feel like it (I can make an order to sell once it reaches that point.

1nwecat,stocks,NVIDIA is climbing again could this be the real long-term bet?,"I’ve been following Tesla and NVIDIA closely, and honestly, the contrast between the two couldn’t be more fascinating.

Tesla just reported a massive milestone: **497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3**. That’s not just growth  it’s a record that shows how strong demand still is. Yet the stock dropped about –4% in the session, which makes me think the market is reacting more to sentiment and macro noise than to the fundamentals. Tesla remains polarizing: some call it the future of EVs, others still see a bubble.

But **NVIDIA** feels different. The stock popped **+3 to 4%** on news it will resume AI chip sales to China after the U.S. eased restrictions. That’s huge. Add to that the steady wave of institutional inflows, and it’s clear that big money is doubling down on AI. The narrative is powerful, the fundamentals are strong, and global demand is only accelerating.

As a trader, I see two clear paths:

* **Play Tesla short term**, with leverage for example through RWA Index Perpetual Futures  which let you trade tokenized stocks. I think platforms like Bitget offer that now.
* Or lean into NVIDIA long term, riding the unstoppable momentum around AI.

1nw29np,stocks,Tesla gears up for Q3 deliveries… while Musk buys $1B in shares and Robotaxis expand,"Tesla is set to report Q3 deliveries on October 2, and analysts are raising expectations. William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  
  
At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  
  
That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.  
  
Across Wall Street, Tesla holds a consensus “Hold” rating, with 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and 8 Sells, and an average target of $346.57 (around 22% downside from current levels).  
  
Position disclosure: I currently hold a TSLA futures position on Bitget. I took the trade after Musk’s share purchase and the Robotaxi expansion news, and it has been profitable so far.  
  
What strikes me is the tension here: on one hand, bullish catalysts like stronger deliveries, Musk’s buy, and the Robotaxi rollout; on the other, valuation risks and Q4 margin concerns.  
  
Question to the sub: Do you think Tesla’s Q3 deliveries and Musk’s $1B purchase will be enough to support the stock at these valuation levels, or are we looking at a potential correction in Q4?",0,35,2025-10-02 12:22:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nw29np/tesla_gears_up_for_q3_deliveries_while_musk_buys/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.153393

They’re basically getting written into the smart mobility strategy there, and the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah himself was literally the first passenger on their Robobus.

The pilot’s starting on Al Marjan Island, tourist hub that’s also gonna host the Middle East’s first casino, but the Robotaxis will also be operating in the city center. 

Couple of things that stood out to me:

They signed an MoU with RAKTA to basically be the sole partner for AV solutions there.

They’re positioning themselves as part of the regulatory and operational framework in UAE mobility.

They’re already in Singapore, Dubai, France, Belgium, Saudi, China, and the US

Both BOCI and Citi slapped Buy ratings on them recently. BOCI set a $20 target.

He claims: “I haven't sold any of my CEO stock and intend never to in the future”. I decided to get through all the SEC Form 4 records and put them in a table so we all can make a judgment.

Here are all Niccolo de Masi's transactions:

|2025-09-11|Sale|\-16,120|$47.05|$758,446.00|1,181,186|

Here is how I interpret the situation.

IONQ company:

* Current market cap: 20 billion 
* Has negative net income: -331m in 2024, -176m in Q2 2025
* Miserable gross revenue: 43m in 2024, 20m in Q2 2025
* The dilution is going crazy: Q1 2025 - 25m shares printed. Q2 2025 - 49m (almost $3billion from market cap in one quater) 

What I see in CEO actions:

* Appointed as CEO in 2025
* In Q1-Q2 of 2025 was awarded almost the same amount of $$$ in shares as the whole gross revenue of IONQ in 2024
* The dude goes public and says: “We are the next Nvidia”, “We will make billions in the future”.  
* Stock makes an insane 600%
* The new CEO sells most of his holdings from before 2025, yet in 2025, he gets a massive amount of new shares

What I think:

It is true, he did not sell any of his CEO stock. In fact, in 2025, while being CEO, he got more than a million new shares. I guess that he will get even more in 2025-2026. In this way, his number of shares and stake would remain the same as before 2025, but he managed to print more than 100 million $ in cash on quantum hype. 

This is more than the projected revenue of IONQ for 2025, which is between $82 million and $100 million (and remember, net is still negative) 

Quite a good deal.

1nvw7lt,stocks,How do you see the whole AI bubble playing out?,"OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. are entrenched in Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle, Dell, whatever. They are significantly driving up the cloud revenue of these companies, which in turn buy from Nvidia. Investors keep pouring billions into the AI companies, which keep engaging in price wars with each other and spend whatever little they have left on R&D and paying absurdly high salaries in the name of superintelligence.

When, not if,  this bubble bursts and investor funding dries up for the unprofitable companies, what the hell happens? Call me naive but I just don't see a world where chatgpt doesn't exist anymore or one where people use less AI in the future. Even though the LLM companies are not ideal investments, their products are ridiculously good and it is no secret that all the corporations in the world, say in 10 years, will have significantly higher automation than it does today.

My guess is that these big ones (example OpenAI) are almost too big to fail. If there are concerns about liquidity Sundar or Satya or Zuck would probably swoop in to strike a deal with them. Given this assessment and the idea that the world tomorrow would use more AI than it does today, probably a good idea to invest in something like Dell I think, which is currently at a P/OCF of 13 and pouring large amounts into making data centers. In the alternative that some of these big ones fail, I still think there would be someone else to fill the gap and data center companies would stay afloat.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band.

1nvo22s,stocks,IBM : the Nvidia of Quantum computing ?,"Hi everyone,

For a while now, I've been seeing a lot of people betting on quantum computers. I've noticed small companies whose stocks have gone up 10x in just a few months. Some are hoping to find the next gem that will lead this new world, which could be the next technological revolution.

Personally, I don't really understand this sector. I've been hearing about quantum computers for years, but it's true that the Nvidia wave, a simple graphics card company that became the world's largest market capitalization, to the point where a few thousand euros invested seven years ago would make you a millionaire today, has made people eager to bet on the next revolution.

I've done my own research on quantum computing, and when I listen to experts, it feels like it's still very far off, even though there's some ""experimental"" commercialization starting. These computers still make too many errors and don't meet the expected needs.

But in my research, one company keeps coming up when it comes to significant advancements in the sector: IBM. Yet, when I look at IBM's stock price, it's nowhere near the small-cap companies that have seen their stocks multiply by 10.

Today, I'm wondering if IBM, with its experience, technological advancements, and especially its financial resources, isn't the best-positioned company in this space.

However, I never see IBM mentioned in this sector. Worse, IBM is even excluded from sector-specific ETFs.

1nvg1dy,stocks,"Reminder - Tesla sales trending down, maybe unprofitable 3Q from no emissions credits, and taxi still has safety drivers - stock UP 30% Lol","The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds. 

* Publicly available China sales data- which is about 35% of Tesla's sales - is still down 9% year over year, and Europe sales are still falling. American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits, but with Elon's alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales, and significantly increased EV competition in the US, that bump is likely to be marginable at best. Accordingly, Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter, stagnant at best. Remember, in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year (traditional EV sales, not robotaxi sales) by 2030. They've been stagnant - now decreasing - at under 2 million car sales for over a year now. 



* Worse still, the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter, as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration. Notably, those emissions credits have accounted for, on average, 50% of Tesla's net income over the past 5 quarters; and, 1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of -$186 million without the $595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter. 



* And, while robotaxi is interesting and technologically, looks like it's trending towards feasibly working, Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in -which is mainly Austin at the moment - despite Musk saying it would reach half the U.S. population by the end of the year.  And, recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road, a ratio of 0.3/car/month. Waymo, in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1,500 cars on the road across the country, a ratio 0.03/car/month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla. And, while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now, not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and, at this point, had demonstrated to be a working technology; but more and more competitors are popping up, such as Zoox in the U.S.; and pony.ai, BYD, and Baidu in Asia. Which is to say, competition is coming, and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla, for the robotaxi space as well. 



* Additionally, if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride-share market - as that's likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car - even assuming mature, robust market share and profit margins, the valuation is still probably under $300 range. For example, by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024. If you assume Tesla had 50% of that market (which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions - Apple, for example, has a 25% global market share); and, assuming that, pursuant to Musk's own projections, the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to $0.30/mile, and they charged a reasonable $1/mile to riders, and that does not go lower with more competition; that would give 100 billion miles \* 0.5 market share \* $0.70 profit per mile = $35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year. $35 billion/3.4 billion shares = $10.29 per share and giving that a P/E of 30 gives you $308 target price. In other words, in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi's had global reach and 50% market share, and profit margins of 70% per mile, the high price is still only $300 a share. 

**Tesla is up 30% this month to $450 a share as of today**, and likely trending towards a P/E of over 300 as it's EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of $1 to $2. **Gotta love the American stock market!**",384,289,2025-10-01 18:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nvg1dy/reminder_tesla_sales_trending_down_maybe/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.153669

1nvetjt,stocks,Unpopular opinion(s) what RDDT needs to do to survive,"I've said it before, and and I'll say it again. RDDT won't scale unless spez makes controversial moves and tough decisions. I'm going to compare them to Meta, as many have said Reddit is a ""baby Meta"". 

1.) They need to buy a company like Discord like how FB bought instagram. 

2.) They need to FLOOD the feed with ads, like how Instagram does currently.

3.) They need to sell user data and pander more to right wing. Left wing users are mostly tapped out and have less to spend. Use the Elon Musk playbook. Tesla at all time highs even with left wing boycotts lol. Look at Bluesky, running out of funding while Truth Social somehow still strong as ever. I'm not sure how Reddit manages this, but probably involves removing some left wing moderators and adding more right leaning ones.

On the above point, my biggest worry right now and risk to reddit is Trump using the Reddit is a left-wing antifa terrorist organization rhetoric. Maybe even going as far as getting the FCC to shut it down. Steve Huffman really needs to kiss the ring.

1nvbe1f,stocks,Amazon launches ‘price-conscious’ grocery brand with most products under $5,"Amazon on Wednesday expanded its private-label grocery lineup with the launch of a new brand aimed at “price-conscious” shoppers, with most products priced under $5.

The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. Amazon said the new offering unites its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands under one label.

“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” Jason Buechel, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement.

It’s not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was “focused on value.”

The move comes as Amazon’s grocery business has been in flux.

The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of “everyday essentials” within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

The company last month expanded same-day delivery of fresh foods to more pockets of the U.S. as it looks to encourage shoppers to add meat and eggs to their order while they’re browsing its sprawling online store.

1nv985m,stocks,Cidara ($CDTX): Why 75% Probability of Success for Cidara’s Universal Flu Prophylaxis CD388 Is a Conservative Anchor for Valuation,"**TL;DR:** Many Phase 3 programs are treated like a 50/50 coin toss by investors in terms of probability of success. Here’s why I think CD388 is closer to 75%.

**Disclosure:** I hold shares of $CDTX. This is not investment advice.

In my original valuation post [CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)  I modeled CD388 using a **75% probability of success (PoS)**. Some readers pushed back, saying Phase 3 programs are “coin flips” until final results are out.   That’s often true, but I think CD388, Cidara’s long-acting influenza prophylaxis, is further along than that. This post explains why I believe **75% is a realistic and conservative anchor** for estimating what the company should be worth today:

**1)   The dataset is unusually large and robust**  
Many Phase 2 programs enroll a few hundred patients. CD388’s phase 2b NAVIGATE trial had **over 5,000 participants** and took place across multiple geographies during an exceptionally strong flu season.  At the 450 mg dose, efficacy hit **76% vs placebo (95% CI: 49–90%, p<0.0001)**. That kind of result gives far more confidence than you’d get from smaller, underpowered studies that often precede a Phase 3.

**2)   The mechanism isn’t a leap of faith**  
Plenty of Phase 3 failures come from untested biology. CD388 leverages **zanamivir**, the active in Relenza, which already has 20+ years of human safety/efficacy data. The Fc extension used in CD388 changes the half-life, not the core antiviral mechanism, and Fc fragments have been widely used in other approved biologics without introducing new safety liabilities.

**3)   Safety looks clean so far**  
In NAVIGATE, no dose-dependent safety issues appeared across 150, 300, or 450 mg. Adverse events tracked with placebo.

**4)   FDA has signaled confidence**  
The FDA just recently accepted Phase 2b as **pivotal** and allowed a single Phase 3 to serve for BLA filing (see   [$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npc6fd/cdtx_fda_minutes_confirm_expanded_accelerated/)). CD388 already has **Fast Track**, and the company has also applied for **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)**. If granted, BTD would be a further strong validation, speeding review and signaling FDA’s view that CD388 meets a serious unmet need.

**5)   A exceptionally strong flu season stress-tested the drug**  
The 2024–25 flu season was severe, creating abundant endpoints and ensuring the trial was well-powered (better than expected). That adds confidence that efficacy wasn’t a fluke of low case counts.

**While the strong data and FDA support make it tempting to push the probability of success up a notch, I am anchoring it to 75% to stay \*conservative\*.**   The point isn’t that risk has vanished because clearly it hasn’t.  It’s that CD388’s Phase 3 isn’t the typical binary gamble retail investors assume for an asset at this stage of development.  Assuming 75% probability of success in my valuation model reflects the strength of the data and FDA’s stance without overstating the case.

**TL;DR (again):** Many Phase 3s are a coin toss in terms of probability of success. CD388 has strong data, a validated anti-viral mechanism, Fc fragment safety precedent, clean safety over a large phase 2b trial, and FDA confidence,  which is why I am sticking to a 75% probability of success in my valuation model.

I’ll be following up with a separate post to update my **valuation analysis** now that FDA minutes have confirmed the Phase 3 plan and expanded TAM to include all adults over 65.",7,6,2025-10-01 14:09:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nv985m/cidara_cdtx_why_75_probability_of_success_for/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.153818

> AI is changing fast, and so are its information sources. ChatGPT may be pulling back from Reddit, once a goldmine for conversational training data. If true, this marks a turning point where verified information beats crowdsourced content. A recent observation from Andrea Bosoni caught attention: ChatGPT seems to be ditching Reddit answers. OpenAI apparently figured out that random forum posts aren't always trustworthy. The days of spamming Reddit with fake brand mentions to manipulate AI responses? Pretty much over.

> Reddit was valuable for years because of its massive range of discussions and natural conversational style that helped train AI dialogue. But it came with baggage - misinformation, low-quality threads, and people actively trying to game the system. This move signals something bigger across the AI industry: the push for trusted, verifiable data sources. Better accuracy, less misinformation, and harder to manipulate - that's the goal.

>The tradeoff is real. You'll probably get more consistent, fact-based answers. But that quirky, community-driven personality Reddit brought to responses? That might be fading. For the AI world, it's a clear message: transparency and trust in training data aren't optional anymore. ChatGPT's Reddit pullback shows where AI is headed - credibility over chaos. Fewer wild responses, more reliability.

Companies shed a seasonally adjusted 32,000 jobs during the month, the biggest slide since March 2023, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 45,000.

In addition to the drop in September, the August payrolls number was revised to a loss of 3,000 from an initially reported increase of 54,000.

The other services category posted a drop of 16,000, while professional and business services was off 13,000, trade, transportation and utilities declined by 7,000 and construction lost 5,000.

1nuzqe0,stocks,PATH to Orchestration,"This morning, ahead of their Fusion conference in Las Vegas, UiPath released some massive press releases. The common theme across all of them - UiPath is partnering with the biggest tech companies to ensure that UiPath's workflow orchestration system, called Maestro, is at the top of its game and able to connect with the best agents and data tools.

They announced partnerships with Snowflake so that Snowflake's Cortex AI agent can integrate into Maestro. This is crucial as many of UiPath's customers have their data stored in Snowflake and will be leveraging their agents for data insights. They also announced huge partnerships with Google Gemini, OpenAI, and NVIDIA. I encourage you to read the press releases for yourself. 

Why is this so important? UiPath is not trying to create every AI agent from scratch - instead, they are building the platform that orchestrates all of the agents and robots at the top...like a Maestro does with a full string orchestra. This will allow UiPath to stay extremely nimble and allow their customers to have access to the best agents in the world - some of which will be built by other companies (CortexAI, NVIDIA) and others that will be in-house (UiPath's PeakAI).

I'm not suprised by these announcements - in my prior post with some detailed DD on PATH, I mentioned that they were already partnered with LangChain and Microsoft Copilot to break down any concerns of developing walled gardens. It's still early days in UiPath's second act; however, the path there is clear. If you are a believer that corporations will be building agentic automation into their workforce at scale, then you are bullish PATH. The company is carving out its spot as the agnostic platform (a.k.a. the Switzerland of automation) that will span across their customers' entire enterprises.",2,0,2025-10-01 05:18:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuzqe0/path_to_orchestration/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.153934

1nuunc4,stocks,I am still bullish on CAVA,"I come in here to write up on a nice little stock I like to call CAVA. I just demoralized one of their Mediterranean bowls the other day, and when I was inside, some girl said, ""Why can't they open one up in Parksville?"" I almost said, don't worry shawty, eventually they will.

CAVA has just reached its 52-week low and touched 25 on the RSI yesterday. Its 52-week spread is honestly incredible, 172 high, 58 low, and I feel for those who bought in the triple digits. But I'm not done believing. And I'm CERTAINLY not fading them because of a 50x multiple. Can you guess Chipotle's multiple over the last decade? It is 77x. Over the last seven years, Chipotle grew EPS roughly 40% CAGR (excluding COVID). Chipper was really always trading at a premium.

Now, I'm not sitting here comparing them to Chipotle, just looking at an industry peer. But I want to put into perspective just how small CAVA is, and just how enticing this 2032 1,000-restaurant goal is. They currently only have 400 locations across the U.S. In 2007, one year after Chipper's IPO, they had \~700. Five years later, they doubled their store count, and in those five years, more than doubled their operating margin. In fact, Chipper's operating margin in 2007 was 7.5%, similar to CAVA's 7.38% last quarter. Rapid expansion in the QSR industry pushes margins, and like Ackman said, you can't go wrong owning a growing food chain.

I'm still bullish on CAVA, and yes, I own the shit out of it. I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts. Just wanted to provide a little historical context with Chipper, as they are widely considered the next Chipper in Mediterranean.",34,77,2025-10-01 01:00:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuunc4/i_am_still_bullish_on_cava/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.153981

1nushl2,stocks,How to manage a good quality startup stock?,"*EDIT: Clearly the word startup is causing confusion :) By startup, I am referring to a company that is in early stages, yet to prove / have a stable 'product' (but has proven its steps to get there), is growing fast, learning fast. This company is pre-revenue, publicly traded.*

I'll leave out the stock name to avoid clouding judgement and personal preferences over industry, company, etc. Keen to get your general thoughts on this stock managing question.

Essentially, there is a technology company (with hardware+software products) that's another couple of years away from properly generating revenue. It is a leader in its space, very innovative, very well-connected with traditional industry leaders, has great leadership with great technical background. They play it safe, do not boast. All in all, I feel quite confident in their direction and ability to navigate issues as they hit them. But - They've only hit limited milestones yet (limited compared to final target, but well on-schedule and not technologically limited by any stretch of imagination) and may hit various issues like any startup. Of course, they have good competitors too, though it is not crowded at the moment.

The stock tends to go up and down quite a bit, but I feel there is decent investor confidence.

The big questions are:

\- How much % of your portfolio would you invest in such a stock?  
\- Would you hold it forever? (or at least till it starts generating revenue and profits)  
\- Or would you try to do a bit of swing trading to time the up-downs? This could be even on a part of your holding, but of course there is no guarantee you will time it properly and very like you will get it wrong! But equally, it feels a shame to be holding on to say, 9-10% gain YTD when the stock's gone up and down 30-40%. Of course, like any good startup, as it starts generating revenue and stabilizes as a company, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3x or more jump in share price...",0,31,2025-09-30 23:20:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nushl2/how_to_manage_a_good_quality_startup_stock/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.154012

1nuop9u,stocks,Nvidia Stock Manipulation,"Edit: if you ever wanted to know when to buy a stock or sell, just look to see if the comments are greedy or fearful.
Sentiment changes fast from my post not too long ago where I was also mocked for saying 230 in an AI bubble is unrealistic 

Recently I made a bold post,I claimed Nvidia would hit 230 by year end….

It’s possible but after today I’m disgusted by the price manipulation.

112,000,000 combined volume before a random thrust up? 

112,000,000/171,000,000 came from two huge bursts of volume. 

This changed my outlook and perception on Nvidia to the downside. If the company is mismanaging and manipulating the stock price to this degree I can’t say I want any part of this.

I looked into the so deal… OpenAI only generates 12B in revenue yet received 100billion? This just seems insane considering OpenAI burned 8billion this year and they’re not profitable but competing against google,tesla,meta that are very profitable especially in free cash flow. At least pets.com didn’t lose insane amounts of money each year.

So Nvidia, why did you invest 100billion in them? Where did these 112,000,000 volumes come from. Now that some random company with 224billion suddenly bought….super interesting 

I’m out of this stock, it’s too risky if it
‘s the case they need outside deals from ‘investors’ to keep a stock moving the way they’d like it to move 

Nvidia is the Enron of today and if you know that history it’s not good.

There is already a huge rise in unemployment of college grads compared to past 30 years trend.

I see everyone saying that AI may be a bubble or not a bubble but nobody is talking about what if populist politicians all over the world get in the way and make laws to limit the use of AI when they are reducing headcount.

Having said that, I am scratching my head on how can they even make a law restricting the running of a private company, seems like impossible to do it, isn't it?

Only thing that comes to my mind is: They can make a law to raise taxes on companies if they have increasing profit but reducing headcount. Sounds like a very bad idea since it goes against the very fabric of increasing output via efficiency.

On second thought I think this risk is very low since AI companies will also lobby against it, not to mention it is anti free market capitalism and reeks of a command economy like some communist countries.

1nuhymn,stocks,Pfizer Gets Three-Year Grace Period From Trump Pharma Tariffs,"Bloomberg) -- Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said the company secured a three-year grace period from President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals in a deal that would lower some of its US drug prices.

The company will sell some products at a 50% average discount on a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx, an initiative intended to allow Americans to pay cash for drugs at discounted rates negotiated by the government.

The deal appears to resolve two major threats facing Pfizer, as it would stave off more damaging drug pricing policies while shielding the company from future tariffs imposed by the administration’s Section 232 investigation into whether the cost of medicine represents a national security threat. 

It’s the latest example of the transactional nature of winning tariff exemptions from Trump, who has unilaterally wielded trade policy to exert power over multiple industries. As recently as last week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on the industry. 

As part of its deal, Pfizer will offer across-the-board reductions on US prices for Americans enrolled in the Medicaid insurance program, giving them “most favored nation” pricing on some of its medicines, Trump said. He has repeatedly pressured companies to bring their US prices in line with what foreign countries pay for medicines.

“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said.

Bourla also announced a $70 billion push on research and development and domestic manufacturing over the next few years. The company was one of the rare exceptions among major drugmakers who rushed to highlight the return of manufacturing facilities to the US amid pressure from Trump.

“We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing, that have suppressed the industry’s valuations to historic lows,” Bourla said in a statement.",424,144,2025-09-30 16:32:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nuhymn/pfizer_gets_threeyear_grace_period_from_trump/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.154198

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1ntsp96,stocks,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",258,130,2025-09-29 20:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.154358

In both sides, Commodities will surge, and debt becomes less of an issue. Right now, KOS has a lot of debt, but a weakening currency works in its favor. If A.I. and AGI actually come through, energy will become the new gold like more than actual gold. And yes, eventually renewables like solar will take over, but if you look at what these data centers are and will run on, it’s mostly traditional power.

1ntm28y,stocks,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings & Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi & AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",14,2,2025-09-29 16:05:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,2025-10-03 09:03:38.154513
1ntjtyt,stocks,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,2025-09-29 14:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.647346

1ntg57l,stocks,Auto Parts Manufacturer Bankruptcy:  Impact on the parts retailers?,"First Brands filed for bankruptcy this morning and has major customer concentration in retailers like Autozone, O'Reilly, NAPA and similar.  The company would continue supplying parts, but what happens in the medium to long term with retailers when a major supplier falls down?   I assume that costs can go up as they seek wider sources of supply for their privately branded parts.   Any hiccup in metrics for these high valuation companies could at least be a set-back to their stock prices.

O'Reilly, for example trades at a steep PE multiple (38x last year's earnings) and achieved a $90 billion market cap last week (more than Target and Best Buy combined, and much more than either Ford or GM).   

Over time, these retailers have been borrowing ever larger amounts of money to buy back their shares, boosting their earnings per share figures.   Yet, their operating income (up 18%) is only growing at the rate of CPI inflation (15% since 2021), despite adding many new store outlets.   On average, O'Reilly has grown operating income per store only about 3% over four years which is way below inflation.  

I am betting those PE multiples will come down.   Even going from 38 down to 30 would be near-term hit to stock price.",12,9,2025-09-29 12:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntg57l/auto_parts_manufacturer_bankruptcy_impact_on_the/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.647416

1nt6p0a,stocks,I am shorting UNH - Very High Quality Analysis,"I wrote everything myself and did not use AI. Images are not allowed here so please refer to the same post on other subs for attached screenshots of my analysis.

Alright guys, this is me going against the entire reddit world as you’ve probably seen everyone on reddit going long on UNH (including myself earlier this year where I made some really good profits on both stocks and options). I closed all my UNH positions this week.

 

And before I get into my short thesis, I’d like to get into why I bought this company in the first place. Because I am not shorting this stock because it is a bad company (To the contrary, UNH actually has a very smart business model and is a big moat business). **I am shorting because** I believe the market isn’t seeing several structural risks that could break the fundamentals in 2026.

 

**Why I went long earlier this year**:

I’ll admit, I didn’t really do a “proper” DD on this stock when I bought. I listened to the “Business Breakdown” podcast on Spotify where a UK fund manager explained why UNH is more than just a managed care company.

A few points she said that made me buy:

\- It’s a health data company with all the information in the world – kinda like the Google of healthcare (huge moat for UNH in terms of pricing & cost savings)

\- Health insurance isn’t long term (such as life insurance), so they can re-price their books in \~1+ years if they made a mistake (they have room to make mistake & fix quickly)

\- Health insurance can only earn up to \~15% from government rules (operating margin goes much lower than that as the 15% is the most), but Optum health expands their margin from Value based care: doctors get paid a fee to keep patients healthy, if patient cost is less than fees, they keep all the remaining as profit.

Value based care offers high quality service and can help patients prevent being hospitalized. This reduces insurance cost (patients who get hospitalized tend to cost significantly more vs preventative care)

\- The vertical integration between health care financer and healthcare provider is a gigantic moat & this idea just sounded smart af.

This sounded very much like a buffet-style business at the time, so I just had to look at valuations.

At the time, I did a quick valuation using the 5-year historic Operating Cashflow & CapEx growth rates to project a 5-year DCF. I did a bear, base, bull case FCF exit multiples of 10x, 15x, 20x (pretty modest). With a WACC of 7.35%, my target prices were $236 (bear), $337 (base), and $438 (bull).

 

 

**Bear thesis**:

If you looked at my valuation DCF above, you’d know that I made a good profit on UNH. The UNH market price has even climbed higher than my base-case target price of $337.

But here is the issue with my DCF, I assumed everything will carry on as it did in the past and the company will continue to grow in the same rate of growth. I also assumed the market will not further compress the multiples which are key to the valuation. And that is the core of my bear thesis:

***UNH has fundamental cracks on Optum, and they will have a very difficult time in 2026 + I think UNH is & has tried to hide it.***

The very fact that the market is going towards my earlier DCF makes me believe the market isn’t pricing in this risk. In fact, the market expanded UNH’s multiple from the Berkshire news (which I will get into later).

 

**What makes the stock price go up?**

From my bull thesis above, you could probably figure out Optum health is where the money is at – and this is what moves the needle (what ultimately makes the stock go up).

But how does this reflect on fundamentals? Let me briefly summarize what UNH is:

**UnitedHealth - What is it - It’s a 2-part business (numbers mostly from 2024 10k, screenshot of my excel attached below)**

 

**1. United Healthcare (\~40% of Revenue) – Insurance provider**

**- Employer & Individual (\~25% of healthcare revenue):** For corporations who pays for health insurance. The employer either pay a monthly premium (UNH takes the risk of claims cost) or employers pays a fixed fee for UNH to administer the health service search (UNH bears no risk).

**- Medicare & Retirement (\~50% of healthcare revenue):** For old people above age 65. Government pays a fixed fee per patient every month.

**- Community & State (\~24% of healthcare revenue):** For Medicaid, aka poor people, the state/community pays a fixed fee per month.

 

**2. Optum (\~60% of Revenue) – Healthcare provider**

**- Optum Health (\~40% of revenue):** Provides the patient care & financial services.

**- Optum Insight (\~10% of revenue):** The data & analytics business.

**-  Optum RX (\~50% of revenue):** Pharmacy care services.

(These numbers are from 10k from 2024 and 2021)

 

In short: The 2 biggest parts of UNH’s revenue are Medicare Advantage and Optum Health.

Medicare certainly moves the needle as it’s a big reason why the stock sold off this year. This is due to elevated medical claim amount /or increasing medical loss ratio for UNH - basically, old people are catching up on their knee-replacement surgeries after the COVID lockdown + playing too much pickle ball.

But for UNH, Optum Health plays an even larger role (also Medicare is the largest component of Optum Health so they add up). Not just because it brings in the most amount of revenue, but because it’s the actual growth engine for the company. If you look at UNH a decade ago, United Health (the insurance wing) was 90% of the business and Optum was only 10%. Now the roles have reversed, UNH is more Optum than insurance. As we’ve mentioned earlier, Optum helps UNH expand their margins through value-based care.

**Look at the period from 2020 – 2024**:

Optum revenue annual growth: \~13.16% vs \~8% for healthcare (it’s really \~4% if you net out eliminations)

Optum Operating Margin: \~8% vs \~5.5% for healthcare

Optum Operating income growth: \~11%+ vs \~4.75% for healthcare (yeah it grows more than double the rate of healthcare)

UNH Stock price: More than doubled in the same period. (if you count trough to peak prices: $230.1 to $630.73 that’s a 174% gain)

This isn’t the kind of stock price growth you would expect from a mature stage health insurance company growing in the single digits. This is your typical growth company with a growing topline + margin expansion (aka Optum)

 

**What did the market price in already?**

Yes. the stock price had dropped from the peak of around $600 to the mid $200s and has since rebounded to the mid $300s. It is still “cheap” when compared to previous highs. It is obvious that the market has absorbed some bad outlooks for the company. But is it really cheap?

I’ve listed out a few main things the market has priced in (up until the most recent Q2):

Optum long-term margin:

\- Earnings were $6.6 billon below management expectation in q2

\- Operating margin for the full year is guided to be 1%.

\- Management further revised down the long-term margin outlook for Optum to be 6% - 8% (from 8 - 10%).

Medical cost surge:

\- Total unexpected medical cost impact of $6.5 billion (this is a short-tail risk as they can reprice this next year)

\- Medicare advantage cost trend is more than expected (utilization of 7.5% vs 5% previously): I mean, this doesn’t add up here. Management’s Q2 earnings call said they’ve been cutting back on benefits, but they still see a growth in utilization? I think UNH has been easing claims approval due to societal pressure. (maybe this part hasn’t been priced in yet as the Medicare cost headwind will be a persistent issue from here).

\- Behavioural health in Medicaid: 20% cost growth (margins are f\*cked here as margin compression is baked into guidance in q2)

Change Healthcare

\- They suffered from a cyber-attack in early 2024 and Optum Insight is still trying to recover from this.

V28 risk model adjustment

\- I will get into the details of V28 below: Currently management said there will be $11 billion headwind over 3 years, and we have $4 billion more to go for 2026.

\- Management said they will get rid of unprofitable clients + increase price + cut cost to offset half of the $4 billion headwind in 2026. (I doubt this and will get into it below)

 

Smart Money (Berkshire Hathaway)

\-  Its kinda hard not to hit the buy button when you see the GOAT of value investing put his own money in this company.

\- My only commentary for this is: 1) Berkshire didn’t put a lot of money in it. 2) they bought before q2 earnings came out (as we are seeing more structural breakdown in q2).

 

**So, what isn’t priced in?**

**1. V28 risk model Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) Risk Adjustment Model (there is more to it…)**

Basically, this risk model is how Optum’s value-based care business gets paid.

For example, a normal patient is $1000 a month. But if this patient has a heart condition, then this HCC risk model gives him a coefficient of maybe 1.5. All of a sudden, this patient will get 1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 a month.

Before V28, UNH has been able to kind of skirt this system by aggressively diagnosing and applying elevated coefficients to get paid more.

For evidence, let’s look at DaVita Medical Group, which UnitedHealth’s Optum acquired in 2019. On a 5-year trend analysis, the risk coding jumped from 1.01x pre-acquisition to 1.5x post-acquisition. If this isn’t aggressive, I don’t know what is!

So, what did V28 do? In plain English, it’s stricter and UNH can no longer code aggressively (they got rid of 2000 diagnostic categories and flattened the weighting for some conditions – less room for a doctor to say: this guy has diabetes, and I think it’s severe, let’s give him a 2.0 instead of 1.5).

On top of that, UNH employs 10% of doctors in the U.S and with the pricing pressure + more utilization rate (aka. Old people visiting more often), I just don’t buy what management was saying (they can offset 50% of the V28 headwind next year by ‘cost savings’). I think Optum margins will be negative in 2026 and be lower than 5 - 7% long-term. And this is the structural risk to the fundamentals.

 

**2. Shady Accounting Treatment**

**a. Selling a part of their Optum business and using gains as operating income**

Considering UNH’s entire $5 billion of Optum’s operating earnings growth for 2024 came from this ‘gain on sales,’ this certainly isn’t a good look for UNH. And guess what, they have been doing this in both 2024 and 2025.

It also makes me wonder why? My thesis is that if you look at the V28 risk model revision headwind total of $11 billion over 3 years, it’s around $3 billion a year. So maybe they are using this as offset for this headwind. But regardless, they have been shady with accounting, and I think there is more to this.

*(From the 2024 10k – MD&A section*)

To add, they’ve decided to stop this in q2 this year, resulting in a $2 billion loss for Optum earnings. This means 2 things: 1) they’ve been doing this for over a year and a half; 2) They were gonna fill $2 billion of financials holes doing the same thing but just decided to stop.

(from the 2025 q2 earnings call transcript)

 

**b. Use intercompany transactions to inflate segment profitability**

While this isn’t 100% confirmed, certain industry contacts have indicated that Optum is selling services to the United Healthcare side for much more than the market price. They do this to inflate the profitability of Optum (this information is taken from Baird analyst Michael Ha’s interview video with Steve Eisman).

From a simple google search, I can also find similar headlines where UNH is upselling internally.

From reading the 2024 10k myself, I am also a bit confused at the “elimination” line in the income statement from MD&A (it’s basically the transaction between Optum and Healthcare, but since there is another line called “Optum Elimination,” this line is for the Healthcare segment). They only net out this amount in the consolidated revenue amount. However, if we take a look at the UnitedHealthcare revenue by business on page 29, they did not net out the ‘eliminations’ at all. This makes the story much more believable.

 

(from 2024 10k, yeah, they didn’t net out eliminations)

 

**Valuation + Price Target**

My new assumptions (that isn’t even too pessimistic):

Operating cashflow stays flat for 2025 & 2026 and resumes a 1% growth from 2027 to 2029.

CapEx grows at the same 5-year CAGR historical rate (assuming they need to maintain their business).

And the reason why my assumptions aren’t too pessimistic is because my 2025 FCF is $20 billion (much higher than management’s Q2 guidance of $16 billion). They also didn’t mention any plans regarding CapEx but I am being more than generous to maintain historical growth rate as they definitely will need more CapEx to maintain (given their elevated utilization rate – rumor has it that UNH has been easing the claims approval process due to public pressure. Otherwise, this story won’t add up cuz their benefits are less rich compared to national average).

 

(source: my shitty excel sheet)

**Target price**: I think we can at least see the low $200s (maybe even lower) if my thesis plays out. But I’ll start to take profit once we get below $ 250 by selling some poor-man-covered-puts. I will get into details on my executions below.

 

**Shorting Strategy, Position, and Execution Plans:**

**Strategy**: Synthetic Short (kinda) with a long call to cap my loss:

 Sell 300/350 Dec 2027 Credit Call Spread + Buy 300 Jan 2028 LEAPS Put

**Position**:

 

Premium from Call Spread: $9,794.8 - $7,461.25 = $2,333.55

Debit for LEAPS Put: ($4,105.2)

Net Debit: ($1,771.65)

Max Loss Possible: $5,000 + $4,105.2 - $2,333.55 = $6,771.65

 

**Execution Plan**:

**Take profit**: If we drop below \~$250, I will start selling 30 DTE puts and close my call spread position to de-risk. I will fully exit my positions once we drop below $200 or my thesis has played out where Optum blows up.

**Stop loss**: I will hold till early 2027 and see if my thesis has played about/hasn’t played out/has yet to play out. I will hold up to the 45 DTE point and exit regardless.

 

**Conclusion**: I think this company is a short because the story isn’t over yet. Not because UNH a bad company, but because the structural cracks (Optum: V28 + Shady Accounting + Optum margin reset) aren’t fully priced in yet and people are already celebrating on the Berkshire bandwagon.",0,34,2025-09-29 02:32:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nt6p0a/i_am_shorting_unh_very_high_quality_analysis/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.647635

My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,2025-09-28 13:17:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.647761

Trump has championed fossil fuels while attacking the renewable energy industry since taking office in January. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, delivered virtually everything the oil lobby wanted.

But Trump's push for lower crude prices, higher tariffs, and the resulting uncertainty caused by his ""stroke of pen"" policies are hurting investment, executives at independent oil and gas producers told the Dallas Fed.

Nearly 80% of executives who participated in the survey said they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the future price of oil and the cost of producing crude.

""We have begun the twilight of shale,"" one executive said, pointing to layoffs by the thousands and industry consolidation under big companies like Exxon Mobil.

1ns965v,stocks,"I would like to invest in Gold, Cooper and maybe Oil.","Hi everyone,

I'm french and watched some economic/financial tv shows. They are talking more and mora about metals and oil.

Yesterday, a financial analyst says 6 millions ton of cooper will miss in the next years. The main reason is typically the industrial sector need more and more, and the reserve are emptier and emptier. So maybe I wonder it's the best time to invest in a good mine company to enjoy the futur strong demand.

About gold, they expected the price will keep on rising strongly because the weakess of dollars and the currency policy of asian country (like the new habits of people) will push the demand. I've just sold Genesis Minerals, that looks a beautiful gold mines, but I needed some cash for another investment. Today, it's tricky to find a good point because too much vol.

Oil : It's tricky. One of them said it's a big time to invest in oil. The reserves look weak, and big oil companies tries to find more and more new reserve. But, the main of analyst said it's not a good move because today, every actor (included investment sector) bet on green energy and are not convinced oil will get a good bet on the next 5 years.

So i would like to get your opinion and if you got some stock to advise, you're welcome :)

1nrqj71,stocks,"Railroads magnates, what do you think of the 85bln $ merger between UNP and NSC merger?","TLDR: Railroad haven’t performed very well in the past years but may still be a solid investment. Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

1nrc9au,stocks,Ramaco Resources METC and METCB,"Ramaco Resources is a metalurgical coal mining company that is developing rare earth minerals which have been found in softer clay strata located above and below the seams. Excitement over their rare earth potential is driving high interest in their stock, but mainly class A, $METC. Recent analyst forecasts for METC are $42 and $45. So, there's good potential for return beyond the current price of $31.

But here's the intriguing thing, class B stock is the tracking stock for the rare earth minerals. It will get 20% of the income generated by the rare earths, plus a coal fee per ton and royalty fees. There is currently 
10.84 million shares B extent and 55.18 million shares class A, putting class B at 16.4% of the total. So it certainly seems the better of the two, but class B ($METCB). is currently trading at a 50% discount to class B. 

I own some class B shares and so far, every time I compare dividends with class A, it's been better. Class B should never be worth more than A because the company has the right to convert them back to class A. But class B has the same asset claims as class A. 

This continues to amaze me and I keep coming back to see if there's anything I'm missing, so would really appreciate any insights you might have.

* In the past 3 months I am seeing more insider buys than sales
* Stable demand signals

1nr23ui,stocks,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.**

It’s a short term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you.  
Trading influencers will also love it.  
I’m not being cynical, I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call.

Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post adresses key nuances in the arguement for and against PDT’s removal.

# Here’s my main point:

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media influenced.

**The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.**

# Addressing Surface-Level Nuances

A trader had said,  
“People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.”

This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market.  
Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule).

This trader had also said,  
“There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.”

For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.**

# Nuance 1: The Main Narrative 

“What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.”

I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics.

# Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market.

Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco.

It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation.

**Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.**

The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.

# Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade?

That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money.

I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience.

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced.

# Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000

If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in.

**Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks**

The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders

It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions.

**Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule**

Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way.

It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk.

The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms.

In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional.

People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone.

**Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.**

I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new.

# Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now!

This isn’t true and it’s a short term anecdotes don’t hold weight and trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that over the strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176)

# Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it

This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor.

Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account.

# Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning.

Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors.

**Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.**  
That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit

**Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.**

Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations.

# Ending / Agenda

For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate.

**If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?**  
I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs.

I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest.  
**Lobbyists make the call.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

My understanding is that Hedged indexes protects from currency fluctuations in my case EUR-USD, but with some extra TER cost, in this example 0.03%

Am i wrong in thinking that the extra 0.03% (i know it is compounded over time) is worth the spent to protect from the currency fluctuations? I am not experienced enough to understand Forex and this is why I prefer to play it a little safer. Am I wrong in thinking that?

Also, the NQSE is 10x smaller (hedged - i know it is newer as well), is that because people prefer to get a riskier ETF (SXRV unhedged) that will generate more profit if the EUR will get weaker than USD?

Is the unhedged like investing in both the stocks themselves and forex while hedged is just the stocks?

Which ones do you prefer for long term?

With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles. The company has already delivered millions of new fiber miles, network capacity upgrades and high-speed connectivity enhancements in 2025, building the network infrastructure enterprises need to power their AI workloads.

“AI is fueling a surge in network demand like we’ve never seen, and Lumen is building the backbone to meet it,” said Kye Prigg, executive vice president, enterprise operations, Lumen Technologies. ""This isn’t incremental – we plan to more than double the size of our U.S. network. We’re positioning Lumen as the trusted network for AI, ensuring our customers have the network scale, speed, and reliability to confidently innovate and grow without constraints.”

**2025 milestones on the road to 47 million intercity fiber miles****^(1)****:**

* **Deployed New Fiber:** Added more than **2.2 million new intercity fiber miles**(2,500+ route miles) and projected to reach 16.6 million total intercity fiber miles by year end. Lumen is utilizing next-generation fiber optic cable from Corning Incorporated to fit two times more fiber into existing conduit.
* **Constructed Signal Boosters:** Construction efforts underway at **176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites**. ILA shelters built on these sites serve as giant signal boosters along the Lumen network with up to triple the power density compared to traditional ILA shelters and are designed to be updated, renewed, and scaled for the future.
* **Expanded Conduit Access:** Completed **IRU conduit deployments across 55 additional routes** expanding Lumen’s ability to add and control fiber on these routes by securing long-term rights to underground pathways.
* **Increased Network Capacity:** Added **5.9+ Pbps of total capacity** to the Lumen network so far this year, preparing to deliver the bandwidth needed to handle large volumes of data processing.
* **Extended Faster Speeds**: Earmarked more than **$100 million to bring high-speed connectivity** up to 400Gbps across clouds, data centers, and metros, creating a more seamless, high-performance pipeline for AI workloads. **The Lumen 400G-enabled network now spans more than 100,000 route miles**.

Lumen Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) is designed for AI workloads. By using fiber with 25% less optical loss than competitors^(2) and 60% more capacity than traditional designs, PCF helps move data more efficiently and at greater scale. The Lumen network achieves latency less than five milliseconds at the edge, covering up to 97% of U.S. business demand. And with diverse routes connecting more than 50 major cities, Lumen operates the largest ultra-low-loss intercity fiber network in North America.

“Every mile of new fiber and capacity upgrade adds to the strength of our Private Connectivity Fabric. Lumen is doing more than expanding infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for the AI economy,” added Prigg.",16,13,2025-09-26 07:46:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqv9l4/lumen_accelerates_multibilliondollar_network/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.648288

1nqm5g2,stocks,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

1nqft68,stocks,UPST: AI + Finance with BIG squeeze potential at play!,"$UPST (Upstart) is a AI powered lending platform and currently have around a **26%** float short with **3.2** days to cover. In 2021 they hit almost **$400** per share and with the lower interest rate environment their fundamentals are drastically improving again!

**Why it’s squeezable**

* **Short interest:** **\~21.1M shares** short = **\~26.3%** of float; **days to cover \~3.2**.
* **Float:** \~**84.1M** shares.
* **Borrow dynamics:** IBKR **CTB \~0.4–0.6%** lately; available shares fluctuating (\~150k–350k seen). If price trends up, borrow can dry up fast.

**Fundamentals massively improving**

* **Q2’25 revenue:** **$257M, +\~102% YoY.**
* **GAAP net income:** **+$5.6M** (vs. loss a year ago).
* **Volume:** loans +\*\*\~159% YoY\*\*, dollar volume **\~$2.8B**.
* Balance sheet and guidance commentary point to continued normalisation of funding.

**Macro tailwind**

* **U.S. Q2 GDP revised to 3.8% annualized**, a solid backdrop for risk assets and consumer credit cyclicals like UPST

**Price targets**

* Street 12 month PTs cluster around **$81 avg** (range **$47–$108**), implying notable upside from here. However, this could go MUCH higher with the interest rate cuts now planned and their improving financials - plus with the squeeze potential.

**Catalysts**

* Next earnings + any funding/partner expansions
* Options OI building into earnings can add fuel too

**Levels I’m watching**

* Break/hold above recent supply zone = go time, invalidation is a decisive close back below the last higher low so watch for this...

**Thesis:** Shorts are crowded into a name that just flipped back to profitable with triple digit revenue growth, right as macro prints strong. If UPST clears resistance with momentum then its going to blow up...

1nq6s8e,stocks,Intel jumps 8%… while Marvell spends $5B on buybacks,"This morning while scrolling through Bitget’s RWA perpetual futures index, I stumbled on something I honestly didn’t expect: **Intel pumping +8%** and Marvell announcing a $5 billion share buyback. I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

What do you think? Can Intel really reinvent itself for the long run, or is this just a short-term rebound?",145,119,2025-09-25 13:28:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq6s8e/intel_jumps_8_while_marvell_spends_5b_on_buybacks/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.648546

Copper prices jumped Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) declared force majeure on contracted supplies from its Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",36,2,2025-09-25 11:00:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq3oqn/copper_price_spikes_on_freeports_grasberg_force/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.648611

1npymnn,stocks,HSBC breaks new ground in quantum-enabled algorithmic trading with IBM quantum computers,">Global financial services company HSBC has announced the world’s first-known evidence for the potential of quantum computers to solve valuable problems in the field of algorithmic bond trading. In an ongoing collaboration with IBM®, researchers combined quantum and classical computational resources to analyze its own real-world, production-scale bond trading data. The hybrid quantum-classical methods employed by the HSBC-IBM team yielded up to a 34% improvement over purely classical techniques for predicting which trades would be completed.

1nprxr3,stocks,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",258,114,2025-09-24 21:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.648779

> Regulators are moving to dismantle one of the most controversial barriers for active retail traders the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday approved amendments that would replace the long-standing threshold, making active day trading more accessible to smaller accounts. The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

> The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.

> FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one’s intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.

1npgy3w,stocks,Question about a financial advisor’s choices,"I have a general question for folks who have long-term experience with financial advisors. I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it’s clear that such an approach makes managing client’s accounts much less labor intensive, and if one’s clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it’s easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

1npgter,stocks,Stagflation Sell-off Incoming,"Unemployment rate is ticking up and the Fed has described their dual mandate: lowering unemployment rate while making sure inflation doesn't run up on us.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,stocks,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.  

The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news.

Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.",35,71,2025-09-24 15:30:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npf99s/fermi_america_ipo_is_this_legit/,2025-10-03 09:03:39.648938

1npc6fd,stocks,$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388,"In my first post ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) I hinted (very strongly!) that FDA minutes for Cidara's ""End of Phase 2"" meeting could be a major turning point for Cidara. That news is now official, and it’s even stronger than expected:

**1. Phase 3 accelerated**

* Start pulled forward by 6 months:  enrollment begins Fall ’25 in the Nothern Hemisphere, not Spring ’26 as previously planned.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2–3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ≥65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ≥65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the “binary biotech discount” the market is still applying to CD388.

**What’s next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA’s help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it’s still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388’s long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today’s FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today’s FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.”

In my next post, I’ll do a deeper dive into why CD388’s probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

1npbyeg,stocks,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

WeRide, the company that has been creating quite the buzz with their global deployments, and partnerships, has just added themselves to the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index.

What I find interesting is that this index is referenced by a lot of funds seeking exposure to a specific investible tech sector of the US-listed names. So this index inclusion could potentially spark a wave of institutional investment which just feels like a stamp of confidence.

They have certainly been posting some solid numbers as well: revenues were up 60.8% YoY in Q2 with their Robotaxi revenue line up over 800%. Not to mention they are the first and only publicly traded company with L4 permits in 7 countries.

They seem to be less hype and traction focused and more focused on actual deployment and execution with an obvious growth pattern.

1np25et,stocks,Why do people trade stocks instead of just holding for the long term?,"I’ve always been told that long term investing is the best strategy for most people. Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is “time in the market beats timing the market,” and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you’ll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

Been looking at some periodic rebalancing of my holdings in my long-term portfolio, and I'm both in VOO and VYM. I liked having a mix, and VYM is known for its dividend yield, AND also how it weathered the 2022 bear market. I'm having trouble finding the tools on Fidelity to compare both, including their dividends. While VYM only did +76% over the last 5yrs, and VOO around +101%, VYM carries the dividend factor that offsets some of that gap and brings it closer.

What's your take on it, and where should I be looking forward?

I've also begun investing in VGT, which is the tech sector - which I think is a hot one right now. Over 5yrs, that one did +145%!

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> “Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they’ll price things in,” Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates. Though Powell noted the lofty equity values, he said this is “not a time of elevated financial stability risks.”",1100,169,2025-09-23 18:56:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1noq1ae/fed_chief_powell_says_stock_prices_appear_fairly/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.031581

> On the heels of Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, two research notes out today suggest the current boom in AI may be unsustainable.
> 
> “AI machines - in quite a literal sense - appear to be saving the U.S. economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to clients. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the U.S. would be close to, or in, recession this year.”

The bad news is that in order for the tech cycle to continue contributing to GDP growth, capital investment needs to remain parabolic. This is highly unlikely.”

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems). The company recently added NWL, which brings recurring industrial and defense power sales. They seem to be a differentiated niche leader. AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don’t, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I’m curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there’s as much upside left here as it seems.

1nodlp3,stocks,How to manage my Ørsted holdings,"I have a small holding in the Danish energy engineering company Ørsted A/S (ORSTED:CPH). Recently, Interactive Brokers notified me of the subscription rights offering, and I chose a number of share rights that I'd like to participate.

What I thought would happen next, is that I'd need to have cash in the account on the upcoming date September 29th in order to get the new ""ORSTED T"" shares. But instead, the shares have already appeared in my account since a day or two ago, with a cost shown as 0 DKK and they are already trading (i.e. they went up with 40% unrealised gain, and I sold a small number of them already).

But outside of Interactive Brokers, I cannot get the market price or information on these ORSTED-T units, for example Google Finance or Financial Times market data. This is problematic for me since I manage all my holdings in a Google Sheet.

Additionally, the IBKR message has popped up a second time about a voluntary CA Election. It says that of my remaining ORSTED-T holdings, I can further subscribe them to another election.

I just cant help but think the TikTok deal was built into that outlook. Oracle said they signed 3 multi billion dollar contracts but didn’t say which ones. They projected rev this year to be 18B, and by 2029 144B annually. This kind of projected growth by a tech dinosaur, in my opinion should not be met with the kind of surge we just saw.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",83,45,2025-09-22 22:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.031932

1nny89w,stocks,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",2,19,2025-09-22 20:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.031993

I think in time she will appreciate it and actually see the benefits of it as she is pretty “economical” in her thinking already and she is asking me from time to time how my shares are doing. She might also even start to add some herself in time.

But then comes the question, what stock? I’m torn between something she would actually have a relation to, like the company itself. Or a stock that is not to expensive and would do good. Preferably both of this.

We live in Scandinavia if that helps with the cultural context and she’s into gaming like Roblox and really enjoys K-pop (Katseye) and music. She’s also into makeup and is overall quite creative.

Perhaps Spotify or Roblox but I feel these would be a bit to hefty entry.

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

1nntg89,stocks,"In a low rates environment, nearly all equities are winners. Why stocks only go up. (For now).","It feels like, no matter the bad news, equities just keep climbing. Here’s the(my) reasoning as to why this is happening and why it'll likely continue.

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",52,30,2025-09-22 17:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.032075

For years, Microsoft has been seen as OpenAI's exclusive partner, providing the Azure cloud infrastructure and integrating OpenAI's models deeply into its ecosystem. They had a deal for a huge chunk of OpenAI's profits and seemed to be in the driver's seat.

Now, Nvidia isn't just a supplier anymore; they're a massive strategic investor.

Does this mean Microsoft's influence is significantly reduced? Is their ""special relationship"" with OpenAI over? Are they now just one of two major partners, or does the Nvidia deal sideline them in the long run? It seems like OpenAI is diversifying its dependencies in a big way.

1nnrwmq,stocks,3 oncology stocks I’m watching right now!,"Barclays recently highlighted several opportunities in the Oncology and I&I sector, which made me take a closer look at healthcare stocks. After digging, I narrowed it down to 3 that caught my attention:

1. Eli Lilly (LLY) – With its advanced immuno-oncology pipeline and existing blockbusters, it feels almost unavoidable. What stands out is their ability to diversify revenue while staying a leader in such a competitive field.


2. Pfizer (PFE) – Known for vaccines, but their oncology division is getting stronger with targeted acquisitions. Despite the post-COVID slump, I think they remain a solid long-term player in cancer treatment.


3. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) – Probably one of the most robust oncology portfolios. Their CAR-T therapies look very promising, and while the stock price isn’t exploding right now, I believe it’s one to keep on the radar.



The only issue on my side: I’m still pretty new to stocks.  I noticed that some crypto platforms like Bitget are starting to list tokenized US stocks and RWAs, I’m not sure if that is very similar to traditional broker.

>""Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers based around Nvidia’s AI chips, the companies said on Monday.

>OpenAI plans to operate Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, the companies said on Monday. A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips.

>The partnership highlights how linked OpenAI and Nvidia are as two of the biggest drivers of the recent artificial intelligence boom.

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further.

1nnpqxs,stocks,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",993,343,2025-09-22 15:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.032197

1nnpcoc,stocks,Can Google Avoid a Breakup Twice?,"In a landmark decision this month, a federal judge spared Google from a breakup proposed by the government to rein in the company’s monopoly in search.

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

1nnk82c,stocks,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they’ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the “Golden Age” of nuclear energy.

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.  
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will £20 within the next 12 months =  74% higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

1nnbjm5,stocks,Could the potential invasion of Eastern Europe by Russia cause a crash in markets?,"With Russia escalating alongside the eastern border of NATO countries it seems ever more likely that a full scale war across Europe could break out. I understand it’s pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? 

Russia’s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn’t seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. 

Historically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven’t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don’t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn’t affect global markets like a war in Europe would. I also assume investing in defense contractors would turn out to be very profitable.

1nn8wd5,stocks,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",145,91,2025-09-22 00:59:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nn8wd5/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.032458

1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",44,47,2025-09-20 18:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm567c/the_future_of_rddt_stock/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.032637

1nm2ecd,stocks,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can’t lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

Let’s be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?  

Sure Google could or whatever company could be the next Enron and you lose it all, but that risk is no different than you taking out a big business loan to start a business and your business fails.

1nlxych,stocks,ETFs that benefit from the likely multiple interest rate cuts and a probable strong Q4.,"**SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**:  It has a clean 10% run from late May that holds into September, which breaks the historical trend that is known for low volume and choppy price action.  This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,stocks,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies → spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies → futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they’re cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What’s wilder: the effect isn’t uniform.

* Banking & IT → bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma → high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos → low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

1nlsjr7,stocks,Investment Strategy,"Hello everyone. 

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. 

How can I remain cold & calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money & focus on my new strategy?",1,11,2025-09-20 08:15:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlsjr7/investment_strategy/,2025-10-03 09:03:41.032839
1nlrvhd,stocks,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

1nlleqw,stocks,Loaded 70% of my portfolio into BMNR how scary could dilution get?,"Just went pretty heavy on BMNR , about $7k, which is 70% of my portfolio.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here’s what another raise might look like:
	•	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that’s roughly 33M new shares → about 15% dilution.
	•	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that’s 66M shares → closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	•	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it’s only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

Historically, they tend to announce raises when share price + ETH price are strong so I’d expect the next dilution within the next 3–6 months if conditions stay favorable.

My big fear is: if they hit us with a big raise and the market sells off, this could easily drop to $55 or even $49 support levels fast.

On top of a bullish policy environment, both companies have large stockpiles of cash with NNE sitting on enough to cover expenses for the next 6-9 years.

1nlg2xj,stocks,International index could outperform US stocks,"VXUS (Vanguard international index) has been outperforming VTI (Vanguard total stock index) since February. I have a simple hypothesis that is being proven correct empirically: **Weakening dollar and overvalued US stocks will cause VSUX to outperform VTI**

Bogleheads are all too familiar with the theory 30-40% international diversification in their portfolios. But what about the rest of investors? Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement.

Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation. But I suspect that few winners will carry the lot, still resulting in broad market underperformance compared to internationals. It can't be ignored that solid international equities are much cheaper with reasonable PE relative to US hyper PE growth companies.

1nlf722,stocks,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

1nl7vt4,stocks,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


“In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.“",46,16,2025-09-19 16:14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl7vt4/jerome_powell_on_the_labor_market_and_why_they/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.320189
1nl5dx7,stocks,Nvidia explores $500 million investment in UK self-driving startup Wayve,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-explores-500-million-investment-085113334.html

> U.S. chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) has signed a letter of intent for a possible $500 million investment in the next funding round at Britain's Wayve, the autonomous driving technology group said on Thursday. The development comes after Britain and the United States signed a technology pact aimed at boosting ties in artificial intelligence and other fields. Founded in 2017, Wayve raised over $1 billion last year, led by SoftBank Group and supported by Nvidia. Ride-hailing platform Uber had also made a separate investment in the firm in 2024, for an undisclosed sum.

> Wayve's technology, unlike conventional systems that rely on detailed digital maps and coding, uses machine learning with camera sensors mounted on the vehicles to learn from traffic patterns and driver behaviour. Its autonomous driving platforms have been powered by a partnership with Nvidia, whose chips are now bolstering a global AI boom. The London-based Wayve currently operates in Britain and the U.S. and has been expanding testing and development to wider markets like Germany and Japan.",118,30,2025-09-19 14:40:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl5dx7/nvidia_explores_500_million_investment_in_uk/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.320197

1nl2uoj,stocks,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out ( [A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).  The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ≥10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388’s potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic “insurance value”** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

 

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.      End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ’25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.  May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on  Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.      BARDA decision on grant application.  CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

1nl2mkd,stocks,"SEC to propose rule change on Trump’s call to end quarterly earnings reporting, says Chair Atkins","Paul Atkins, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, made the remarks on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump proposed the idea that companies should no longer provide earnings reports on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. The SEC said the agency is actively looking into that plan.

“At President Trump’s request, Chairman \[Paul\] Atkins and the SEC is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies,” an agency spokesperson said earlier.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed by just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat.

1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",117,56,2025-09-19 11:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.320281

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,stocks,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.",48,37,2025-09-19 03:00:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nksav5/ups_has_a_limited_downside_from_this_price/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.320422

Its stock has been trending down in recent months due to slow guidance and potential AI and low-code platforms chipping away at their core business, which is vertical software solutions in niche spaces such as healthcare, agriculture, utilities, and transportation.

What do folks think are good questions to ask to grasp their plan for AI, and what do you think their responses will be?

> But Intel’s foundry business has struggled to find outside customers and fallen badly behind rivals on adopting market-leading manufacturing processes. Building up a foundry business is crucial for Intel to execute its turnaround and compete more closely with the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
>
> “This looks like a product deal, not a foundry deal,” at least at the moment, Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note. “But frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding.”

...

> The agreement shows how some industry executives view efforts to help Intel as a way to win favor with the Trump administration. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son saw his recent investment in Intel as a way to appeal to the president.
> 
> Trump administration officials have been talking to Huang and other chip-industry leaders from AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for months about how they could potentially help Intel. Lutnick has discussed possible financial help and ways they could boost Intel’s manufacturing business.

...

> Because of the government’s involvement in both Nvidia and Intel, many around the industry raised an eyebrow at Thursday’s deal.
>
> “It is perhaps unprecedented that a company with a unique revenue sharing agreement with the U.S. government is investing so much money in a company that’s partially owned by the U.S. government,” said Ryan Fedasiuk, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

> One of Huang’s top priorities is getting Trump administration approval for a version of Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU - its leading-edge AI processor - for sale in China. Trump has said that he would consider giving an export license to such a chip if its capabilities were reduced by 30% or more.

This makes me doubt the long term prospects for Intel here. It seems like Nvidia is investing this money to help their China export prospects and gain favor with the current admin, and it won't help Intel's foundry struggles.. so that means TSMC will likely continue being the winner regardless

1nkcgmg,stocks,$CDTX presenting CD388 H5 bird flu study results tomorrow,"Cidara will be presenting results from their **H5N1 (Bird Flu) study** tomorrow at the [8th AVG and 3rd IMRP 2025 Meetings - ISRV](https://www.isrv.global/featured-events/imrp-2025/) in Singapore.

Why it matters:

* **H5 is high-mortality flu** with pandemic potential.
* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow’s readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that’s additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.
* Governments care about (and pay for!) **pandemic preparedness**. Positive H5 data could bolster the case for BARDA stockpiling, the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst for Cidara.

My baseline rNPV ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) only accounts for seasonal high-risk cohorts in High Income Countries (HICs).

Strong H5 data increases the probability of **optional upside** :  
• Pandemic preparedness contracts (BARDA, ex-U.S. stockpiles).  
• A strong pandemic countermeasure story supports the strategic “insurance value” of CD388 and could lead to a reduction in the “skepticism discount” that seems to be currently applied to the asset.

The results won’t change my conservative base case on valuation right away, but it adds meaningful **optionality that isn’t included in my model yet**.

The buybacks of class B shares in Embracer will be carried out by SB1 Markets, which, independently of Embracer, will decide on the buybacks and the timing of the buybacks.

>The purpose of the buybacks within the buyback program is to reduce the share capital of Embracer in order to optimize Embracer's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. Therefore, the board of directors intends to propose that the repurchased shares under the program are cancelled by way of a reduction of Embracer's share capital no later than at the annual general meeting 2026.

The shares shall be purchased at a price no higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent purchase bid on Nasdaq Stockholm and in accordance with the restrictions relating to price in the Safe Harbor Regulation.
Buybacks may only be effected in accordance with the restrictions regarding volume for acquisitions of own shares stated in the Rulebook and in the Safe Harbor Regulation.
The maximum cumulative repurchase amount is SEK 500 million. In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the mandate that is proposed to the annual general meeting today, Embracer may not buy more shares that would bring Embracer’s holding of own shares to ten percent of all shares in Embracer.
Payment for shares will be made in cash.

1nk3147,stocks,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

basically they use AI , analytics and consulting to help ecommerce brands optimize marketing channels and relevant data. 

to be aligned with their partners , they actually purchase inventory from their brand partners and help them sell through on the global marketplace direct to consumer

some key financials pulled from their s-1

revenue climbed 29% from 1.366b to 1.796b from 2023 to 2024

gross margin from 44% to 43.5% from 2023 to 2024

the company is in a rare position these days to have stable profits and operating cash flows before IPO 

19.8m net profit in 2023 to 42.5m in 2024

the IPO at its current range would price the company at 2.7x sales. this seems quite undervalued to me for topline growing close to 30% and with stable cash flows and profits

1njz0vw,stocks,When do you guys take Profits for long term stocks?,"As the title says, how do you guys determine when to take profits? I've held some stocks (BAC, AMZN, GOOG, SOFI, and a few others), that I have had for years (so I won't be taxed at short gain tax at least).

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account. How do you all decide to take profit (minus life changing choices events like buying a house, medical or other type of emergency, etc etc)? Or are you all just planning to hold these types of stocks till retirement as well?

1njy059,stocks,Zillow Will Benefit Strongly From A Housing Rebound,"**Zillow (Z) $90.75,  Planning to add tomorrow morning**

**Industry/Sector/Type - - - Housing Marketplace/Platform/Steady growth tied to housing cyclicality.**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It’s asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak. Existing home and new home sales peaked around Q1-2022 at 6.1Mn and 1Mn units respectively. Now, they’re down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What’s positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.  Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,  growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter’s earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they’re just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass’ use of private “pocket listings,” reduces the availability of listings on Zillow’s site, attacking Zillow’s business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow’s appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

However, if housing recovers, we're still getting in close to the market trough. More importantly, Zillow has used the housing downturn to emerge stronger and gain market share at the expense of weaker rivals.

1njv8wk,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I. Miran, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber’s endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1njfr5i,stocks,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

My crystal ball says uranium and nuclear will be in big demand for some time to come.",31,35,2025-09-17 15:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njfr5i/uraniumnuclear_equities_irrationally_sinking_due/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.321107
1njffif,stocks,Bill Ackman Insurance acquisition TBA soon at 09/30 annual meeting?,"Previously Bill Ackman for HHH mentioned that he was looking to acquire a 1-3B+ insurance co following the model of Warren Buffett. 

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

1njednu,stocks,A deep dive into the autonomous robobus market: the renault-weride partnership,"I've been tracking the autonomous vehicle space like tesla to find a good point to sell it, and the news about weride caught my attention. their plan to launch a mass-produced robobus by 2030 for the european market seems like a big shift.

This partnership raises some interesting questions for me. for a while, the market's been obsessed with robotaxis, but the b2b robobus model seems more stable, with predictable, long-term revenue. how do we value a company focused on this niche, given that most of the public comps are in the robotaxi space?

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play. I'm curious to hear other traders' thoughts on this. is the robobus market a more stable segment for autonomous driving? how do you factor in strategic partnerships and regulatory wins into your analysis?",5,0,2025-09-17 14:16:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njednu/a_deep_dive_into_the_autonomous_robobus_market/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.321148

**Yields from Treasury bonds** and other U.S. government securities are **subject to Federal tax but exempt from state and local income taxes.**

**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **GOVZ (iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF):** The most aggressive option, holding zero-coupon STRIPS. Its long duration makes it extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. It is a high-risk investment and not typically for investors seeking broad Treasury exposure.

1njcyl8,stocks,Lyft stock soars 20% on Waymo Nashville robotaxi deal,"Waymo has partnered with Uber to get its robotaxis into Atlanta and Austin, Texas. Now it’s teaming up with Lyft for the first time in a commercial deal to enter Nashville next year.

Lyft stock rocketed 20% higher on the news.

Riders in Nashville will be able to hail a Waymo robotaxi through the Waymo One app, and Lyft will add Waymo robotaxis to its platform over time, the companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Lyft “will provide end-to-end fleet management services including vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations in Nashville,” for the Waymo fleet, the companies said.

Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, has taken a big lead in the U.S. robotaxi market, launching in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. It surpassed 10 million paid trips in May, and has plans to start commercial operations next year in Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, and now Nashville.

Methinks Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is now safe from removal. Too many of the rich in the Administration have abused the “primary residence” mortgage loophole for them to punish her. 

Turns out the accusations painted the accusers. 

Broadly speaking, these multiple cases of mortgage fraud and “incongruity” show that the distinction about criminal fraud relies on intent.

1nj9v93,stocks,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,stocks,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too.

It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

**The bigger question:**

- Are we seeing the real start of urban air mobility, or is this just another news-fueled pump before a long wait on certification?

- Can these fleets actually scale like ridesharing, or will costs/noise/local politics kill it?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1nic0sv,stocks,"Ørsted Initiates EUR 8 Billion Rights Issue to Build Sunrise Wind, Cover Revolution Wind Halt Impact","Ørsted (Denmark) is launching the rights issue announced last month, offering new shares with pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders during the period from 19 September to 2 October 2025. The company is looking to raise DKK 60 billion (around EUR 8 billion) to fund the construction of the Sunrise Wind project in New York and enhance its financial flexibility, which also includes helping to cover any impact the recently issued federal stop-work order for Revolution Wind may have.

Since the developer was unable to secure a partial divestment of Sunrise Wind and the associated project financing, as per its usual business model, Ørsted needs to fund the construction of the entire 924 MW offshore wind project on its own balance sheet, which requires an incremental funding of approximately DKK 40 billion (around EUR 5.4 billion), according to the developer.

1ni9frw,stocks,Senate confirms Trump Adviser Miran as Fed Governor right before this week's Fed Meeting.,"Stephen Miran is the new nominee to the Federal Reserve Board in an incredibly tight 48-47 vote on Monday evening.  He'll be just in time to cast a crucial vote in this week's central bank policy meeting.

The Fed is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year.

""Miran's confirmation is part of a larger effort by the president to pack the Fed with members who favor lower rates.""

""Miran told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee that he would act independently if confirmed, but he does not intend to resign from his current White House position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Instead, he would opt to take a leave of absence from the White House to serve on the central bank and then return after his term is up.""

1nhxe5d,stocks,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

This is just my idea, of course, not advice. I am very interested to hear what you think. Am I missing something? Let me know your thoughts and if you see any mistakes in my thinking.",0,23,2025-09-15 20:36:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhxe5d/echostar_sats_seems_massively_undervalued_after/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.321502

1nhozun,stocks,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",251,243,2025-09-15 15:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,2025-10-03 09:03:42.321543

1nhof8h,stocks,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhnjwm,stocks,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

1nh9zzg,stocks,Thoughts on $LULU?,"Lululemon has been having a rough time this year. Their stock went down more than 40%.

1nh5i4r,stocks,$OPEN - this is some bullshit,"About 3 weeks ago, the current president of OPEN made a relatively small open market purchase of his own stock - $OPEN, along with a highly positive tweet. His filing is here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X03/wk-form4\_1756411509.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X03/wk-form4_1756411509.xml)

While he bought just 128,000 dollars at 4 dollars a share, the subsequent 100% increase in value of OPEN stock since then shot his worth in the company from 16 million to 32 million in 17 days. That's about a million a day. Must be nice.

1ngvvff,stocks,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

1ngvaz4,stocks,Hennessy funds recommends these top 3 small caps to become GIANTS,"Josh Wein, a VP & key 5 star portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, who manages 10 of the funds worth collectively 3B in AUM, recently mentioned that these 3 top small caps are his favorite to become giants.

**$ROOT insurance:**

ROOT insurance is an insurance company with a 1.5B market-cap that underwrites risk utilizing AI targeting safe drivers, which allows them to have less risk & better profit margins than their legacy peers. ROOT although small, has been beating legacy insurers on all metrics all around, including pricing, loss ratios, and a forward efficient tech stack. ROOT has recently partnered with the biggest names in auto including Toyota, Hyundai, CVNA, Experian, etc, which now sports 20+ major partners strong, and many more to come. Their partnership channel has been growing at 3x YoY, and you quickly realize why Josh thinks ROOT could end up being a giant one day.

**$COMP**

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

**$WMK Weis Markets Inc**

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

are there any other small caps that you would suggest other than what Wein has recommended?",0,14,2025-09-14 16:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngvaz4/hennessy_funds_recommends_these_top_3_small_caps/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751700

It’s basically a Luxembourg-based satellite outfit running the Astra satellites + O3b stuff. What’s kinda dope is they’re not just GEO like the old guys but also got a MEO constellation, so the latency’s lower and coverage’s wider than some of the newer LEO kids.

Money-wise it’s a bit of a mixed bag tbh. Revenues are in the billions € but profits are meh. They just finished buying Intelsat which could be a huge deal if they don’t mess up the integration. Dividend’s juicy at \~7% but obviously that comes with risk – heavy capex, debt, Starlink breathing down their neck etc.

Anyway, I’m personally thinking of opening a small position for the dividend and to see how the Intelsat integration goes. Not financial advice, DYOR.",6,4,2025-09-14 15:50:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nguqsy/ses_sa_sesg_stock_thoughts/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751739
1ngujqq,stocks,Mag 7: exposure to AI downside,"Hi everyone,

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

P.S.: My current Mag7 top pick for the medium-long term is Alphabet.",90,83,2025-09-14 15:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngujqq/mag_7_exposure_to_ai_downside/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751765

1ngogkq,stocks,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",13,98,2025-09-14 11:06:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751806

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

1nfj3ri,stocks,Why I’m selling $RDDT even though I think it has great growth potential,"(Purely on vibes, no fundamental analysis)

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it’s a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House’s bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against “the violent left.” High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They’ve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit’s growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms. If Reddit refuses, the administration will pursue many options to punish Reddit, like tying it up in lawsuits or preventing other companies from doing business with Reddit.

Either way, this should significantly affect Reddit stock price.

Could I be wrong and then RDDT runs up some more? Of course, but I’m already up 450% and won’t lose any sleep from selling it.",0,31,2025-09-13 00:06:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfj3ri/why_im_selling_rddt_even_though_i_think_it_has/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751955
1nfgpnp,stocks,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn’t sit right with me anymore. I’m not doing anything fancy like options these days. I’m a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side. Really appreciate all the perspectives though. And yeah, I have to admit the Fidelity app and website feel a little old school, but hey… at least it’s better than Vanguard’s lol.",499,289,2025-09-12 22:19:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfgpnp/finally_leaving_robinhood_after_a_decade/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.751981

> Shares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.  The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,” the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer’s stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored” by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries. Systems across the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe have not identified “any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women,” Moderna added.",928,166,2025-09-12 21:51:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfg181/pfizer_moderna_shares_fall_on_report_that_trump/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.752010

Kind of annoying since if they were serious about IPO flipping they would just outright prohibit you from doing it.

1nfa1qo,stocks,Follow-up: Why flu vaccine economics shouldn’t apply to Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 universal flu prophylaxis,"In response to my earlier post asking if Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” was the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I received a number of comments that begged the question:  Why should CD388 be priced any differently than flu vaccines?

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn’t a vaccine! It **doesn’t depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they’re protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don’t deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value – economic or otherwise.  That’s why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this “icing on the cake” from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I’ll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I’ve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.",9,11,2025-09-12 17:55:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfa1qo/followup_why_flu_vaccine_economics_shouldnt_apply/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.752130

* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nex7fd,stocks,Puts on Duolingo,"Been watching this stock for a while.

It had a surge yesterday and is now sitting at $310, still down from its ath of $545. This upward movement came from 2 analysts increasing their price target to $400.

It had a similar spike back on August 18th when it increased to $370, which was then followed by a large sell off down to $270. Same reason, an analyst made an upgrade.

Being that its still in a bearish trend, I view this spike in share price as a good time to buy puts, curious what yall think?

I think it will continue down the rest of this month, but may rally leading up to earnings.

1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks… are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty.

The expected inflation, combined with an increasingly weak job market, sets the stage for the expected next week's Fed interest rate cut. There was a 92% chance of a 25 bp cut and 8% chance of a 50 bp cut prior to this morning's CPI report.

After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)


Thank you regards for reading this far. The same fundamentals as any other slept-on stock applies to this one. Buy and hold, check the next interest report coming out on 09/15, etcetera. If any oldheads read this post, please fact check my ass. I'm trying to navigate this into as much profit as I can possibly take myself.

In addition to softer employment and worse PMI prints, the market is pricing in slower U.S. consumption.

However, a supply shock may quickly pressure prices because OPEC+ is still holding cutbacks, the number of shale rigs in the United States is at multi-year lows, and there isn't much spare capacity in the world.

1ndyrdb,stocks,"$SOUN, $OPEN, $RR","Been watching on $SOUN, $OPEN, $RR for a while. I’ve got a few things to point out:

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

1ndye8q,stocks,Vanguard vs Robinhood - should I switch?,"I am an 18 year old with a pretty good amount of money saved up. Right now, I have nearly all of my funds in VTSAX. I am on the verge of transferring my funds to robinhood on a 2% transfer deal they have right now (I’d make the maximum 500 dollars from that). I also do know to keep the 500 dollars, I’d have to hold my money in Robinhood for 5 years, which I don’t really plan on taking money out anyway.

In Robinhood, I’d probably just hold VTI because they do not have VTSAX, and I feel like one huge advantage to this is being able to buy IPOs when they release, as they seem to be constantly doubling these days. Also, Robinhood makes it significantly easier to sell and buy shares of stock.

Also, robinhood allows me to trade with like 100k margin or something crazy along those lines. Would it not just be smart to throw that in an index fund?",0,48,2025-09-11 03:25:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndye8q/vanguard_vs_robinhood_should_i_switch/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.752692

1ndt2go,stocks,"CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?","New to reddit and looking for a second set of eyes on one of my investments.

I’ve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a “universal flu med” for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share × ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 → ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) → ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV → $445–530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just “clinical-stage biotech = high risk” until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they’re positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7–8× upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

1ndkcue,stocks,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",29,15,2025-09-10 17:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.752828

The cloud giant is on pace for its best day since 1999, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark

The company said it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.

“This is a very historic kind of print right here from Oracle with this backlog,” Ben Reitzes, technology research head at Melius Research, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The Street was looking for about $180 billion in RPO and they’re talking about a number that is a multiple of that. That is astounding.”

Oracle now sees $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, with the company calling for the annual sum to reach $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.

Other analysts were left “blown away” and “in shock.” D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria called it “absolutely staggering on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” Wells Fargo analysts said it was a “momentous confirmation” of the artificial intelligence trade.

1ndeclp,stocks,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",28,8,2025-09-10 13:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.752944
1ndd3ow,stocks,"August PPI rose 2.6% YOY, which is much less than the expected 3.3%","The increasingly weak job market is becoming more crucial in determining whether to lower the upcoming Fed interest rates, with the August PPI much lower than expected.

CME FedWatch is predicting a 91.7% chance of a 25 bp cut, and an 8.3% chance of a 50 bp cut.

(The chance of a 50 bp cut has edged up to 10% as of 11:13 AM)

August PPI was -0.1% MOM, which went down sharply from July’s 0.9% MOM unexpected jump.

Fed officials are mostly viewing tariffs as one-off price increases not likely to cause longer-lasting inflation.

1ndauza,stocks,Accenture ACN - what's your verdict?,"Hi

Basically what the title says. I looked at the fundamentals which I personally like.
ROE > 27%
ROIC > 19%
Gross margin > 30%
PE = 20
Forward PE = 18

It has growing numbers on top and bottom line. Its Free cash flow is increasing YoY. It has more cash than debt.

Only negative part IMO is that the growth projections are in the single digits, so it's not a high growth company.

On the other hand, it's current pull backs from its 2024 highs is quite significant. It sits where it was around 5 years ago where it is sitting on a rather strong support.

So all in all, ACN might be a company to keep an eye on.

1nd8ojp,stocks,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing?

NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday after the Israeli military said it carried out an attack on Hamas leadership in the Qatari capital Doha, an expansion of its military actions in the Middle East.

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that China will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against Russia.",27,1,2025-09-10 07:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.753023

1nd1djr,stocks,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",60,27,2025-09-10 01:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,2025-10-03 09:03:43.753104

1nctxgv,stocks,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data.

Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons.

1ncmtbq,stocks,How to recognize a counterfeit stock certificate?,"This is a strange situation and I am not well-versed in stock certificates at all. I appreciate any advice in advance.

I have a stock certificate in my name from my grandfather's company handed to me from my mother. My mother owns shares of stock as well and has been selling quite a bit, enough to save herself from working for the past five years.

I asked her for the phone number of the man who's been helping her sell it. She gave me a fake number. This was the first red flag. So I did some research and apparently, there is supposed to be a legend on the back of a stock certificate. The back of mine is completely blank. The front names the company, the amount of shares, and their value. The second red flag is that, if her shares are valued at the same as mine are, there is no way she has been able to receive as much money as she has. She has no other streams of income. 

Point is, I know I am being lied to about this. I have an idea for how I am going to obtain the guy's phone number, but is the back side of my certificate being blank a sign that the document is a counterfeit?",0,3,2025-09-09 15:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ncmtbq/how_to_recognize_a_counterfeit_stock_certificate/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.057637
1ncm3sk,stocks,Here's how dark pool data actually 'helped' my trading,"After years of trading, I finally started paying attention to dark pool prints and volume, honestly wasn't expecting much at first.. But after hearing a bunch of buddies in my trading discord go on and on about them, I got curious.

Recently, I noticed series of majors DP trades significantly below the market price for one of the stocks I follow. Over the course of the next hourr, price moved sharply up as if the public price was being ""pushed"" away from the dark pools. .I know that that sounds absurd, but that's exactly what the pattern looks like and it seems to happen regularly. If large dark pool activity happens far away from the publick price (like outside the bolligner bands) then the DPs seem to act as a repellent the and price moves away from them. That seems totally backwards, because I would think the the public price would move towards the DPs, but the patter seems to hold.

It's been a few weeks now and this probably only occurs a couple times per week acorss the few tickers I really follow, but so far it has been really reliable and predicitve.

1nclmnh,stocks,SRPT - binary outcome,"SRPT (Very high risk / reward).
Position: 15,000 shares at $18.20

Sarepta stock is down almost 90% due to two deaths related to its flagship gene therapy, Elevidys. It’s an expensive but highly unique solution to give children suffering from DMD a chance at a better life. 

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it’s still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they’re allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits. However, there is also a chance that it goes to $0 if their drug is permanently pulled for everyone (small chance, but not zero).",8,11,2025-09-09 15:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nclmnh/srpt_binary_outcome/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.057665
1ncj0ng,stocks,"Why are all EVTOLs posts focusing on Joby/Archer, while EH seems at least as promising, if not better ?","Every week there are new threads on this sub trying to pump Archer, and occasionally Joby, but I feel like the discourse here completely overlooks EHang, which is to me a much safer bet for the following reasons 


**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang’s strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

1ncin8g,stocks,(09/9) Interesting Stocks Today - The Real Winner of Succession is...,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Murdoch’s $3.3 Billion Succession Deal Hands Lachlan Control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/murdoch-family-settles-suit-over-trust-puts-lachlan-in-charge?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NBIS (Nebius)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)\- Nebius said it signed a multibillion‑dollar agreement to provide Microsoft with artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately spiked up to $110 yesterday and made a MASSIVE move afterhours, I'm primarily interested in seeing if we can continue that today. Watching $100 level. The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR. Does this have as much potential as CRCL? I'd say no, but I think that it is an interesting watch. The surge of crypto‑industry IPOs sparked by Circle’s $1.05 B listing has been part of the IPO market coming back. FIGR is aiming for an IPO that is half its size, and is decently profitable. Planning to write a DD on this. Main risk in this is that we get absolutely euphoric (we're already very euphoric in the IPO market lol).

[**FOX (Fox Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FOX&p=d)\- Lachlan Murdoch has won the game of Succession and the stock has drifted somewhat lower on this news-but it was done on such little volume we’ll have to wait until the market opens to see if FOX will stay down 5%.

[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\- Day 2 of being added (or at least, notifying everyone it will be added) to the S&P 500! primarily interested in if it can continue the momentum and break ATH (\~$117/\~117.70). TLDR stocks go up when added to the S&P 500 because index‑tracking funds and ETFs are forced to buy in.

1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1ncdql0,stocks,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited. We should neither dismiss it as useless nor praise it blindly.",34,35,2025-09-09 08:54:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ncdql0/thoughts_on_spacexs_acquisition_of_echostar/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.057845

1nbwetv,stocks,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,88,2025-09-08 18:54:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.057882

1nbq5q9,stocks,Treasury Secretary Bessent warns of massive refunds if the Supreme Court voids Trump tariffs,"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/07/trump-trade-supreme-court-refunds-bessent.html

> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he is “confident” that President Donald Trump’s tariff plan “will win” at the Supreme Court, but warned his agency would be forced to issue massive refunds if the high court rules against it.
> 
> If the tariffs are struck down, he said, “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” according to an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
> 
> He added, however, that “if the court says it, we’d have to do it.”
> 
> The Trump administration last week asked the Supreme Court for an “expedited ruling” to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal.
> 
> Generally, the Supreme Court could take as long as early next summer to issue a decision on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.
> 
> Bessent has said that “delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected, and unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”
> 
> The prospect of the government having to refund tariffs of that magnitude could mean an unprecedented windfall to the businesses and entities that paid them.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA. So this would mainly impact the retaliatory tariffs levied against every country",1489,215,2025-09-08 15:03:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbq5q9/treasury_secretary_bessent_warns_of_massive/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.057939

1nbm4tr,stocks,Motley called Archer a no-brainer industrial pick. Good things all around for the stock,"In their September 5 report, AOL labeled Archer Aviation as one of two industrial stocks worth considering right now, and for good reason

Although still early stage, Archer’s push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a “no-brainer” reflects growing recognition that Archer’s mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it’s steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling. 
It’s not just about flying taxis, it’s the transformation of urban and regional travel. That feels worth paying attention to, and keeping a positive lens on as we ride this story forward

If you recall, PPTA is on the verge of getting their final permits signed off. As well as gold, the property holds enough Antimony to supply up to 37% of the USA's requirements. America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",21,3,2025-09-08 02:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.058062

1nazqw0,stocks,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day’s low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally.

1napdma,stocks,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

1n9n3w3,stocks,Nestle has fired its CEO because he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpm9ee9p9o

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld. A spokesperson for Nestle said: ""We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance.",1554,133,2025-09-06 01:38:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9n3w3/nestle_has_fired_its_ceo_because_he_failed_to/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.058399
1n9jpac,stocks,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

1n9dojz,stocks,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath?

Last time top comments suggested other storage providers over STX & WD. But since then, 

STX up 3x

WD up 2x.

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",710,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.058572
1n96qiw,stocks,$LULU - has it bottomed?,"Yes, cheeky title.

You may remember me from such classics as “$LULU - the bar is low” where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it’s not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn’t the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick’s own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their “come to Jesus” moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can’t just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn’t succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it’s at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they’ve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They’re spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it’s not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable.

1n92hmm,stocks,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it’s worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?",58,53,2025-09-05 11:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n92hmm/achr_discussion_can_evtols_ever_be_profitable/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.058658

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.

Today these shares are worth $80.
Jim has made a big profit, but will be hit with a 20% gains tax if he sells.

Jim also has a large amount of cash available.
Does it make sense for Jim to buy a lot more of the stock for $80 per share and then sell everything immediately - will doing this increase the book price and therefore reduce the tax payable?

2. **Freddie Mac (FMCC):** 270% YTD.  See Fannie Mae.
3. **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)**: This data analytics company has seen a significant year-to-date increase, with some sources reporting gains over 100%.

But new technology is changing that. Some companies are learning how to turn plastics back into useful materials, make fuel from food or farm waste, and even pull rare metals from old electronics.

It makes me think about solar. Years ago, solar power was too costly and not advanced enough to matter. Now solar stocks are a big part of clean energy investing. Could recycling stocks follow the same path?

If the tech keeps improving, waste might not just be trash anymore. It could become something valuable, like a resource people invest in.

1n8aitu,stocks,American Eagle’s Earnings Blowout is Bullish for $GAP,"American Eagle stock shot up nearly 30% after their earnings yesterday afternoon citing the Sydney Sweeney ad as a driver for their sales. That’s right, the controversial Sydney Sweeney ad in which the clothes she’s wearing kinda look like shit actually boosted their clothing sales. That ad came out a month ago and has 8 million views on YouTube.

Gap released their denim ad with Katseye 2 weeks ago. The ad already has 15 million views on YouTube, the engagement is crazy across all social media, it is beloved by men and women of all ages, features diversity in an organic way, and the clothes look fucking amazing on those women. There’s a ton of analysis from marketing professionals praising Gap’s ability to capture the momentum from the Sydney Sweeney ad and put out something that appears to be much more successful and effective. 

Gap has been on an uptrend since their last earnings, and I’m confident the virality of the Katseye ad paired with the now proven effectiveness of the Sydney Sweeney ad through AEO’s earnings will keep Gap’s momentum going. I don’t think the market has appropriately priced in the potential effectiveness of the Katseye ad converting into sales, and $AEO’s last earnings provide some confirmation that more positive sentiment is justified. 

P/E is only 9.73, and market cap is about 8 billion. There is room to move.

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google’s ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney’s current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a “big win” for Apple.

“This has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they’ve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,” he said.

1n7q8at,stocks,Salesforce issues weak revenue guidance even as earnings beat estimates,"Salesforce issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, even as earnings and revenue topped estimates for the fiscal second quarter. The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
* **Revenue:** $10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected

Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.

For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.

Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to  $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.

Salesforce has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software and systems, it hasn’t been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.

Going into Wednesday’s report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year, lagging behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.

The ratio of Salesforce’s enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.

During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to increase the cost of some products and announced its intent to acquire data management software company Informatica for $8 billion.

1n7q103,stocks,Figma’s stock plunges after company’s first earnings report since IPO,"Figma shares plunged 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software company reported results for the first time since its IPO in July.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** breakeven
* **Revenue:** $249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected

Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July regulatory filing. CNBC isn’t including a profit estimate because it’s Figma’s first earnings report.

Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company’s adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little over $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.

In the second quarter, Figma announced Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user’s descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.

A number of software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said he’s not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.

“I think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,” Field said. He acknowledged that Figma has been adopting so-called vibe-coding tools for AI-driven software development.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% some employees’ stock after market close on Sept. 4. Investors holding just over half of Figma’s outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lock-up that will expire in August 2026 for about 35% of their shares.

Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.

“That’s something that I think is valuable information,” he said.

On Wednesday the company’s stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to $115.50 in its debut.

1n7pve1,stocks,"American Eagle stock soars 20% as it says Sydney Sweeney campaign is its ‘best’ to date, beats earnings","American Eagle said Wednesday its partnership with Sydney Sweeney has been its “best” advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. 

The company’s splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the “Euphoria” star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift’s new fiancé Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels. 

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

“The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,” CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. “We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.” 

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount. 

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 45 cents vs. 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier. 

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It’s expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.

> WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month in August as factories dealt with the fallout from the Trump administration's import tariffs, with some manufacturers describing the current business environment as ""much worse than the Great Recession.""
> 
> The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also showed some manufacturers complaining that the sweeping import duties were making it difficult to manufacture goods in the United States. President Donald Trump has defended his protectionist trade policy, which has raised the nation's average tariff rate to the highest in a century, as necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
> 
> That was reinforced by government data showing spending on the construction of factories dropped in July and was down 6.7% from a year ago. A U.S. appeals court ruled last Friday that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, adding more uncertainty for businesses.
> 
> ""I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets.
> 
> The ISM said its manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.7 last month from 48.0 in July. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI would rise to 49.0.
> 
> Seven industries, including textile mills, miscellaneous manufacturing and primary metals, reported growth last month. Among the 10 industries reporting contraction were makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products.
> 
> Tariffs continued to dominate commentary from manufacturers. Some makers of transportation equipment said conditions were worse than the 2007-09 recession, adding ""there is absolutely no activity"" and ""this is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created."" Some viewed the conditions as consistent with ""stagflation.""
> 
> Some electrical equipment, appliances and components producers complained that ""'made in the USA' has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components."" They said the ""administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles."" Others reported that because of the lack of ""stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen.""
> 
> Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said ""tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning and scheduling activities,"" adding that ""plans to bring production back into (the) U.S. are impacted by higher material costs, making it more difficult to justify the return.""",392,33,2025-09-03 17:46:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n7lo8f/us_manufacturing_contracts_for_sixth_straight/,2025-10-03 09:03:45.059088

1n7h3cq,stocks,Webull is undervalued by around 3x vs. Other brokerages. Nice value,"Webull (BULL) is crazy undervalued vs. Other brokerages

Webull (BULL) is currently trading around 13.2/share. It IPOd on 11Apr right at market lows. There was immediate interest sending the IPO price from $12 to $60, then a sell off to $11. 

Financials: 
Revenue Q1 = $117M
Revenue Q2 = $131.5M
Q3 projection = $150M 

Yes they have competition from other brokerages, but their market edge is lower trading fees and easy to use app. They now also permit other forms of trading which im not allowed to specify on this sub. 

So why webull? 

If you do a simple Revenue vs. Market cap comparison of brokerages, Webull is by far the most undervalued brokerage - likely because they recently had smaller market exposure pre-IPO and the IPO timing was horrible. 

Webull would be trading at $39/share using a revenue vs market cap vs. Share price comparison to other brokerages (aggregate). 

In other words, if Webulls financials were treated the same as other brokerages, it should simply be close to $40/share. 

$13/share is outrageously undervalued for this brokerage. Time and value will realize itself and Webull will be trading at $40/share soon. Just a matter of time.",15,72,2025-09-03 14:58:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n7h3cq/webull_is_undervalued_by_around_3x_vs_other/,2025-10-03 09:03:46.512708
1n7go4q,stocks,"Is ""see through inflation"" the next ""transitory inflation""?","Christopher Waller was on CNBC this morning interviewed by Steve Leishman.  It was your typical softball interview but there was one question that I thought was interesting.  He was asked if inflation continues to creep up and given that it is currently above the Fed's target rate would that cause the Fed to possibly not cut rates.  Waller proceeded to lecture the audience that what people don't understand is ""see through inflation"".  He said people don't understand that this is just temporary and caused by tariffs and you need to see through it and it will soon go away.  I guess by magic,  he didn't say what would cause it to go away. 

I was hoping that Leishman would bring up transitory inflation,  but no such luck. 

I think inflation continues to go up and employment goes down.  Not a good formula for stocks.

1n7gn4d,stocks,"Macy’s shares jump 20% as retailer tops earnings estimates, raises outlook","Macy’s posted fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday that easily topped Wall Street’s expectations, as it said revamped stores helped sales trends.

The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance. It now expects adjusted earnings of between $1.70 and $2.05 per share, compared with $1.60 to $2 per share, and revenue between $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion, compared with $21 billion to $21.4 billion.

The stock surged 20% in early trading on Wednesday.

Macy’s had slashed its full-year guidance last quarter and reported uncertainty in sales due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“We’re just well positioned right now for the environment we’re in to take share, to deliver for our customers and to provide a better experience,” CEO Tony Spring told CNBC in an interview.

Last quarter, the company said it was hiking prices of certain products to offset tariff costs. Spring said Wednesday that the company now has tariff impacts included in its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic about the future.

“Tariffs are real. It’s a component of the business, but we have tail winds that we are trying to mitigate against those headwinds,” Spring said. “That’s a better customer experience, that’s a newer assortment, that’s less redundancy in our assortment, that’s now a business that’s growing across all three nameplates in our portfolio and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.”

Spring added that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion.

Macy’s said it saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, and Spring said the retailer’s strategy is leaning into business segments that are working to keep its momentum going, including growth in denim, women’s contemporary apparel and watches.

Here’s how the company performed during its fiscal second quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 41 cents adjusted vs. 18 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $4.81 billion vs. $4.76 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, the company’s net income was $87 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $150 million, or 53 cents per share, the year prior. Net sales dropped from $4.94 billion in the year-ago period to $4.81 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 41 cents.

Macy’s said the group of 125 stores that the company has chosen to focus on with higher staffing and renovations, outperformed the broader Macy’s brand, seeing comparable sales growth of 1.1% on an owned basis.

The department store also owns Bloomingdale’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.6% on an owned basis, and Bluemercury, which saw comparable sales rise 1.2%. Those two brands have consistently performed better than the Macy’s namesake stores.

The company also reported a $28 million increase in credit card net revenue to $153 million.

“When you think about the strength of a department store or a marketplace, it’s when multiple categories are working,” Spring said Wednesday.

CFO Tom Edwards said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Macy’s is exploring more price hikes on certain products because of tariffs.

“We’re adjusting prices, but as appropriate, not broad-based and really assessing it with our partners in an effort to remain competitive,” Edwards said. “I believe that we are really well positioned to navigate through this time given our business model.”

1n7f1zl,stocks,BNPL is taking a chunk out of the credit card business with high momentum growth year over year.,"BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) payment options offered by companies such as SoFi, Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, Block, PayPal, Sezzle, Shop Pay, etc, offer interest-free purchase options split into several payments. Merchants, such as Walmart, Amazon, and many more, love BNPL because people tend to purchase more items, as well as items they don't immediately need.  In fact, they're willing to pay 3% to 8% fee for BNPL operating companies to complete the purchase, which would be substantially more than the credit card fee of 2 to 3%.  On top of the merchants' fees, BNPL has strict late fees and a high interest rate for late payments.

The BNPL market reached $340 billion globally in 2024 and continues to grow year over year. In 2024, 86.5 million Americans used BNPL services across retail categories. Shoppers spent $18.2 billion using BNPL during the 2024 holiday season alone.  BNPL Payments to Grow by 13.7% to Surpass $560 billion this Year.

1n7ejyn,stocks,Markets are at record highs. Which growth stocks still have room in H2 2025? Here are 5 with surprising data,"The S&P and Nasdaq are sitting near record highs…but not every growth stock has run as hard as the mega-caps. Some names are showing double digit sales growth and EPS momentum while still trading below their 2021 peak valuations…

Here are a few that stood out to me (data from Finviz / company filings):

APP (Applovin): +36% YTD; EPS +102% this year; sales growth +34% YoY; forward P/E ~32.8

DASH (DoorDash): +47% YTD; EPS up ~750%; revenue +23.8% YoY; forward P/E ~63

CVNA (Carvana): +76% YTD; EPS growth +170%; sales +39.5% YoY; forward P/E ~117

NET (Cloudflare): +82% YTD; +138% 1-year return; forward P/E ~176.7

PINS (Pinterest): EPS +41%; profit margin ~49%; sales +17% YoY; forward P/E ~16.6

These are all strong movers, but the valuations range wildly…Some look like they still have room to run, while others may already be stretched…

Which of these growth names do you think can still outperform in H2?

Do high forward P/Es make them too risky at these levels, or are fundamentals strong enough to justify it?

1n7bhcq,stocks,Auto Parts Retailers:  Teflon-like Stocks?,"How about stocks like O'Reilly (ORLY) and Autozone (AZO)?   Like some other retailers with low or no dividends they trade at very high PE multiples.  Their share prices have been bullet-proof, no doubt bolstered by the increasing average age of cars in the US.   But, take ORLY for example at a PE of 37 and market cap of $88 billion (bigger than either Ford or GM or Cummins).

Net income 2021 - 2024 up from $2.16 to $2.39 billion (only 10% increase).  CPI inflation is more than that (18.5% since Dec-2021).   This even when their store count is up by over 10% over the same period.  They are not growing like a tech company despite their 37 PE.

Long term debt up from $3.8  -  $5.5 billion (50% increase).

Their earnings per share have increased, as they buy back shares rather then pay dividends.  Though it seems like much of those purchases are funded by added debt.   That has worked out for them as their share price has gone from \~$50 then  to >$100 today, but I wonder if share buybacks at $100 will look so wise in the future.

Insider transactions seem to be tilted to selling ($9 million recently by a senior VP).

Articles talk about them having a moat.  Maybe, but I think it is about as wide the frontage road between them and the neighboring Autozone, Advance Auto Parts, or NAPA store.

1nwoxpu,wallstreetbets,$PFE | A Value Play (PAPP),"This week, our dear leaders crowned **Pfizer ($PFE)** as the *Premier American Pharma Plug* (shout out to the wife). PFE gets a **3-year tariff exemption** on imports + sweetheart positioning as America’s de facto Pharma king. This is a play about value, momentum and cohesion. A trifecta of sorts.

#  The Catalyst 

* **Trump/PFE Deal**
   * Pfizer headline’s daddy’s new website - Trump Rx
   * Tariff exemption (3 years) = saves $$ on international production.
   * “America First Pharma” optics → expect contracts, political cover, insider trading, regulatory hall passes, and subsidies.
   * Collusion Forecast = 100%
* **Obesity Drugs (MET-097i)**
   * Pfizer bought METSERA (9/22). It's a weight loss drug - we love them around here. 
      * Very positive trial results: \~14% weight loss in 28 weeks.
      * Phase three trials slated to wrap Q4 '25, and I'm sure they'll fast track this to market.
      * Regards will be yoloing $PFE in no time. 
   * FDA approval is guaranteed.

# V.2's Discount Bin

Here’s where it gets stupid (and I'm eyeing all three):

* **Pfizer (PFE)**: Forward P/E \~**9.6×**
* **Merck (MRK)**: \~**9.7×**
* **Bristol-Myers (BMY)**: \~**7.2×**

For context:

* The **XLV Healthcare ETF** trades at **21×** forward earnings.
* The **S&P 500** sits at **34.7×**.

So Big Pharma = **half off vs other healthcare names**, and literally **⅓ the cost of the S&P 500**.

  Translation: Market paying $35 for every $1 of S&P earnings. Healthcare ETF = **$21**. Big Pharma: **$7-9**. Still cranking profits, but priced like they’re dying. All the while you regards keep yoloing Nona's inheritance on memes, Elon & pipe dreams.

*""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men""\~ SLJ*

#  Financials

* **Revenue**: $100B peak (2022, COVID boom) → $63.6B (2024). Post-COVID drop, but stabilization already showing.
* **Margins**: Net income crushed in 2023 ($2B) → back up to $8B+ in 2024. Tariff breaks + obesity pipeline = more margin tailwinds.
* **Trump Rx/Discount Drugs**: Only for Medicaid which is only \~2% of Pfizer revenue (non-factor, we go moon)
   * **2025:**
   * **Reaffirmed full-year Revenue guidance at $61-64B**

* **ROE**: \~18% TTM — still strong.
   * RSI \~37 → not oversold, room to bounce (trust me, bro)
   * MACD neutral (it’s swung between +/- .01 for 24hrs). Tiny bit more umphhhhh
* ADX \~13–14 → weak trend 
* **History check (Stable AF)**:
   * **2008 Crisis** → Revenue flat (\~$48B) while banks burned. Net income still $8B+.
   * **COVID hangover** → revenues fell, but company still profitable and paying dividends.
   * Bears - remember this when the market collapses, I found a blanket for you \^
* Lesson: **Pharma doesn’t die in downturns**. It absorbs pain and keeps cash flowing. \*Are you paying attention, behrs?\*

**Technicals:** \[Big words & shit below - regards skip to the ""Bullish"" part\]

* **Support Levels**: $23.80 (major), $21.59 (deeper fallback).
* **Resistance Levels**: 
   * 24.88 (near-term ceiling) 
   * $26.31 (stronger barrier) <====\[**We Are Here\]** ====>**$29.22 (breakout target).**
* **Moving Averages**: 50 / 100 / 200 SMA clustered around $24.2–$24.9 → ***We broke this, it's ready***.

If $PFE holds the \~$24 support and clears \~$26 with volume **\[YES, WE'RE HERE\]**, it’s set up for the run toward $29+.

***Volume was at \~70MM at close today /// Daily Ave-***  *46.8MM* ***.*** (1/16 $30C had 150k+ OI today).

* **Bears**: You want stability in chaos. $PFE is your bunker. It’ll ride out America’s very own Tiananmen Square and still send you divy’s for your support.
* **For Bulls**: Momentum + tariff win + obesity drug hype + bargain-bin valuation. Premiums are cheap, IV is low. 

# My Sentiment

* Some Americans still blame Pharma (PFE & MRNA in particular) for masks, COVID, autism, the rapture and their McD's gut.
* But Trump just gave Pfizer the golden hall pass: tariff-free, state-backed, obesity-fighting miracle pills + discount meds.
* Expect 75% of the public to “forget” Pfizer's ""sins"" in 5 days flat -- ***same way they forgot Epstein***... (the other 25% can't afford it anyways)
* The stock is undervalued. It's gaining momentum and it broke through the strongest band of resistance.
* Premiums are dirt cheap, IV is low, & daily volume is still well above daily average.
* I like the stock. I like the value. I like the setup. 

**I'm Bullish and I'm holding.**

**$33-36 target /// $40** if obesity hype + tariff savings + meddling + momentum align.

Expiry: 12/19, 1/16, 6/18

Strike: **$30C/ $32.5C/$35C**

TLDR:

Pfizer trades at **⅓ the valuation of the S&P**, while still being profitable, recession-proof, and now tariff-protected. Add in obesity drug hype + political favoritism, and this is Big Pharma at clearance-sale prices. Target $33–36 Q1/Q2 ’26.

1nwn1oz,wallstreetbets,GLXY 35.5P for 10/10/2025 - 40k contracts sold - Basically Free Money,"Whale order for selling 40k contracts spotted. There was a similar whale that did a bull put spread last week selling 31.5P and buying 29.5P and then closed out and switched to a bear put spread mid week buying 35P and selling 33.5P. 

Last week I sold five 31P contracts for 9/29/2025 and closed mid week.

I am actively trying to gain exposure to this name. To make it crystal clear, for some regards, SELLING PUTS = BULLISH. The whale will MAKE MONEY if the price of GLXY ends higher than 35 on 10/10/2025 (assuming he keeps his position). I assume most people in this group are long. If the price falls below 35 next week and whale keeps his position open, he will defend the 35 level as he has a massive incentive to do so. 

My Current GLXY Positions:

* Long 300 shares at 32.50
* Sold 4 contracts of 35P for 10/10/2025
* Sold 1 contract for 35P for 10/3/2025
* Debating selling another 5-8 contracts 35P contracts for 10/10/2025.

1nvs275,wallstreetbets,Apple tables Vision Pro sequel to pursue smart glasses: report,"Apple has tabled its efforts to produce a follow-up to its Vision Pro headset in favor of developing a new line of smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence, according to Bloomberg.

The Cupertino company has moved staff from working on its new, lighter and cheaper Vision Pro to focus on its smart glasses, which would be similar to those offered by Meta Platforms, the report said, citing people close to the issue. Apple engineers are working on at least two types of the smart glasses. One is being crafted to be paired with an iPhone and will lack its own display. This could be revealed as soon as 2026. The other version will contain a display similar to the recently released Meta Ray-Ban Display.

Apple's smart glasses are expected to utilize voice interaction and AI capabilities, the report said. It would also rely on an upgraded Siri, which is projected for a March release at the earliest. They would also feature a much lower price tag than the Vision Pro, which started at $3,499.

Meta released its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on Tuesday, Sept. 30. They start at $799 and feature the Meta Neural Band.

1nvpvso,wallstreetbets,$SNAP – The Only Specs That Matter 🚀,"Alright, listen up smoothbrains. While you apes are busy lighting your grandma’s retirement funds on fire buying quantum vaporware stocks with zero revenue and YOLO’ing into Opendoor like it’s the next Amazon instead of a failing real estate pawn shop, I’m looking at a stock that could 10x if this plays out. Yes, the ghost app you use to send nudes to your ex is actually a once-in-a-decade moon ticket.

[“JPow told my wife this was safe”](https://preview.redd.it/a84d6o9qglsf1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=374dc3ecc175dde106a5375911dff2da3083c33b)

Now let me explain why your mom’s boyfriend is bullish:

1. **ATH Collapse** – SNAP’s all-time high was \~$80 before Tim Apple slapped them across the face with iOS privacy changes. Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**.
2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos.
3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect.

I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps.

Now, I’ll keep it real with you:

* Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical.
* Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things.
* User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue.
* CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times.

**Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits.

1nvla89,wallstreetbets,Exited too early on a 40x trade…,"Been pretty shaken up about this for hours now…

Thought I made a great trade when I bought and sold this Eli Lilly call option yesterday for over +500% profit (turned $179 into $1,086 within the same day) 

I had to sell this contract and cash out because I needed the money to cover the amount I was short on rent (which was due today), pay some bills, and afford groceries & other necessities - Also didn’t think that exiting the position when it hit 6x was that conservative. 

Before anyone comes at me for “gambling to make a living/afford food & rent” - I actually work full-time in finance, in office 5 days a week. But anyone familiar with UK salaries will understand that a job is simply not enough, especially if you’re relatively young/entry-mid level, which I am (The average rent in London is higher than the average monthly take-home pay in this city…so yeah). 

I had bought this call when the stock price was $730 yesterday, and sold when it hit $760 (which was my strike price anyway). 

But if I had known that it was going to increase by 100 POINTS in 2 days (past $830), I would have obviously kept it. 

The figure at the top of this contract isn’t 100% accurate (the highest price I saw on the option chain was around $7,335), but even just based on this amount, I missed out on an extra $6,000 of profit. It would have alleviated so much of my financial stress; and having turned $179 into $7,075 with one  ~40x trade would have been an amazing feeling. 

Does anyone have any thoughts to share that can make me feel better? 😩",91,139,2025-10-01 21:34:32,https://i.redd.it/19vilvh4kksf1.jpeg,2025-10-03 09:03:49.068694

1nvcnke,wallstreetbets,$GAP - My Market Research,"**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH**

\---

Lots of people been asking me for my DD on gap - so here's a weeks worth of insights & market research into $GAP. I think there's potential, but we won't know the result until ER's.

Traditional metrics at a glance before diving in.

**Price & Value:** It's currently trading at a P/E of \~9.5 which tends to signal ""undervalued"" or ""something is wrong"". Which one is it here? I compared to competitors -- LULU has a P/E of 12 & AEO: P/E of 16.5. We need to rule out ""something is wrong"" -- which I discuss below (is GAP dead?). It's trading at a significant discount... why?

**Stability**: GAP has a solid dividend (\~3% at the time of posting) & has been around since the 1960s. It is a very well known and recognized international brand that's not going anywhere.

**Sentiment**: Everyone I chatted with was bullish on GAP. I didn't see many real big bear arguments other than ""it's a dead brand"" and ""insiders sold 500k shares"". I commented on those below & would like to hear more views on why this is a bad investment or my thesis is wrong / will not play out.

**Team:** You can do your own research into the executive team here, I had a glance over a few people. They have a solid team who can execute & who I believe are genuinely interested in turning the company around. Current CEO ran Mattel for a long time & was heavily involved in growing barbie, hot wheels & fisher-price. He's been CEO of GAP for \~2 years and doing well via his playbook. The rest of their executive team also has an impressive history. Price hasn't really moved in the last 2 years despite good execution (imo).  [https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team](https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/about/leadership/executive-leadership-team)

**Current Average Analyst PT:** \~24.4

**Catalyst**: They just launched their most successful ad campaign ever -- I validated it was real myself. I haven't seen too many in the investing world talking about it. See the reference source below (another WSB's DD) for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did and the campaign is considered by many to be ""more successful"". They got over half a billion views in aggregate. **The ad campaign started on AUG 19th, ONLY 9 DAYS BEFORE THE LAST ER's & resulted in an 8.5% increase in foot traffic during the first week.** The rest we don't know (we can only speculate). We won't know the true results until next ER's. I looked at the google trends for bullish terms related to this campaign / ad -- see below. We won't know if this was a one off event or the start of a trend until ER's.

**Similar Events:** AEO launched a highly successful ad campaign (Sydney Sweeney has good jeans). I looked at their google trends & diffed them. The trends on this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. And the jumps seemed more pronounced on GAP.

\---

**Trends (correlated to online sales):** \~40% of gaps sales come from online, some search terms spiked by 200-400% interest. GAP order spiked by \~450%, GAP buy by \~500% & some other related terms I looked up had similar spikes. We're operating on incomplete information here -- I can't quantify how the trends map to sales (they do tend to be correlated tho). Search interest != sales

[Various terms to buy gap online spiked by 200-400&#37; - shown 5 year average](https://preview.redd.it/j3kfhe7jukrf1.png?width=2476&format=png&auto=webp&s=083a51a039a23b3b63ca54b0a43209e12b1e6b33)

\---

**Trends (correlated to in store sales):** \~60% of sales comes from in store (citation needed -- someone clarify numbers please). This jump in august (ie: before school season) doesn't typically occur. There is a periodic trend that can been seen spiking in November (what happens in nov???). I noticed this across all search terms. Search interest for ""Gap location"" spiked by a staggering 800% and ""Gap store"" spiked \~300%. The Aug / sept spike doesn't usually occur - it's a unique event (which I suspect is related to the ad campaign).

\---

Relative spike / comparable one for AEO (It also lasted a similar amount of time). For comparison purposes. For reference -- AEO is up from $11 to $17 (55% since they started their ad campaign). GAP is up... \~2% (\~$21 -> 21.7)

\---

**ER's Call:** I listened to the entire ER's call. You can find it on youtube here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpVaT0MNpA) . Transcript can be found here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings\_call-351764.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GAP/earnings/GAP-Q2-2026-earnings_call-351764.html)

**Insights**: TLDW: Focusing on growth, brand. Mentioned ad a few times -- but didn't push it or mention potential impacts much. CEO dropped some hints, but I don't think they were picked up on by many

**\~28:40** (Katrina O'Connell, CFO): ""Last quarter, we previewed an estimated net tariff impact of fiscal twenty twenty five of approximately 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 from the April trade policy. I am proud that the teams have since mitigated the majority of that impact. Reflected in our outlook today is the estimated incremental impact related to the latest trade policies effective August 7. Starting with full year 2025 net sales, **we continue to expect net sales to be up 1% to 2% year over year**. Our outlook assumes ongoing strength at Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic, and a longer recovery at Athleta.""

**\~42:40** (Richard Dickson, CEO): ""This campaign, which launched last week starring Katseye, has driven record breaking response for the brand. Early reads. This is striking range of probably being one of the most iconic brand campaigns certainly that we've done, but that is out there. People aren't just watching, but they're actively joining and **suggesting that this is actually a cultural takeover**. These are great proof points and elements that, again, the playbook is working"".

**My read / take:** They are forecasting not a huge jump in net sales & didn't push the ad super hard as the results were unknown. They mentioned their ad got 20million views in the first 3 days. I don't think people paid too much attention to it on the call, via the Q&A at the end. Search for ""eye"" in the transcript - it was only mentioned twice as far as I can tell. GAP has had a beat on the last 8 ER's. You can validate this yourself. They seem to undersell themselves on guidance / projections each time (ie: I think CEO might sandbag guidance to get beats every time). Tariffs were mentioned \~30 times on the call - I think that's the concern most analysts had (risks) & was a major discussion point (dominating the ad campaign)

\---

**Bear Arguments:**

**Insider Selling (recent 500k):** For people worried about the recent 500k share insider sale. I looked into it. As per google: ""Following the transaction, Mr. Fisher directly owns **12,835,433 shares**, indirectly holds 2,829,502 shares by trust, 132,257 by spouse and 22,015,000 by limited partnerships"", ie: **he owns \~38million shares** still. He's been a director of GAP since 1990 & he sold \~1.5% of his stake. **He's 71**, probs just want a house on the water or something. **I give him a pass.**

**GAP IS DEAD:** I asked around a bit (including talking to girls in the bar, and had 3 friends go to the store and talk to employees / view foot traffic). I don't believe this is true. Several of the girls I chatted with were into GAP (aged \~24-28) and two had even heard of the katseye ad. I asked a few investors to chat with their kids / wives / etc, and several were into GAP right now (who previously were not). I don't have a large enough sample size to say much about this -- but talking around I don't think it's true. I even went as far as had a few friends physically go to the stores and chat with employees. I got some mixed reviews on how much busier gap is, but the general consensus was ""its been getting a little busier these last few years""

**Low Trade Volume:** Welcome to buying things market hasn't noticed yet (or just be completely wrong, both are possible). Nobody was talking about GAP on the investing forums I frequent / lurk. It has very little volume, IV is super low. It's cheap via all traditional metrics as compared to competitors. I suspect people will start to look at / evaluate GAP as we get closer to the ER's. I really have no idea tho -- low volume just signifies to me that not many people are looking at it (yet) - which gives me a little more confidence in my thesis. It means I'm either early or just wrong. The catalyst outlined \*already occurred\* and I'm just trying to price in the effects of it. The general consensus I got from other investors (who hadn't looked at anything) was ""gap is dead I thought?""

**Tariffs:** As per above, tariffs were mentioned \~30 times during the last ER's. It was a major talking point, and although it is a risk, imo it's been priced in already. Literally everyone already knows about them & all the analysts considered them when coming up with their existing estimates. ie, imo, priced in.

**I need more bear arguments, please comment bear arguments or correct / highlight misinformation in my thesis. Why won't this thesis play out? I'm aware that trends != sales, I'm operating on incomplete information. If we all knew the results of this it'd be perfectly priced in already**

\---

**Some sources (WSB DD):** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking more successful. Their Youtube ads got over 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. It went viral with the younger generation. Inventory related to the campaign was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked.

**Comparison of AEO vs GAP campaign (ie: fighting for cultural relevance).** [https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025](https://www.brandvm.com/post/gap-vs-american-eagle-ads-2025)

TLDR: Looks like GAPs campaign had larger impact & even resulted in increased foot traffic during the first week.

**Another high level source / thread:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

**Realistic price targets:** Putting a P/E target of \~12 (imo it is growing after what I looked into) puts the price target up to \~27.5-28.0. They've beat their last 8 er's and market isn't rewarding them for it yet. Their executive team has been delivering ever since Richard Dickson took over as CEO. I also suspect sales may come in hotter than expected resulting in a beat, suggesting even higher targets. I don't see much more downside here, I've been averaging into more calls

\---

**Poker room:** I posted my positions to WSB's. I was doing DD / market research in the comments with some other investors. Mods silently removed it after a week without telling me. A lot of people picked up on this & asked me why it was removed. Mods didn't give me a reason -- I'll let you guys decide why they would do that

\---

1nutrag,wallstreetbets,$SNAP - Everyone loves to hate it,"$SNAP Position: 200,000 shares at $8.15

Sentiment is just awful for after missing numbers quarter after quarter. 

What I like: -Massive DAU and MAU, still growing users, albeit not in North America.

-Revenue is growing YoY, albeit at a low rate.

-Subscription revenue is at $700mm annualized now. They’re aggressively trying to grow it, most recently by requiring a subscription for Memories storage of over 5GB.

-Spiegel is out in public making a lot of speeches and seems to be fired up in turning the ship around. His recent letter to employees showed he has some renewed vigor and talked about “start-up like returns”.

-Balance sheet is ok, leverage ratios are fine. They have time to turn this ship around, there are no dangers of breaching any debt covenants. 

-Valuation is cheap and the stock has been left for dead. Market has no faith in management and it feels like the company only exists to enrich insiders. I like this because it’s priced for failure, yet a hint of a turnaround can easily make this a multi-bagger.

What I don’t like:  -Company can’t seem to turn a GAAP profit. Too many employees, too much investment into non-core such as Spectacles; a lot of fat needs to be cut. 

-Excessive stock-based comp. They are sensitive to it and recently started buying back stock. Dilution rate is decreasing.

-Gross margins at 51% are low for this type of business.

-User growth is mainly in India, where ARPU is around 7x lower than in the U.S.

What needs to happen for the stock to re-rate:

They need to start growing revenue double digits and start showing positive free cash flow every quarter going forward. 

One way to do that is by growing the subscription revenue aggressively as that gets a high multiple and is fairly steady high margin revenue. Keep coming out with must-have features that are only accessible to subscribers.

Another way is to cut a lot of employees. Too many mouths to feed, too much comp, and not enough to show for it. Layoffs are sad, but necessary, headcount keeps growing double digits while revenue doesn’t. 

Evan is a young billionaire married to a supermodel and living in California. He’s achieved everything in life, but you can see that he’s really pissed at Zuckerberg for ripping off Snap features (check out his LinkedIn profile for example).

1nulltc,wallstreetbets,Commercial Real Estate (Offic Focus) Analysis,"Analysis of Commercial Real Estate Markets  
(Working Draft)

Originated: 02/01/25 10:27 am CST

Last edit: 02/18/25 3:14 pm CST

 

Authors note: I've been holding on to this for a couple months; after getting exactly 0 job interview (and being correct on the first hypothesis), I wanted to share with y'all in hopes that you may profit.

 

Primary Hypothesis (moderate-strong confidence):

The commercial real estate market is potentially entering a more turbulent period.

Despite the strong economic recovery since 2020, the commercial real estate space has continued to struggle, particularly office space.  
  


As monetary conditions remain relatively tight, it is possible that mortgages written on properties in a low-interest rate environment may struggle to be refinanced; this may be exacerbated by workflow trends, increased vacancies, and stagnating fundamentals  
  
Secondary Hypothesis (moderate-weak confidence):  
  
The insurance industry largely prefers to reinvest premiums in fixed-income and interest bearing assets.  
As we have transitioned from a low-rate environment to a high one, I anticipate that any risks associated with low-yield instruments held on balance sheets have been properly hedged by now.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

However, with an increased cost of replacement materials due to elevated inflation/wages and increasing prevalence of natural disasters, I believe that underlying market fundamentals may have shifted; the underwriting process is becoming more challenging. In the pursuit of greater returns (and based on personal/quantitative analysis), I believe this industry may be seeking out returns in a manner that is sub-optimal.

 

Tertiary Hypothesis (weak confidence):

As banks have shied away from lending, private credit, private equity and non-banks have stepped in to fill the gap in lending. This tends to be less regulated, and may be implicated in the above referenced.  
  
\*I will probably ignore the last hypothesis for now.  
  
  


**Initial Data:**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/zya7ce5shcsf1.png?width=539&format=png&auto=webp&s=520736582f5944d516723cdf9c4fe3fe1b2106b2)

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/uc3ilg2vhcsf1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=401b3c794e24b3727feb095a4d00f30d27022011)

  
Fred Data:  


Figure 1 shows the total amount of commercial real estate (CRE) loans held by all commercial banks through Q4 2024.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)  Figure 2 shows the annual change of CRE loans through Q4 2024.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)

Comparing the two, the percentage annual change became positive in Q4 of 2012, experienced (at least two) local peaks in Q1 2015 and Q3 2022, and has been below single digits in the last two quarters (2024 Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%).

A critical component of loan origination is the Federal Funds Rate.

 Below, a table that includes the total value of these underlying loans, 3 months pre/post the calendar month in which the Federal Reserve changed the direction of interest rates:

 

 

  
  


 

||
||
|Date|Amount ($B) or rate shift|Change ($B)|% Change|
| 9/1/2015|1734.044| | |
|12/17/2015|rate increase|97.746|5.636881|
|3/1/2016|1831.790| | |
|5/1/2019|2230.241| | |
|8/1/2019|rate decrease|63.294|2.837989|
|11/1/2019|2293.535| | |
|12/1/2019|2320.046| | |
|3/3/2020|rate decrease|64.232|2.768566|
|6/1/2020|2384.278| | |
|12/1/2021|2531.718| | |
|3/17/2022|rate increase|129.685|5.122411|
|6/1/2022|2661.403| | |
|6/1/2024|2998.333| | |
|9/18/2024|rate decrease|8.457|0.282057|
|12/1/2024|3006.790| | |

 

This would seem counter-intuitive: when interest rates rise, the magnitude of change over a +/- 3 month period is greater than the magnitude of change when interest rates fall.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)

There are at least two (or more) likely explanations for this:

1.      In an economic environment where rate increases are warranted, lending activity is elevated. When interest rate decreases are warranted, lending activity is depressed.

2.      When interest rate increases are expected, origination's are increased in anticipation. When interest rate decreases are expected, originations are delayed in anticipation.

I have also analyzed this 1 month pre/post (not included): a similar pattern exists and may be included in further versions.

Market depth:  
  
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis[\[5\]](#_ftn5), the Commercial Real Estate Market was valued at $22.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Back then, banks and thrifts held the majority of the $5.9 trillion debt (50%), followed by Government-sponsored enterprises(17%), insurance companies and securitized debt (approximately 12% each).  


According to Statista, the total in 2025 is expected to be $25.79 trillion.[\[6\]](#_ftn6)  
  
According to Janus Henderson, the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market is worth approximately $1.7 trillion as of Q4 2024.

https://preview.redd.it/56lykeo0icsf1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4bf1c5fe061270bacbd55522fb4e338c48984a

**Background (CRE/Office emphasis):**

The data suggests that the United States remains in a period of economic expansion. Through Dec. 2024, the benchmark indices have gained more than 50% in two years.

However, recent GDP growth has slowed in the most recent quarter (2.3% Q4 2024 vs. 3.1% Q3 2024).[\[7\]](#_ftn7)  
  
The author of this document is restraining this document to a specific segment of the macroeconomic picture: commercial real estate.

For example, a recent article from Commercial Real Estate news states that there was 5.8 million sqft of negative absorption in the most recent quarter, with 57 million sqft for FY 2024. National vacancy for office space sits at 20.9 percent, up from last years 19.4 percent.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)

  
49 out of 93 office markets recorded negative absorption in the latest quarter.[\[9](#_ftn9)

  
The entire space has approx. 5.46 billion sqft of space. Average asking rent was $38.20/sf, up from $37.67/sf a year earlier, representing 1.4% increase in rent overall.  
  
(Author’s note: I intend to add more to this)  
  
Data:  
  
**Graph #1: CMBS Issuance Data (**generated from csv file; Source :Trepps)  


 

https://preview.redd.it/1p0c4wk7icsf1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b84d0922fb35ab1430986dd5d9a4d11ec31ade



This is a time series of CMBS issuance data, in $T(Q2 2024-Q1 2010). In a vacuum, when analyzing risk assets, one would assume an exponential slope. I am not certain that applies here.

  
A notable inflection in the data occurs between the Q3 and Q4  2019 data points ($1,595.9 Billion to $1,634.4 B, a sequential change of \~$38 B). The following points a less steep increase, starting in 202

The slope of the graph starts to accelerate for the Q2 – 2021 data point (as the economy began re-opening), and began to flatten again in Q1 – 2022. The Federal Reserve beginning to hike interest rates in March of 2022.  
  
(simplified) context: origination tends to slow in rising/elevated interest rate environments, and the term of loans for commercial real estate properties generally have a duration of 5-10 years.  
  
The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates in September of 2024, and they have fallen a full percentage point; however, inflation remains persistent, and the current signaling is no further cuts until June of 2025. Below, the head and tail of a CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) table.

The above two graphs represent delinquent loan count by type and a delinquency time series, respectively. without having a dataset to work on but briefly (Jan. 25):

‘Office’: 10.03% (only two time points have surpassed this: July 2012 and December 2024)

‘Retail’: 6.72%

‘Lodging’: 5.76%

‘Multifamily’: 1.55%

‘Industrial’: 0.44%

**Additional Individual Analysis:**

This is an extension of a series I wrote between December 2022 and March 2023. While lacking precision, I was correct in predicting the conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

I am taking a more measured approach now, but the following are personal observations that I have made as a resident of Dallas, Texas.  
  
I started noticing many “For Lease/For Sale” signs, in addition to ones that were there before I lef

This is an image of an approximate 3.5 mile route I drove. Residential zones are in gray, while yellow zones are commercial properties.[\[10\]](#_ftn10)

In total, I counted 17 different signs advertising space for rent.  
  
One of the signs that stood out most prominently for me was Engvest. I went to their website, where they advertise “over 1 million sqft of property under management”.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)  
  
Going through the total listings I manually collected a dataset (n=96 with at least one redundant entry). the listed spaces were for entire buildings, not units; large amount of rent/sale prices were listed as “negotiable”.

  
Here’s a few included as a reference:

  
  


||

|Address|Square Feet|Cost (generally per SF)|Cost (Purchase)|Notes|
|14355 Torrey Chase Blvd | Houston, TX 77014|2900||269900||
|2152 W NW Hwy Ste 122 | Dallas, TX 75220|2515|negotiable|||
|5876 E Berry St. | Fort Worth, TX 76119|12500|7000.00/month(total)||Industrial (note: says $7500 in ad)|
|5611 S Custer Rd. | McKinney, TX 75070|34300|negotiable||Note: digitally rendered photos|

|315 North Greenville Avenue | Richardson, TX 75081|25743.96|negotiable|negotiable||

  
Of note is 3876 E. Berry St., that has a listed price of $500 less per month than what was written in the body of the text, a property that only appeared to be digitally rendered, and an actual, running restaurant (it was BBQ but I forget the brand).

\*Note: I seem to remember the data being different when inputting, so a similar pattern may have occurred elsewhere

 

**Skyscrapers:**  
  
After gathering these data points, I was looking to find a firm in order to investigate further.

I found a company listed as the Texas Hedge Fund Association listed at 1700 Pacific Ave, Dallas, TX, 75201. I went in, talked to security and went to the listed suite #4100; completely vacant.  
  
I went back to the security desk at the front and asked for directions to the 14^(th) floor; that floor was vacant as well (see below).

 

In total, out of the 49 floors in this skyscraper, 20+ were vacant. Below, a snapshot of that property from LoopNet[\[12\]](#_ftn12):

https://preview.redd.it/hv3xgnojicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8d4535c545616172601bea0a27c33938612aa4

4 stars and A class building. I suspect the A class rating was obtained through renovations, so would anticipate that it gets relegated to “B” in 2026.  
  
**Texas Real Estate Investment Association Pitch:**

I decided to attend an employment/investment pitch held in Dallas, TX. The final two hours being devoted to commercial real estate; the analysis of the speaker was that we were going from a “hot” residential market to a “lukewarm” one. Commercial real estate was were the “big money” was to be made.  
  
Return on investment was projected to be 100% over a five year period, with a standard LTV said to be 70% and a typical rent increase of 10% year.

 At the end, the presenter was asked by the author about office space:

“We don’t invest in any office space, a lot of those properties are selling for $.40 to $.50 on the dollar”.  
  
The author was then talking to a broker seated nearby. Through the conversation, the broker shared that they work as a lender with various insurance companies; with customer premiums (and the lack of payouts through claims), investments were being made in commercial real estate properties. These were largely non-securitized, so they did not have to reference the SOFR benchmark.

 

**Demographic Change and Building Forecasts:**  
  
For this portion of analysis, I am planning to compare demographic changes for metropolitan areas and CRE vacancy/construction (in progress).

Briefly, on average, cap rate went up, U.S. vacancy rate went up, sale price went down, SF under construction went down, inventory went up.  
**More skyscrapers:**

The green building, from conversations with employees, had an occupancy rate of 70%. The blue building had no permanent tenants (save potentially a café), as it was being converted to apartments.

Below, one of the yellow properties:

https://preview.redd.it/ijzluxfxicsf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4270a522e6e9ea2c17b07a15e8fdfe785cc10b9d

 

Using the smaller of the two estimates: 176,xxx/592,xxx= 70.3% occupancy at best.  
  


**Where does this show up on financial statements?**

A good place to look is on balance sheets of banks that now hold real estate due to foreclosure. Loan origination and loans held for sale are also starting points, but imperfect. If this were to be of material impact, I would expect this to appear (after the fact) in credit profiles. Pre-arranged revolving credit agreements may be a fruitful starting point as well if worst case scenarios are assumed.

**Is this temporary? Are we at the end of a cycle?**

My inclination is no, and that the real impacts well be felt in the coming quarters.

**How can one potentially profit from this?**  
There are multiple ways. My starting point is trying to find regional banks most exposed, non-bank lenders that may be extending loans on properties where the fundamental and market values are different, and (hopefully) analyzing CMBS tranches in more detail to understand if the property loans that underly them are actually as sound as stated.

Sky is the limit, too much noise recently.

UiPath partners with OpenAI to integrate its advanced AI models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-5, into enterprise automation workflows. This collaboration, announced on September 30, 2025, includes a dedicated ChatGPT connector that combines OpenAI's frontier models with UiPath's orchestration tools to speed up AI agent development and deployment. It also features a new benchmark for evaluating computer-use models in agentic automation, along with support for Large Action Models (LAMs) to handle complex business processes. OpenAI models are already embedded in UiPath's Agent Builder, and the company offers official connectors for the OpenAI API in its Marketplace, allowing seamless use of LLMs for tasks like text generation and decision-making. This builds on earlier integrations, such as Azure OpenAI Service via Microsoft, but the direct partnership focuses on enterprise-grade AI enhancements.

1ntyifa,wallstreetbets,DD: why i am all in BITF,"Bitcoin Mining to Gov-Grade AI Cloud?

1. Board Appointment Signals a Pivot

On Aug 18, 2025, Bitfarms appointed Wayne Duso (ex-AWS & Dell) to its Board.

Why this matters: Duso helped scale AWS GovCloud and Dell’s $B+ businesses. His expertise is hyperscale cloud + government compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD IL5/IL6).

Speculation: Bitfarms may be lining up federal certifications for its Panther Creek (PA) site. These are must-have for handling sensitive workloads like defense AI model training.

Quick primer:

FedRAMP High → secure federal cloud for sensitive but unclassified data.

FISMA High → compliance for “severe consequence” data breaches.

DoD IL5/IL6 → Controlled Unclassified Info (IL5) and Secret (IL6) – critical for DoD AI workloads.

Add Duso’s background → very plausible Bitfarms is positioning Panther Creek for Gov/DoD AI contracts (think AWS-style premium pricing).

2. Revenue Potential – AI Cloud vs. Mining

Industry benchmarks (2025):

AI Data Centers: ~$12.5M/MW gross → ~$5–7M/MW net in PA.

Colocation: ~$1.3–1.5M/MW (TeraWulf).

CoreWeave (PA): ~$6M/MW.

Texas & NY AI Cloud: $4–6M/MW (more volatility + higher energy costs).

Panther Creek specifics:

1 GW potential → scale to 500+ MW.

Nuclear + hydro power at $0.02–0.03/kWh via PJM grid (super cheap).

80% NOI margins if certified + locked with a hyperscaler (Amazon, etc.).

At $5–7M/MW, Panther Creek could generate $2.5–3.5B/year net if 500 MW is deployed.

3. Quebec Pilot – AMD MI300X Advantage

Early 2025, Bitfarms repurposed part of its Saint-Hyacinthe (QC) site (~50 MW) for AMD MI300X racks:

Memory Edge: 192 GB HBM3 vs. H100’s 80 GB → fewer GPUs needed for large models.

Cost: $15–20K vs. $30K+ H100 → ~20–30% lower TCO.

Efficiency: 750W TDP; Quebec pilot hit 85% GPU utilization on vLLM inference.

Software: ROCm 6.0+ now supports PyTorch + Hugging Face.

If scaled at Panther Creek:

Revenue boost → $6–8M/MW (thanks to AMD’s pricing + cheap power).

Quebec tests already yield 2–3x mining margins.

4. Talent & Partners Lining Up

James Bond (yes, real name) hired as SVP of HPC on Mar 26, 2025 → likely behind the Quebec AI pilot.

T5 Data Centers provides lifecycle ops, certifications, and multi-year contracts → exactly the type of partner hyperscalers demand.

Locations = edge:

Pennsylvania: Cheap/stable nuclear, undersea fiber routes to EU/Africa, political support for data centers.

Washington: Hydro < $0.03/kWh, West Coast hub with fiber routes to Asia.

5. The Big Picture

Bitfarms is quietly building an AWS-style AI/GovCloud pivot → with nuclear-backed capacity, AMD MI300X pilots, and GovCloud talent.

If certifications + hyperscaler deal land (Amazon is the obvious candidate), Panther Creek could turn into one of the highest-margin AI data centers in North America.

Bitcoin mining may become the “side hustle”; AI cloud could be the real money printer.


TLDR:

Wayne Duso (ex-AWS GovCloud) joins Bitfarms → signaling FedRAMP/DoD ambitions.

Panther Creek (PA) could net $5–7M/MW/year, scaling to multi-B revenue.

Quebec pilot proves AMD MI300X racks = cheaper, more efficient vs. NVIDIA.

Talent + partners (James Bond, T5 Data Centers) strengthen the case.

Locations in PA + WA give Bitfarms strategic energy + fiber advantages.

Speculation but very plausible: Bitfarms is morphing from BTC miner → AI cloud Gov/DoD player.",196,80,2025-09-30 00:12:11,https://i.redd.it/vpvwexcf27sf1.jpeg,2025-10-03 09:03:50.832237

Started with around $200k in the account going into August

First play was UNH Jan 400 calls. I opened the position in mid-July, then doubled down and averaged heavy on August 1 when UNH flushed to \~240. Bagheld through Buffet pump to 320, the dump back to 290, and finally unloaded on the rip to \~342. Paper hands would’ve been obliterated, but I diamond-handed it until the pop to \~342 and cashed out those calls.  
[Screenshot 2: UNH buy and sell orders](https://imgur.com/OOg0VQs)

With fresh ammo, I went heavy into FIGMA/LIGMA when it cratered from 140 into the 50s. Snagged it around $51.9, rode it up, and dumped at $58.4.

And then the final boss: went all-in on TTD at $44.18 average.  
[Screenshot 3: Order history — UNH, FIG, TTD trades](https://imgur.com/7qf3zFv)

Now I’m just holding 40k shares of TTD, sitting at just over **$2M**.

Plan from here: looking to cash out around $55–60 on TTD. After that, might take my tendies and start scooping up some beachside condos in Mexico. Real estate can’t rug you with one bad earnings call.

Not financial advice, just the dumbest smart luck I’ve ever had. 🍻

1ntp1z6,wallstreetbets,$1.7M INTC bet for NANA,"TLDR: 

Trump will rig $INTC to go up, forcing companies to partner with them and build their foundry business, for national security and his pride.  


INTC has a trump put, if he sees the stock starting to struggle, he will manipulate it back up.  It’s embarrassing for him to buy a stock with the governments money and watch it go down, especially since he’s known as a business man.  A lot of bad press will occur.

WSJ Reports that the Trump Admin has committed to help intel “find new customers to bolster the foundry business”$TSM is at $1T vs $INTC $150b, a lot of room to runA single meaningfully 14a foundry contract by Apple, xAI, open ai, etc will send INTC up 30%+ overnight.  Why would these companies not at least baby commit to this, to appease trump and get favorable treatment in the future?The US is the most powerful country in the world, and to have that in your back pocket of a company is a scary cheat code.  US takes their national security seriously, and they will insure Intel wins.

Reasons for it to go down

Trump announces he doesn’t care about onshoring US semi manufacturing anymore and shifts policy to globalist mentality and allows free trade of semis

US sells 10% stake in INTC

Reasons for it to go up

Announcement of new investor

Announcement of big company supporting intel

1ntoip7,wallstreetbets,"CRISPR ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI","**Hello again, Donald Pump here,**

I hope you are all enjoying the major tendies of my previous 3 posts. I am back again with a new idea which could just sequence brilliant autist genes into future WSB degens for generations to come... 

**CRISPR Therapeutics ($CRSP) - Sector Tailwinds, Insider Buys & Massive SI:**

* I know what you’re going to say: “But Donald, I bought this with Cathie Wood in 2021 and now I am down 70%.” And while that may be true, it’s never too late to make it all back in one trade.

**Regulatory and Political Tide Turning**

* QURE’s new gene therapy essentially cured Huntington’s disease. This is a rising tide lifts all boats moment for gene therapy, and CRSP is the OG.
* The government is already all over this – RFK has supported fast tracking experimental gene therapies, and just this month the FDA published additional guidance on how to navigate this process. There’s now more focus and more eyeballs on this space than ever.
   * **From Reuters**:  [US Health Secretary Kennedy looks to fast-tracking approvals for rare disease drugs](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-looks-fast-tracking-approvals-rare-disease-drugs-2025-06-05/)
   * **From Politico:** ""The FDA Published a series of gene-therapy draft guidance on expedited development and review, methods to capture product safety and efficacy data after approval and innovative clinical trial design for the therapies in small populations.""

**Insider Buys**

* There are rarely insider buys at this company. Look at this chart. The last time insiders bought was the stone cold bottom of the taper tantrum in 2018.
   * In July, Simeon George bought $50mm of stock through his fund, SR One. He has been on the board since 2015 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
   * Another board member, Douglas Treco bought $1mm in August. He has been on the board since 2020 and we have not seen anything like this from him before.
* When insiders who have been with the company for years start buying millions of dollars in the open market, it’s time to pay attention. 

**Fortress Balance Sheet**

* The company has $1.7B in cash and hardly any debt. This is enough to fund operations for years.

**Shrt Interest**

* Last but not least, shrt interest is **30%**! This is about as high as It’s ever been. CRSP is not going to run out of money and it now has a narrative tailwind.
* Q4 is news-heavy for biotech's ahead of the JPM conference in January. For CRSP specifically, keep an eye out for a November heart conference update on its one-shot cholesterol program, faster rollout stats for its sickle-cell gene-editing treatment, and any tidbits on its cancer cell therapy pipeline.

**TLDR:** There is more excitement in the gene therapy space than there has been in years. Insiders are buying, the company has a lot of cash, and shrt interest is just way too high.

**Disclosure:** I am not a biotech analyst, I am just a retard with a Bloomberg terminal. NFA DYOR.

**Position:** JAN 80s

1ntofvm,wallstreetbets,JBS N.V. DD,"JBS: An Investment Thesis
The Bull Case (Pros)
The U.S. beef industry is a  case study in supply-side economics. The fundamental bull case for JBS is not about today's price, currently $14.65 at writing, but about the multi-year tailwinds that are set to drive profitability. Analysis shows that JBS is a long-term play.

1. Low herd count : A Long-Term Tailwind
The single most powerful catalyst is the U.S. cattle herd, which has shrunk to its lowest since the 1950s. This is a structural issue that will take years to resolve. While a tight supply of livestock is a headwind for JBS in the short term, it is a massive long-term benefit. The futures market for live cattle is already pricing this in, with contracts for April 2026 and beyond trading at a premium. This indicates the market believes we are in a seller's market and beef prices will persist, allowing JBS to command higher prices.

2. Diversification and a growing global market 
JBS's strength lies in its diversified portfolio. The company's U.S. beef business may be facing headwinds, but its other segments are thriving. The company's poultry (Pilgrim's Pride) and pork businesses in the U.S. and its international operations in Australia and Brazil are consistently delivering strong profits. 
This diversification acts as a crucial hedge against the volatility of the U.S. beef market, allowing the company to remain profitable even when its largest segment is facing negative margins. The company's ability to maintain profitability in a challenging environment is a testament to the resilience of its business model.


3. Strategic Investments and Growth Catalysts
JBS N.V. is not sitting back idly; it's actively investing in its future. The company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize its U.S. facilities, which will increase capacity and efficiency. The company is also making strategic acquisitions, such as its new plant in Iowa, to expand into higher-margin, value-added products like ready-to-eat bacon. The company's new dual listing on the NYSE under the ticker JBS is a major catalyst that will attract more institutional investors and increase the stock's liquidity and visibility.

4. Noticeable spike dates: 8/29, 9/2, 9/3
Current short position is 24 million shares representing 7% of the outstanding float. This represents a 24% increase from the prior month. 

The Bear Case (Cons)
While the long-term outlook for JBS is strong, investors must also be aware of the significant short-term risks and headwinds. The bearish case for JBS is not a bet against the long-term cycle, but a bet on the timing and the potential for new threats to emerge.

1. Narrow profit margin is real 
JBS's profitability is a major short-term concern. The company's North American beef division reported a negative EBITDA, a direct result of the high cost of livestock. While the company's other segments are profitable, the negative margins in its largest business segment are a significant headwind that could impact future earnings and dampen investor enthusiasm.

2. Regulatory and political uncertainty 
The U.S. beef industry is an oligopoly, and this market concentration has attracted the attention of regulators and politicians. The company faces the risk of antitrust lawsuits and new regulations that could impact its business model and profitability. While these risks are difficult to quantify, they are a significant factor in the company's valuation. The company also faces political risks from a potential U.S. tariff on Brazilian beef, which could affect its global supply chain.

3. The Risk of a slow recovery 
The bullish thesis on JBS is based on the idea that the U.S. cattle herd will begin rebuilding in late 2027. However, this timeline is not guaranteed. A sustained drought or other macroeconomic factors could delay the recovery, which would prolong the company's profitability struggles and erode the time value of a long-term call option.

4. The business model not without flaws
JBS's core business model is a low-margin, high-volume operation. The company is highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, and it has to pay for a massive supply chain, a significant cost. The company's focus on diversifying into new business segments is a sign that it is aware of these risks, pivoting to a higher-margin business is not guaranteed to be successful.

5. The Options market pricing 
An astute options trader would recognize that even though JBS's options were a good value when bought and better value now based on historical volatility and implied volatility. 
they are now trading at a premium. The market is now pricing in the very catalysts investors have been waiting for. A buyer of options at this point is paying a higher premium for the same potential reward. 
Peer  comparison  and conclusion
Peer Comparison: JBS vs the ""Big Four""
To truly understand JBS's valuation and strategic position, it is essential to compare it to its peers.
 * Tyson Foods (TSN): Tyson is JBS's direct competitor. both companies are facing headwinds in their beef segments, Tyson's greater vertical integration in its poultry business and its stronger brand recognition in prepared foods give it a slight advantage. However, JBS's global scale and direct exposure to the Brazilian and Australian beef markets make it a more direct play on the global beef cycle.
   * Stock Price: ~ $54.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 24x
 * JBS (JBS):
   * Stock Price: ~ $15.50
   * P/E Ratio: ~ 7.5x to 15x
The earnings multiplier (P/E ratio) shows that JBS is currently trading at a significant discount to its main publicly traded competitor, Tyson Foods. This suggests that the market is valuing JBS's stock at a lower multiple of its earnings, which could be an opportunity for a long-term investor who believes in the company's ability to return to higher profitability.
 * Cargill & National Beef: Two companies are privately held, which means their financial performance is not publicly disclosed. However, their presence is critical to understanding the oligopoly structure of the U.S. beef industry. The fact that the ""Big Four"" control 85% of the market is a key factor in JBS's long-term profitability.

Conclusion
The debate between the bull and bear case is a classic one. The optimal strategy is to synthesize both views and create a forward-looking plan that maximizes potential while mitigating risk. A recommended way forward is to:
Monitor the key catalyst 
A successful trade is based on a clear thesis and well-defined catalysts. The most important catalysts to monitor are:
 * The Cattle Herd: The USDA's forecasts for the US cattle herd are the most important metric to watch. A clear sign that the herd is beginning to grow would be a massive signal to the market.
 * The Global Business: Monitor the performance of JBS's other business segments. Continued profitability in poultry and pork would give confidence that the company can navigate the headwinds in its U.S. beef business.
 * Analyst Ratings: The recent ratings from JPMorgan and B of A  are pointing in the right direction. A sustained period of positive ratings and price targets would be a powerful signal that the market is finally coming around to a new way of thinking.
The Risk vs Reward
This trade is now a bet on a specific outcome, that the market will continue to re-rate JBS's stock to a valuation that is more in line with its long-term potential and peers

1nti6ab,wallstreetbets,YOLOing 50k into The $HI Acquisition Play,"Alright you fellow degenerates and gamblers, gather round. Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company. Spoiler: it *was* a casket company. Now it makes boring plastic machines for Nestle and General Mills. Yup, exciting stuff.

So why should you care? Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet.

Here’s the kicker:

* EBITDA = \~$418M
* Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA
* Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**.
* Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh.

Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday.

So we’ve got:

* Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around).
* Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot.
* A PE bidding war.
* A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay.

My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits. My guess? **70% chance this goes through, 30% chance we’re bagholders crying into our Costco caskets**

So obivously, I YOLO'ed 50k into it. If you want exposure to *actual* smart money degeneracy instead of lotto scratchers on SPY weeklies, $HI might be the boomer rocket you never expected.

Based on my analysis target price: **$33–36**.  
Expiration date: **hopefully before our (at least mine) contracts do.**

TL;DR This company was killing it before tariff, still making a lot of things, all in the US of A. There's a bidding war and company will be acquired, I expect 7-8x EBITDA, so based on some sophisticated advanced complicated math, I think stocks will be at least $33 once it's announced or goes through.

Tldr snap has begun and likely will continue to print.

I will be trading in and out for the next 6 months.





Adding dd here for context (dyor not financial advice etc etc)


Here's the thesis in short:

1. Snap went public at a 23 billion dollar valuation and had 404 million in revenue, now they are at a 14 billion dollar valuation and have 5.3 billion in revenue. 

2. They have a billion monthly active users, more than 12% of the world population.

3. They are making a push to permanent net profit, they launched a subscription model in 2022 (called Snapchat+), it's now at 700 million in revenue and grew 60% y/y in q1 2025 to 15 million users. Highly expect this to continue to grow at a tier 1 rate. (3 days ago they announced if you have more than 5gb of storage you'll pay $1.99 a month or can subscribe to snapchat+ for 3.99 a month, this should move the numbers too in a very strong way)

4. Evan wrote a letter to employees and shareholders a little while back, (I'm paraphrasing here) highlighting how he's not happy where the company is at, their competitors are all valued at 5x-100x them, and if they execute properly there could be startup like returns on their publicly traded stock

5. Their stock dropped at last earnings due to a technical one time error in their ad pricing software, this has been corrected and hasn't been priced into the stock. Stock is trading at a valuation that implies doom.


Oh and a Saudi prince buying up the company. (Now owns 2.5%)

1nt6f2o,wallstreetbets,I am shorting UNH - Very High Quality DD,"I put a lot of work into this. Even if I am wrong in the future, I think this is a really high-quality analysis (DD), so I hope you regards spend some time reading it.

TLDR at the end - I wrote everything myself and did not use ChatGPT (except for the TLDR part)

 

Alright regards, this is me going against the entire reddit world as you’ve probably seen everyone on reddit going long on UNH (including myself earlier this year where I made some really good profits on both stocks and options). I closed all my UNH positions this week.

 

And before I get into my short thesis, I’d like to get into why I bought this company in the first place. Because I am not shorting this stock because it is a bad company (To the contrary, UNH actually has a very smart business model and is a big moat business). **I am shorting because** I believe the market isn’t seeing several structural risks that could break the fundamentals in 2026.

 

**Why I went long earlier this year**:

I’ll admit, I didn’t really do a “proper” DD on this stock when I bought. I listened to the “Business Breakdown” podcast on Spotify where a UK fund manager explained why UNH is more than just a managed care company.

A few points she said that made me buy:

\- It’s a health data company with all the information in the world – kinda like the Google of healthcare (huge moat for UNH in terms of pricing & cost savings)

\- Health insurance isn’t long term (such as life insurance), so they can re-price their books in \~1+ years if they made a mistake (they have room to make mistake & fix quickly)

\- Health insurance can only earn up to \~15% from government rules (operating margin goes much lower than that as the 15% is the most), but Optum health expands their margin from Value based care: doctors get paid a fee to keep patients healthy, if patient cost is less than fees, they keep all the remaining as profit.

Value based care offers high quality service and can help patients prevent being hospitalized. This reduces insurance cost (patients who get hospitalized tend to cost significantly more vs preventative care)

\- The vertical integration between health care financer and healthcare provider is a gigantic moat & this idea just sounded smart af.

This sounded very much like a buffet-style business at the time, so I just had to look at valuations.

At the time, I did a quick valuation using the 5-year historic Operating Cashflow & CapEx growth rates to project a 5-year DCF. I did a bear, base, bull case FCF exit multiples of 10x, 15x, 20x (pretty modest). With a WACC of 7.35%, my target prices were $236 (bear), $337 (base), and $438 (bull).



[my old quick valuation model](https://preview.redd.it/4j5fk8r3j0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=64aa949cc8b098eb2002400cb317b9d671cfccbb)

**Bear thesis**:

If you looked at my valuation DCF above, you’d know that I made a good profit on UNH. The UNH market price has even climbed higher than my base-case target price of $337.

But here is the issue with my DCF, I assumed everything will carry on as it did in the past and the company will continue to grow in the same rate of growth. I also assumed the market will not further compress the multiples which are key to the valuation. And that is the core of my bear thesis:

***UNH has fundamental cracks on Optum, and they will have a very difficult time in 2026 + I think UNH is & has tried to hide it.***

The very fact that the market is going towards my earlier DCF makes me believe the market isn’t pricing in this risk. In fact, the market expanded UNH’s multiple from the Berkshire news (which I will get into later).

 

**What makes the stock price go up?**

From my bull thesis above, you could probably figure out Optum health is where the money is at – and this is what moves the needle (what ultimately makes the stock go up).

But how does this reflect on fundamentals? Let me briefly summarize what UNH is:

**UnitedHealth - What is it - It’s a 2-part business (numbers mostly from 2024 10k, screenshot of my excel attached below)**

 

**1. United Healthcare (\~40% of Revenue) – Insurance provider**

**- Employer & Individual (\~25% of healthcare revenue):** For corporations who pays for health insurance. The employer either pay a monthly premium (UNH takes the risk of claims cost) or employers pays a fixed fee for UNH to administer the health service search (UNH bears no risk).

**- Medicare & Retirement (\~50% of healthcare revenue):** For old people above age 65. Government pays a fixed fee per patient every month.

**- Community & State (\~24% of healthcare revenue):** For Medicaid, aka poor people, the state/community pays a fixed fee per month.

 

**2. Optum (\~60% of Revenue) – Healthcare provider**

**- Optum Health (\~40% of revenue):** Provides the patient care & financial services.

**- Optum Insight (\~10% of revenue):** The data & analytics business.

**-  Optum RX (\~50% of revenue):** Pharmacy care services.



[\(These numbers are from 10k from 2024 and 2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/abxrwblaj0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b0506af50e58b8169fd29b526b930446803a12)



 

In short: The 2 biggest parts of UNH’s revenue are Medicare Advantage and Optum Health.

Medicare certainly moves the needle as it’s a big reason why the stock sold off this year. This is due to elevated medical claim amount /or increasing medical loss ratio for UNH - basically, old people are catching up on their knee-replacement surgeries after the COVID lockdown + playing too much pickleball.

But for UNH, Optum Health plays an even larger role (also Medicare is the largest component of Optum Health so they add up). Not just because it brings in the most amount of revenue, but because it’s the actual growth engine for the company. If you look at UNH a decade ago, United Health (the insurance wing) was 90% of the business and Optum was only 10%. Now the roles have reversed, UNH is more Optum than insurance. As we’ve mentioned earlier, Optum helps UNH expand their margins through value-based care.

**Look at the period from 2020 – 2024**:

Optum revenue annual growth: \~13.16% vs \~8% for healthcare (it’s really \~4% if you net out eliminations)

Optum Operating Margin: \~8% vs \~5.5% for healthcare

Optum Operating income growth: \~11%+ vs \~4.75% for healthcare (yeah it grows more than double the rate of healthcare)

UNH Stock price: More than doubled in the same period. (if you count trough to peak prices: $230.1 to $630.73 that’s a 174% gain)

This isn’t the kind of stock price growth you would expect from a mature stage health insurance company growing in the single digits. This is your typical growth company with a growing topline + margin expansion (aka Optum)

 

**What did the market price in already?**

Yes. the stock price had dropped from the peak of around $600 to the mid $200s and has since rebounded to the mid $300s. It is still “cheap” when compared to previous highs. It is obvious that the market has absorbed some bad outlooks for the company. But is it really cheap?

I’ve listed out a few main things the market has priced in (up until the most recent Q2):

Optum long-term margin:

\- Earnings were $6.6 billion below management expectation in q2

\- Operating margin for the full year is guided to be 1%.

\- Management further revised down the long-term margin outlook for Optum to be 6% - 8% (from 8 - 10%).

Medical cost surge:

\- Total unexpected medical cost impact of $6.5 billion (this is a short-tail risk as they can reprice this next year)

\- Medicare advantage cost trend is more than expected (utilization of 7.5% vs 5% previously): I mean, this doesn’t add up here. Management’s Q2 earnings call said they’ve been cutting back on benefits, but they still see a growth in utilization? I think UNH has been easing claims approval due to societal pressure. (maybe this part hasn’t been priced in yet as the Medicare cost headwind will be a persistent issue from here).

\- Behavioural health in Medicaid: 20% cost growth (margins are f\*cked here as margin compression is baked into guidance in q2)

Change Healthcare

\- They suffered from a cyber-attack in early 2024 and Optum Insight is still trying to recover from this.

V28 risk model adjustment

\- I will get into the details of V28 below: Currently management said there will be $11 billion headwind over 3 years, and we have $4 billion more to go for 2026.

\- Management said they will get rid of unprofitable clients + increase price + cut cost to offset half of the $4 billion headwind in 2026. (I doubt this and will get into it below)

 

Smart Money (Berkshire Hathaway)

\-  Its kinda hard not to hit the buy button when you see the GOAT of value investing put his own money in this company.

\- My only commentary for this is: 1) Berkshire didn’t put a lot of money in it. 2) they bought before q2 earnings came out (as we are seeing more structural breakdown in q2).

 

**So, what isn’t priced in?**

**1. V28 risk model Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) Risk Adjustment Model (there is more to it…)**

Basically, this risk model is how Optum’s value-based care business gets paid.

For example, a normal patient is $1000 a month. But if this patient has a heart condition, then this HCC risk model gives him a coefficient of maybe 1.5. All of a sudden, this patient will get 1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 a month.

Before V28, UNH has been able to kind of skirt this system by aggressively diagnosing and applying elevated coefficients to get paid more.

For evidence, let’s look at DaVita Medical Group, which UnitedHealth’s Optum acquired in 2019. On a 5-year trend analysis, the risk coding jumped from 1.01x pre-acquisition to 1.5x post-acquisition. If this isn’t aggressive, I don’t know what is!

So, what did V28 do? In plain English, it’s stricter and UNH can no longer code aggressively (they got rid of 2000 diagnostic categories and flattened the weighting for some conditions – less room for a doctor to say: this guy has diabetes, and I think it’s severe, let’s give him a 2.0 instead of 1.5).

On top of that, UNH employs 10% of doctors in the U.S and with the pricing pressure + more utilization rate (aka. Old people visiting more often), I just don’t buy what management was saying (they can offset 50% of the V28 headwind next year by ‘cost savings’). I think Optum margins will be negative in 2026 and be lower than 5 - 7% long-term. And this is the structural risk to the fundamentals.

 

**2. Shady Accounting Treatment**

**a. Selling a part of their Optum business and using gains as operating income**

Considering UNH’s entire $5 billion of Optum’s operating earnings growth for 2024 came from this ‘gain on sales,’ this certainly isn’t a good look for UNH. And guess what, they have been doing this in both 2024 and 2025.

It also makes me wonder why? My thesis is that if you look at the V28 risk model revision headwind total of $11 billion over 3 years, it’s around $3 billion a year. So maybe they are using this as offset for this headwind. But regardless, they have been shady with accounting, and I think there is more to this.



[\(From the 2024 10k – MD&A section\)](https://preview.redd.it/o76s24pmj0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b8c60ae5d164af67a23a7afc867c8f87c653df3)



To add, they’ve decided to stop this in q2 this year, resulting in a $2 billion loss for Optum earnings. This means 2 things: 1) they’ve been doing this for over a year and a half; 2) They were gonna fill $2 billion of financials holes doing the same thing but just decided to stop.



[\(from the 2025 q2 earnings call transcript\)](https://preview.redd.it/lmty155pj0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=b119717dcf5f04ae9905f9315b8cab5b0126dfd4)

 

**b. Use intercompany transactions to inflate segment profitability**

While this isn’t 100% confirmed, certain industry contacts have indicated that Optum is selling services to the United Healthcare side for much more than the market price. They do this to inflate the profitability of Optum (this information is taken from Baird analyst Michael Ha’s interview video with Steve Eisman).

From a simple google search, I can also find similar headlines where UNH is upselling internally.

https://preview.redd.it/dxq9qhzsj0sf1.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=094790c00072850420167c9b3d311c5b7d2c6ef7

From reading the 2024 10k myself, I am also a bit confused at the “elimination” line in the income statement from MD&A (it’s basically the transaction between Optum and Healthcare, but since there is another line called “Optum Elimination,” this line is for the Healthcare segment). They only net out this amount in the consolidated revenue amount. However, if we take a look at the UnitedHealthcare revenue by business on page 29, they did not net out the ‘eliminations’ at all. This makes the story much more believable.

[\(from 2024 10k, yeah, they didn’t net out eliminations\)](https://preview.redd.it/4z7wm3wtj0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ab705b84b8bf6c6fe0973e26181292c1aa891e)

 

**Valuation + Price Target**

My new assumptions (that isn’t even too pessimistic):

Operating cashflow stays flat for 2025 & 2026 and resumes a 1% growth from 2027 to 2029.

CapEx grows at the same 5-year CAGR historical rate (assuming they need to maintain their business).

And the reason why my assumptions aren’t too pessimistic is because my 2025 FCF is $20 billion (much higher than management’s Q2 guidance of $16 billion). They also didn’t mention any plans regarding CapEx but I am being more than generous to maintain historical growth rate as they definitely will need more CapEx to maintain (given their elevated utilization rate – rumor has it that UNH has been easing the claims approval process due to public pressure. Otherwise, this story won’t add up cuz their benefits are less rich compared to national average).

 

[\(source: my shitty excel sheet\)](https://preview.redd.it/2b446jnxj0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f011c94edf8371293d1862509072e997e1cb2a8)



**Target price**: I think we can at least see the low $200s (maybe even lower) if my thesis plays out. But I’ll start to take profit once we get below $ 250 by selling some poor-man-covered-puts. I will get into details on my executions below.

 

**Shorting Strategy, Position, and Execution Plans:**

**Strategy**: Synthetic Short (kinda) with a long call to cap my loss:

 Sell 300/350 Dec 2027 Credit Call Spread + Buy 300 Jan 2028 LEAPS Put

**Position**:



https://preview.redd.it/s6n3cdk2k0sf1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb89bf42c0ac2c022eebbc74cd5be9f52ed6b10

 

Premium from Call Spread: $9,794.8 - $7,461.25 = $2,333.55

Debit for LEAPS Put: ($4,105.2)

Net Debit: ($1,771.65)

Max Loss Possible: $5,000 + $4,105.2 - $2,333.55 = $6,771.65

 

**Execution Plan**:

**Take profit**: If we drop below \~$250, I will start selling 30 DTE puts and close my call spread position to de-risk. I will fully exit my positions once we drop below $200 or my thesis has played out where Optum blows up.

**Stop loss**: I will hold till early 2027 and see if my thesis has played about/hasn’t played out/has yet to play out. I will hold up to the 45 DTE point and exit regardless.

 

**Conclusion**: I think this company is a short because the story isn’t over yet. Not because UNH a bad company, but because the structural cracks (Optum: V28 + Shady Accounting + Optum margin reset) aren’t fully priced in yet and people are already celebrating on the Berkshire bandwagon.

 

TLDR:

·      I went long earlier in 2024 after hearing the “moat” story (data, value-based care, vertical integration) but I am forming a short thesis due to the structural risk on Optum.

·      UNH doubled since 2020, driven mostly by Optum (revenue + operating earnings growth) so Optum is where the money is.

·      Market priced in: higher medical costs, Medicaid behavioral surge, Change Healthcare cyberattack, and some of V28.

·      What isn’t priced in: stricter V28 cutting risk-adjusted payments, Optum margin reset, and shady accounting (asset sales + intercompany pricing).

·      My DCF was still optimistic; structural cracks hit harder in 2026.

·      New target: low $200s, exiting below $250.

·      Strategy: synthetic short with Dec 2027 call spread + Jan 2028 LEAPS put.

·      **Conclusion:** Not shorting because UNH is bad, but because the risks ahead aren’t priced in while people are celebrating Berkshire’s buy.",811,338,2025-09-29 02:18:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nt6f2o/i_am_shorting_unh_very_high_quality_dd/,2025-10-03 09:03:50.832906

1ns8te3,wallstreetbets,Follow up on my stock market journey,"Following up on my stock journey. About 6 months ago, I posted my portfolio gains at about 1200% in a little over 6-7 months. In about another 4-5 months time frame, I got the portfolio up to $80K and now back down to $74K.

Strategy is still the same and simple, buy low sell high. Obvious right?

Well, the biggest key strategy or let’s say mindset shift when I started winning is getting desensitized to money. Build a high conviction play, stick to it, DCA if it is lower and company stays the same, and don’t get stop lossed too early.

One of my biggest wins this year was UNH. It is a high value company, got some bad news and dropped like a rock. Market tends to OVERREACT ALWAYS and on either sides too. Bad news = overreact to the downside, then price rebounds to stabilize. Same way on the upside, good news = price surge overreaction and will correct to the range. I bought the dip at around $300 kept DCA to $290 and sold at $350. (I’m back in)

I also study macro trends, and market sentiment. Right now, market is ATH, overall sentiment is bullish HOWEVER, short term wise there is a lot of fear baked into the market. So, theoretically, if traders see big red candles, the downside pressure is higher. So I will be a bear and short most of the day if market is red, looks weak and I don’t see that V shape recovery that I usually see. (Indices did this past week)

I also study the price action, I don’t care about RSIs, MACD trends, etc those are all historical indicators. Nobody will know what the price will do next. But if you really take a look at the chart in one minute frame and study how it behaves: for example AMD, a lot of the time I noticed in the morning it shoots up 2-3%, market is not too bullish, I will scale in my puts because I know that there are no bullish news on AMD and that I notice that the price fades most of the time.

There are other strategies that I use, for example having QQQ SPY up with AMD, where QQQ will drop and AMD will drop in a delayed manner (30-60 seconds after) and might take advantage of that knowledge. A lot more to this, and can explain further.

Currently I am in BMNR and UNH as my two holdings, but unsure of market October. We were supposed to drop September and I feel as if market will drop October and rally into holiday season. But I don’t know that yet, need more data thus still in my positions long.

1nrvnxd,wallstreetbets,Upcoming OKLO Catalysts That Could Push It to $200+,"**TL;DR**: The biggest near-term catalysts for Oklo ($OKLO) are (1) Regulatory licensing filings with reduced fees now in effect, and (2) LOIs converting into binding PPAs with data centers/hyperscalers. DOE programs, insider alignment with Sam Altman/OpenAI, analyst coverage, and operational milestones round out the key drivers.

Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and is not financial advice. It reflects analysis and opinions based on publicly available information, and any price targets or scenarios discussed are speculative. Investors should do their own research, consider their risk tolerance, and consult a licensed financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

⸻

**1. COL submission + reduced fees**:
The most important inflection would be Oklo submitting its Combined License (COL) or amendment under Part 52. A formal filing or acceptance letter moves the company onto a clear regulatory track toward construction/operation, reducing uncertainty and drawing institutional interest. Timing is favorable: as of Oct 1, the regulatory body lowered hourly rates for advanced reactor reviews, cutting licensing costs and making a filing even more attractive.

**2. LOIs → binding PPAs**:
Revenue visibility is the other big catalyst. Oklo already has public agreements and LOIs with data center operators (including a 12 GW framework with Switch). The next step is converting these into binding PPAs or project-level offtake contracts. If a hyperscaler or large operator signs a binding deal, it would instantly validate Oklo’s commercial model and likely re-rate the stock.

**3. DOE programs and pilot selection**:
Oklo has been selected under DOE pilot initiatives, and further DOE funding awards, pilot milestones, or fast-track inclusions would be visible de-risking events. Federal recognition both improves credibility and makes financing easier.

**4. Insider support (Sam Altman & OpenAI)**:
Filings show Sam Altman’s Hydrazine Capital still holds ~3.15M shares. Beyond that, Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, which has been clear about the massive energy requirements to scale AI compute. In a recent blog post, he said OpenAI will soon announce energy partnerships and new financing ideas. With his dual role and financial stake, Oklo is a logical partner candidate. Any announcement connecting the two would be a blockbuster catalyst.

**5. Analyst coverage shifts**:
Goldman Sachs recently initiated at $117 PT while others like Wedbush sit higher at $150+. Coverage from major desks matters because it shapes fund flows, especially if sentiment consolidates more bullish.

**6. Operational milestones**:
Incremental updates- site permits, readiness assessments, procurement contracts, or construction financing- are less flashy but reduce execution risk. Analysts track these closely, and they matter for building institutional confidence.

**7. Short-interest dynamics (secondary)**:
Borrow availability for OKLO has been tight at times, which means positive headlines can spark outsized moves. Serious investors usually don’t trade on this, but it helps explain volatility and is relevant for tactical positioning.

⸻

If Oklo successfully executes on its near-term milestones; including regulatory licensing, binding PPAs, and partnerships with entities like OpenAI- some analysts and investors suggest that a price target of **$200+** could be achievable, reflecting the company’s long-term growth potential in the nuclear energy sector.

# 1. Undervalued Relative to Market

* **Market Cap:** \~$7B, which is tiny compared to the multi-trillion U.S. housing transaction market. Even a modest share of this market justifies a higher valuation.
* **Valuation:** Price-to-sales multiples remain compressed compared to other real estate tech players. If margins improve, OPEN has serious rerating potential.
* **Operations:** Risk management has improved, inventory exposure is down, and operating losses are narrowing. They’re not circling the drain - they’re stabilizing.

# 2. AI Integration Push

* CEO Kaz Nejatian recently sent out a company wide email regarding having employees have a more AI centric approach. (Can check his last X post)

* This suggests OPEN is evolving into a **data-driven housing platform**, not just a home-flipping company.
* Early adoption and daily AI use among employees show this is more than a PR move — it’s an operational shift.

# 3. Leadership Upgrade

* Kaz Nejatian is the new CEO, and this is a big deal. Before OPEN, he was COO at **Shopify**, where he played a key role in scaling one of the most successful e-commerce platforms of the past decade.
* Shopify stock went up around 600%+ during his time at Shopify.
* Strong, proven leadership is often overlooked in stock pricing but can dramatically improve execution and investor confidence.

# 4. Why Now

* **Technical Setup:** Chart has broken out of consolidation, with momentum building.
* **Macro:** Housing headwinds are well known and arguably priced in. Even stabilization could trigger sentiment reversal.
* **Catalysts:** New CEO narrative, AI integration, and upcoming earnings are all potential positive triggers.

**Conclusion:**  
$OPEN looks mispriced for what it’s becoming: a leaner, AI-powered housing platform with a strong CEO who has scaled complex businesses before. With improved operations and a push into tech-driven growth, this is a value play with real upside.

**TL;DR:**

* \~$7B market cap vs. multi-trillion housing market = undervalued.
* AI integration = real operational advantage compared to other real-estate companies.
* New CEO Kaz Nejatian (ex-Shopify COO) = strong leadership.
* Long-term bullish — I’m in with \~$30k calls.

1nrar5i,wallstreetbets,Upcoming CRWV Multi Bagger,"Howdy gentlemen,

  
About 3 weeks ago I made a play on $CRWV $105 calls when it was sitting around $98 and posted here about it. That move ended up being a 10 bagger when it shot up all the way to $120.

  
I see another huge opportunity on $CRWV now. This stock is one of the backbones of the AI cloud computing play. There was just a monster dip on literally zero news, so I'm betting hard on a rebound next week. 

  
They keep racking up monster deals with big players in the AI space, and spend on cloud compute isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I foresee a run to $135+ next week.

  
Position: 500 x $CRWV $130 calls expiring Oct 3rd.

And at that point I knew there was something up with the Nebius chart that I had to do DD on. 

And then I realized the it was like when Sword Art Online came out. It was off to a good start then fell off season 2, which is why the chart declined. 

Then we see star symbols of waifs. I can't read Japanese, but I know it's cute. So stock price went up. 

Then it got replaced when demon slayer came out. the movie was great. And that's when we get serious with the TA. Tanjiro's hairline is spotted on the 1 month chart. That means it does have something to do with Demon Slayer. And because if we analyze the macro environment of the spike of Nezuko Body pillows by 80% after the Demon Slayer movie, we should also see a 80% spike in WEebius group.

Tanjiro always gets up after he gets beaten up, which is just manic character anime plot armor. Even despite a drop today, NBIUS will keep getting back up and going up because it's overpowered.

1nqd7cr,wallstreetbets,Single Cell Analyst couldn't be more wrong about INTEL and AI,"# Single Cell Analysts and Investors are fucking wrong, and NVIDIA interest in INTEL proves it

AI runs on GPUs, right? RIGHT?

The answer is it depends. And most people (including developers) don't know that, but they will know, eventually

Let's begin with memory bandwidth from now on BW

Each token generation requires accessing ALL model weights, that means for each output token you need to load the entire model so how fast you load that model in memory, for that bw was the major limitation of CPUs ultill the next gen

The current top xeon has 0.614TB/s which is a ton, and could be working on dual configuration with 6TB RAM at 1,7TB/s but Top GPUs like A100 have 2TB/s and H100 has 3TB/s, the next generation of Intel Xeon 18A is expected to have \~2TB/s. Positioning near A100.

BW tl;dr: \*\*Usually doubling bandwidth roughly doubles token generation speed  
BW deepdive:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is\_inferencing\_memory\_bandwidth\_limited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1brcnps/is_inferencing_memory_bandwidth_limited/)



Let's keep going, usually big chunk papa models cannot and will not work on a CPU period, but advances in quantization(from now on Q\_) made possible to run big papa models like gpt-oss 120b run on a CPU with a loss in accuracy near to 2%

Usually models are based on 16B and Q\_ down to 8 or 4, each time you half the number of bits, it halves the model size. For example GPT-OSS could run Q\_8 with only 60GB what makes possible to run at any modern workstation CPU RAM. You have 2 modules of 32GB DDR5? Boom you can run Q\_ big papa models

Q\_ tl;dr: CPUs can run big models on RAM now

Q\_ deepdive: [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization/)

[https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/blog\/optimizing-llms-for-performance-and-accuracy-with-post-training-quantization\/](https://preview.redd.it/xjqr7wqojcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b50372aec5d17a684cfa3882534067d4bd58844)

Let's talk about money, while a GPU is the king and surpasses the CPU in every metric possible, CPUs are crazy energy efficient and versatile, but what does it mean? It means that server providers are more prone to buy a CPU because they have a wider set of applications, and not only inference so they can have less idle time and more money back from their chips, since we discussed earlier, not everyone needs the biggest model available and token generation speed in new Xeon processors with CPU tokens per second sucks vs GPU they are not even close, but! Look at performance:

[https:\/\/www.nscale.com\/blog\/cpu-inferencing-why-not](https://preview.redd.it/8h79t8kqjcrf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f3f23a5491adf4064be81e5af3be9a53dd86c)

Oh boy, you can bet small to mid-sized businesses are going to notice this, since this graph is not suitable for large environments where inference is handled by a cluster using vLLM or other software that allows load distribution and pipeline parallelism.

And they are not only crazy efficient but Intel is positioning at the most competitive chips for LLM inference per dollar:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel\_6944p\_the\_most\_cost\_effective\_cpu\_solution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jxwk05/intel_6944p_the_most_cost_effective_cpu_solution/)

Lastly, the necessity of private LLM execution for small and mid-sized businesses is a niche that perfectly meets CPU inference.

[https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/](https://openmetal.io/resources/blog/private-ai-cpu-vs-gpu-inference/)

On top of all of this, Intel and NVIDIA reached an agreement which announcement literally says: ""For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.""  
[https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products](https://newsroom.intel.com/artificial-intelligence/intel-and-nvidia-to-jointly-develop-ai-infrastructure-and-personal-computing-products)  
So you can bet every board in a data center that works with Nvidia will have an Intel-manufactured CPU, which means that NVIDIA could be one of the first clients of the new Foundries that could be followed by other manufacturers and fabless chip designers.

tl;dr: buy intel

1nptl01,wallstreetbets,This stock is NEXT - DD,"Winter is coming… and I think this one is NEXT, positions last pic

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I’m here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow’s purchase disclosed on Sept 18–19. These are actual “P” code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5’s FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra’s Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",576,179,2025-09-25 01:10:46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,2025-10-03 09:03:52.356501

1npru94,wallstreetbets,"Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our
Simple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.","Gold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...

I think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.

So, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.

There is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.

These are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested.",0,43,2025-09-24 23:48:15,https://i.redd.it/dlg1dqxx87rf1.png,2025-10-03 09:03:52.356517

Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

•  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies—volume’s solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

•  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

•  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds—partnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

•  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume—technical setup for extension if momentum holds.

•  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact—optimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I’d say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

6 YEARSS OF PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today’s pop :( and they’re worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I’d be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I’m done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I’m going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you’re young and naive and lurking in this sub, don’t start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

Thanks regards, I learned a lot from this sub and maybe I’ll be back in a couple of years but for now, goodbye and good luck.",628,67,2025-09-24 15:46:01,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1npfnze,2025-10-03 09:03:52.356703

My [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/PxeU66W1DO) essay aged pretty well and I think this one too will also age pretty well 

Since I posted my last bullish thesis some crazy stuff happened, notably the DoD discovered that they couldn’t solely rely on SpaceX and Elmo because when he’s on his periods dude just goes  nuts 🌰

This fact alone serves as an insurance policy for Neutron’s future, ensuring it becomes instantly essential for the DoD

But if this is not enough here is a list of catalysts coming Rocket Lab way by end of year, 

Possible wins over contracts : 

- SDA (different layers) worth $500M+
- Mars Telecom Orbiter worth $700M 
- Mars Sample Return worth $4B 
- Golden Dome contracts (total project will be $175B+) 

Company catalysts : 

- Neutron on the pad 
- New Neutron commercial contracts 
- Neutron launch 
- EBITDA > 0 

Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years, couple it with the current market conditions and it gives you rocket fuel 🥁 for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years

1np10yv,wallstreetbets,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it’s overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn’t run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company’s robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)—a segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, “We process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,” underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD’s platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD’s scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth—especially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

My positions included. This is not financial advice. Invest or not, at your own risk.",51,35,2025-09-24 02:47:55,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np10yv,2025-10-03 09:03:52.356857

1nom7oj,wallstreetbets,MU - $1m ER shares yolo.,"NFA, DYOR.

\[FINAL UPDATE: Sold out for \~5% profit after 8 days\]

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit. Goodluck to all.

1nolrsv,wallstreetbets,$SNAP - Final update. Rolled all options profits into shares (20k share freeroll),"Same shit I did on my other plays. I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.

My trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.

For evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.

I only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.

1nok0rp,wallstreetbets,RedCat because I LOVE kitty 🐱,"Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

As of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. 

Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options

TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. 
Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO.

Genius Sports (GENI) – Equity Research Report

Rating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share

Company Overview
Genius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.

Industry Structure: The Duopoly
The global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.
This grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.

Catalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day
On December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius’ rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.

Media Business Growth
Genius’ Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius’ overall profitability profile.

Why Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting
• Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.
• Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.
• Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.
• Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.
• High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants’ dependenceon card networks.
Path to $40/share
GENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2–1.3B by 2027–2028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25–30% or more. That would yield ~$350–$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI’s valuation aligns with $40/share.

Exhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40

Risks
• Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.
• Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.
• Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.
• Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.
Conclusion
Genius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI’s path to $40/share as realistic within 2–3 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",26,35,2025-09-23 04:50:09,https://i.redd.it/qa3n1w0nhuqf1.jpeg,2025-10-03 09:03:53.871235

1nnr3mg,wallstreetbets,YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target,"Commodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.

Most of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.

https://preview.redd.it/fjp6nir5qqqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb2c56e12b8146accf6099bcaa23e1c941cffa6

I see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.

The other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.

MUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.

Wish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.

**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**

And that is not even a market data feed issue, the order was filled through their own service. How could they miss this data point?

1nnn5y4,wallstreetbets,SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake,"**SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake:** 

* Skywater (SKYT) is a special company. It’s a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.

**Core defense/specialty foundry (\~80% of revenue)**

* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it’s hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON), **SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.

**SKYT has two important facilities:**

* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in **drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**
* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not “trusted” before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for **drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**

**Quantum & Photonics (\~20% of revenue)**

* Donald mentioned the word “quantum” 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.
* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\*\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\*\*.  They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.

**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**

* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).
   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)
* SKYT is already in the club. They’re pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.

**Why Now?**

* “Quantum” is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.
* SKYT’s Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all. 
* At today’s market cap, you’re buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain. 

**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building ""Made in the USA"" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.

**Position:** Nov/Dec/Jan $20 Call

1nmucye,wallstreetbets,The Federal Reserve’s Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as “employed.”

Inflation at “3%” is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men’s disposable income to spend on sex work and women’s willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here’s the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI™) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it’s because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That’s a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I’ll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I’ll have my thot plot.

1nm0a5q,wallstreetbets,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won’t affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up… and I’m bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they’re winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron’s memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  ￼

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that’s a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  ￼
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) – PT $200

“Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm’s price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron’s future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.” 【Barron’s】

Barclays – PT $175

“Barclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.” 【Barron’s】

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) – PT $175

“Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.” 【Investors.com】

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) – PT $182

“Mizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron’s results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron’s increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.” 【MarketWatch】

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) – PT $185

“UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron’s price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron’s technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.” 【PriceTargets.com】

Susquehanna – PT $200

“Susquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron’s earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.” 【PriceTargets.com】

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) – PT $185

“JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron’s price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron’s HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.” 【Benzinga】

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) – PT $200

“Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm’s target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron’s November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.” 【Benzinga】

Zacks Investment Research – Avg PT $155.59 (Range $75–$200)

“Zacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks’ consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200. They highlight Micron’s strong Growth and Momentum scores, though its Value score is weaker given the higher multiples.” 【Zacks / MarketBeat】

“Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.” — Mark Murphy, CFO.  ￼

“NAND revenue was $2.2 billion … Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.” — Murphy.  ￼

“Gross margin … was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.” — CFO Murphy.  ￼
	
“Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.” — Murphy.  ￼
	
Guidance for Q4:
“We expect revenue of $10.7 billion ± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ± $0.15 per share.” — Micron management.  ￼

“With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.” — Management.  ￼

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20–30%, pushing toward $180–$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78–$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42–43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop −10–25%, retracing toward $120–$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

Of course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise. 

Good luck 🙏",227,169,2025-09-20 14:54:22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nm0a5q,2025-10-03 09:03:53.871976

1nlw4qk,wallstreetbets,Netflix to bid on $WBD,"[https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/](https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/)

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now—in an attempt to preempt potential rivals—is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons—that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",296,96,2025-09-20 11:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,2025-10-03 09:03:53.872022

1nl8km0,wallstreetbets,Duolingo DD,"Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I’ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying “wtf the language learning app?”. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you’re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but 

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%. 

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. “How is this bullish?” Well lets think, what’s Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo’s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It’s like saying in the year 2000, “why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?” fucking regards. 

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what’s most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers. 

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that “ding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of “essential apps.”

	When people talk to each other about music they ask “what's you’re spotify?” Nobody asks whats your “apple music, amazon music or youtube music”

	When your wife’s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says “netflix and chill” NOT “amazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?” the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo’s subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess. 

Wait? Chess? Wtf? 

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc…

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification. 

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we’re fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn’t ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative. 

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can’t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset. Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, which stands at 4.25 as of right now.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company’s growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity. 

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

1nl4gc6,wallstreetbets,US DOE launches Speed to Power initiative to meet rising demand,"*The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the Speed to Power initiative to accelerate large-scale generation and transmission projects that can support the country’s rising energy needs. The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today’s grid.*

*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump’s leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*

*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump’s first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*

*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions. The report warns that if firm, reliable sources are not added as older capacity retires, blackouts could rise one hundredfold by 2030.*

*The Speed to Power initiative is aligned with the administration’s executive orders on unleashing U.S. energy and boosting American leadership in AI, directing federal resources toward removing barriers and ensuring grid infrastructure keeps pace with demand. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are viewed as an important part of this broader effort, offering new firm nuclear capacity that can be deployed more quickly and flexibly than traditional large-scale plants, helping to reinforce reliability while meeting growing power needs.*",255,151,2025-09-19 14:03:22,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-doe-launches-speed-power-110343255.html,2025-10-03 09:03:55.244895
1nl4g6m,wallstreetbets,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you’ve seen my last couple posts I’ve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I’m a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I’m rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500’s worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you’re a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don’t call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD’s slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn’t have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren’t taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying “we’re undervalued” or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don’t care either way because I think they’ll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said “TTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market”. Well I’m putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green’s imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok’s walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",102,65,2025-09-19 14:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl4g6m/ttd_dd_the_tendie_desk/,2025-10-03 09:03:55.244938

1nkow7c,wallstreetbets,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 – 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B – beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call – 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney’s labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat – SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management – they noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw “nice upticks” in the AE business in Q3 – signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook – coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline) 

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They’re much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally – operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella – GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn’t say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral – similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok – just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I’m sure I probably haven’t seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP’s earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn’t find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT – the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim – which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP’s earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their “reinvigoration” efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it’s been touted as “the right way” to do an Ad in comparison to AEO’s campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs – their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that’s about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets – we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls – who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I’ve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok’s original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE’s best ads.

   * Instagram’s original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE’s main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube’s Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE’s remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations – and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a “Crop Tank Top”, which you’d have to scroll down to find – but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

Old people aren’t going away, so demand is steady. Reposting because mods removed my earlier post for 0 reason?

* They’ve missed a pile of SEC filings (Q3 2024, FY 2024 10-K, Q1 and Q2 2025). Despite this, NYSE is letting them keep trading.
* Lenders (Truist Bank and Omega) agreed to forbearance instead of forcing default. That usually means lenders think there’s value to preserve. Default was from technicality (PACS triggered “technical defaults” because of problems tied to its warrants and its compliance certificates to lenders, the warrant certificates provided to lenders were deemed “defective” or “incorrect"" most likely due to the audit progress), not because they are out of money or something.
* Stock is trading around $12 while analyst price targets are $30+. If filings get cleared, re-rate potential is big.
* Upside play is a recovery to $20–30 if they get current on filings. Minimum. **ATH was $43 in Q3 2024** before the Hindenburg short report which has not been proven right to this day. Was easily on track for $50/share+ by end of 2024, after IPO in April for $21 a share.
* Additionally, **the NYSE has also been repeatedly granting them extensions**, up until the final, November 19th 2025 deadline. This is **bullish** because the exchange would've frozen/kicked them out long ago if they were not showing reasonable progress on filing the delinquent filings.
* From their CEO in their latest investor relations release: *Based on our progress, when we become current in our SEC filings, we expect to report record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2025. We look forward to the Audit Committee completing its investigation as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth and drive value creation for all stakeholders.”*
* Their VERY SIMILAR competitor, who is slightly bigger, $ENSG, is trading at $160+ per share. This is incredibly undervalued, think of it as a very discounted version of $ENSG.

**What this boomer factory actually does**

PACS is a holding company investing in post-acute healthcare. Operations are decentralized: independent subsidiaries run the facilities day-to-day; corporate allocates capital, growth, and ops support. Current footprint: \~315 post-acute facilities across 17 states serving nearly 30k patients daily. The demand driver is demographics and acuity, not vibes.

Stock has been hammered and down since November 2024 where they were accused of fraud by a Hindenburg short report. Allegations have not been proven true to this day thus far. Company has been working with their independent auditors and possibly the government behind-the-scenes since then.

**NEW, latest updates in the past week with actual information:**

* Final NYSE extension granted for all delinquent filings, due November 19th 2025.
* Chief Financial Officer resigned (due to an investigation where he accepted high-value items from business partners), interim Chief Financial Officer appointed, Mark H. who is a co-founder and was previously the Chief Financial Officer from 2013 to Jan 1st. 2024.

It's becoming increasingly clear that they intend to file and they have been operating their business successfully during this long independent audit journey, along with implementing new safeguards and processes so that there are no issues going forward. Market seems to like this, the stock has been climbing up daily since these recent statements, after reaching it's all-time low.

It's not too late to hop on board the spaceship. Not financial advice. I don’t know you, your account size, or your pain tolerance. Read the filings, watch the calendar, check EDGAR for official filings of delinquent earnings ahead of the November 19th deadline.

The company priced its shares to raise about $908 million, reflecting strong investor appetite for cloud security as enterprises continue shifting workloads away from traditional data centers.

Founded in 2012, Netskope built its reputation in cloud security, secure access service edge (SASE), and zero trust, markets forecasted to grow rapidly as businesses adapt to hybrid work and remote-first models. The IPO positions Netskope among top public cybersecurity players like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.

The public debut is seen as both a validation of Netskope’s technology and a broader signal that investor confidence in cybersecurity remains strong despite volatility in tech IPO markets. Analysts note that Netskope will now face the challenge of balancing rapid growth with public market scrutiny.

1nkf4y4,wallstreetbets,$SNAP - Quick update. Rolled half my $7c -> $10c,"NFA, DYOR.

\---

I bought 1k leaps yesterday, upped to 3k after high level interactions with chat, and today rolled half my 7c's into 10c's. This one is incredibly undervalued imo. Some rough numbers

\---

\- 480,000,000 daily active users & \~932,000,000 monthly active users

\- 7% growth in MAU since last year

\- **over 5 billion Snaps are created every day** as of late 2024. IE: the average DAU sends off more than 10 snaps every day.

\- Many users have streaks exceeding 1000 days, users are sticky

\- The target audience is mostly teenagers. As per GPT: ""The platform is particularly popular with younger demographics, reaching about 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds""

\- Still super relevant, mostly seemed ignored / not on anyones radar (literally 5% of people on earth use it daily tho). I suspect this is because the primary users are the younger demographic -- ie: most people 30+ I know are not using it.

\- Valued \~$20 - 30 / daily active user.

\- With a streak of 1000+ days, if each \*DAILY\* user is worth 2c / day, it's undervalued on that alone. That's like a single ad. As per above each daily user sends on average 10 snaps a day. I'm sure they can figure out a way to make more than 2c from this. You can probably get \~2 targeted ads be per person per day, assuming 10 snaps. I think it's gotta be worth more than 2c

\- Valued at $10 two months ago and was trading over $12 earlier this year.

\- Price dumped due to bug in advertising platform last quarter. It made all the revenues look \*really\* bad, so everyone dumped / panicked without looking at larger picture.

\- Positive feedback from advertisers (ie: they enjoy the experience / working with snap): https://parameter.io/snap-stock-rises-3-following-tiktok-ban-delay-and-positive-advertiser-reviews/)

\- Reinvesting heavily into their own business & still growing

\- Trading at an all time low despite all the rest

\- Some more due diligence in my other post from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap\_chats\_in\_im\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap_chats_in_im_in/)

\---

Chat - why is this regarded? Why am I regarded? IMO this is easily over $10 by EOY. Change my view. DYOR

\---

Update:

To everyone saying ""SNAP IS DEAD""... you are so incredibly wrong. Snap is growing - quite quickly. It's actually (quite literally) \~20-30m DAU's from passing insta's DAU's. Users spend \~80b hours on the app per annum, vs \~100b hours on insta. To everyone saying they have never been able to make a profit & never will be able to - people said the same thing about reddit. Then they changed how ads are in the platform and it rocketed straight up. Snap has a ton of potential IMO -- they already solved the hard problems (make an app people / especially teenagers actually want to use)

1nkats2,wallstreetbets,YOLO into $UAMY monopoly,"I have never been confident enough in a stock to publish it like this, but based on the market UAMY has cornered, it's underpriced as fuck. Here's my shot at DD:

China cut off all antimony flows — first with September ’24 export controls and then a full ban to the US on Dec 3, 2024 — which choked supply to the West and prices soared. Europe has seen shipments freeze, and buyers are scrambling for non-China supply. It's important for ammo, solar glass, batteries, and IR/defense gear, and right now there is little supply for the West. 

That’s where $UAMY comes in. The only primary/significant antimony smelter in the US. It's processed in Thompson Falls, Montana, and the US is still \~80% import-reliant for antimony. Now that China’s sale to the US is gone, the domestic smelter has a US-processing monopoly. 

The kicker: antimony often rides shotgun with gold (stibnite). Perpetua’s Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho has \~148M pounds of antimony reserves and says it could cover \~35% of US demand in its early years — and DoD just threw more money at building a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain. Perpetua and UAMY are working together on metallogical testing, setting up the “gold mine byproduct to U.S. smelter” pipeline the Pentagon wants. If that matures, UAMY owns the furnace.

1nk9po1,wallstreetbets,Just hit £500k - ALL IN ON HUT 8,"**Short background on my investing journey**

Started investing June 2020 with £15k. Through pure dumb luck I’ve turned it into £500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with £300k.

Thought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.

Went all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.

**HUT 8**

**AI/HPC Pivot**

Bitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.

HUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.

HUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.

**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**

HUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.

ABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",204,100,2025-09-18 14:24:28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk9po1,2025-10-03 09:03:55.245744

1nk5cl8,wallstreetbets,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
 
Overall
 
•PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
•Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
•Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
•Scope: Product collaboration—not a foundry manufacturing deal
 
Why it matters
 
•Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA’s fastest-growing AI platforms.
 
What we don’t know yet
 
•Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
•NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
•Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
•PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
•Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).

1njyqge,wallstreetbets,Blow-off top signals by Prominent Financial Strategists,"You can clearly see that almost all calls were premature (made when the S&P was much lower than it is today), and the anticipated crash still hasn’t arrived.

Blue line → Approximate S&P 500 path.

	•	Red shaded zones → Time windows when each strategist expected the crash to unfold.

	•	X markers + labels → When they made their big calls.



You can see how almost every shaded “crash window” (Dent 2024, Burry 2023, Hussman/Grantham early 2022–24, etc.) has already passed without the predicted collapse. Spitznagel’s window (2024–26) is still ongoing, so his call is the only one not yet “invalidated.”


Bottom line: as of 2025, none have been “right” in calling both the blow-off top and the subsequent crash. The blow-off part (late-cycle mania, AI surge) looks validated. The crash has not yet happened.

**$NUVB (Nuvation Bio)** was founded in 2018 by **David T. Hung, M.D. Oncology biotech** developing next-generation **kinase inhibitors** for genetically defined cancers. In certain cancers, aberrant kinase signaling is **constitutively active (“always on”)**, driving uncontrolled cell growth (tumors).

**Leadership** (see [here](https://nuvationbio.com/board-of-directors/))

* \~**70–80% technical/scientific** (MDs/PhDs in clinical, R&D, operations) vs. **20–30% commercial/operational** (finance, BD, legal).
* top education for all the technical people, past record of leading end to end pharmaceutical development
* James Bond villain Dr Sauvage is here.

Fun fact:

* past success: David founded Medivation, they worked on a drug called **Xtandi** and was acquired by Pfizer for \~$14B (2016).
* failure: David had a setback leading **Axovant** amid Alzheimer’s trial failures
* that failure is often not mentioned and is also part of the bear argument.

**Financial state of affairs**

statements are pretty clear in that regard:

* good cash reserve (already the case before commercialization).
* conservative estimates, taking out exceptional R&D acquisition, they can hold for 2-3 years without any dilution in the radar. they historically burns \~$40–50M per quarter so that's in line with what i am seeing on nasdaq
* confirmed by David during the few conferences in september and his CFO.

**If I say biotech you scream? “Pipeline”**

Pipeline as seen on their [website](https://nuvationbio.com/pipeline/):

https://preview.redd.it/2a0ybu4k0tpf1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeda40b14157044bed2bb0b9f551277829e04754

The dream scenario: Good Safusidenib clinical results

* promising data with a strong clinical study as released during the HC conference (see data)
* q[2 earning report](https://investors.nuvationbio.com/news/news-details/2025/Nuvation-Bio-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com): “*Discussions with the FDA regarding registration-enabling trials of safusidenib are ongoing, and the Company plans to provide additional updates in the second half of 2025.*”
* during HC, David **claim** that they are in discussion with the FDA to go for a Head-to-Head trial against **vorasidenib**
   * Clear intention of showing safusidenib superiority
   * They could capture a \~6B market if doing so moving their valuation by a whole bunch.

at this time, **i'll only care about Taletrectinib** (commercial name IBTROZI) for this analysis.

**taletrectinib** (the grim reality):

* **oral ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, FDA approved since June 2025.
* [In June 20](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvation-bio-nuvb-taletrectinib-selected-104653135.html), IBTROZI (commercial name for Taletrectinib) received “Preferred Option” in updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).
* August earnings have shown a different [story](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuvb-sales-jump-1043-drug-launch): “…. driving $4.8 million in GAAP revenue, well above GAAP revenue estimates.”
* Not only that: “*According to the company, IBTROZI product revenue (GAAP) reached $1.2 million i****n just 13 U.S. business days after approval***\*, reflecting channel stocking and new patient start\*”
* \~$3.5M analyst’s revenu estimates.
* Long term data shows impressive improved PFS:
   * Patient who used IBTROZI saw better results especially when they haven't been exposed to other drugs.
   * Mild side-effects, pretty much whatever you see in all the medecines you probably have taken in your life.
* Competition:
   * [Nuvalent](https://investors.nuvalent.com/nuvalent-presents-pivotal-data-from-arros-1)’s rolling NDA (Sept 2025) approval **could** be **2026** (priority review) or later
   * When prompt about Nuvalent data, David debunked their studies: “*putting 100 robots, letting them loose on a football pitch and watching just 3 of them cross the 22 yard mark and then claiming 22 as their median.*”

**Some math** (can skip this section if lazy or go straight to conclusion)

Simple revenue model for Q3. I like to be very very conservative. I want to estimate **Q3 revenue** for IBTROZI under **worst-case** adoption, without using early launch spikes (channel stocking, free trials) and **ignoring churn** (only next quarter).

* Let **r = paid starts per U.S. business day over Q3** (**D business days**).
* If starts are uniformly distributed across Aug–Oct, average contribution within Q3 is 2 patient-months per start (way below the current 13 on purpose)
* PM = 2 \* S = 2 \* r\* D
* **Q3 revenue** is then: *R = PM/Price = 2 \* r D \* Price*\*

Using:

* Price ≈ $19.2k net/month (65% of the listed price)
* Three conservative adoption ceilings (the variable r): r = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 **paid starts per business day**.

**Conclusion**:

* in the worst-case where we avoid early launch distortions and yield a conservative Q3 revenue range of **\~$1.15M–$3.83M (gross)**.
* intentionally, below \~$3.5M analyst’s estimates.
* analysts considered the worst case scenario without considering revenue outside the US.

**The bears 🐻🌈**

the classical ones that you would see in pretty much every biotech company:

* **Commercialization risk**: management have no proven track record **launching an oncology drug at scale** in the U.S. (yes they did Medivation but it seems that success was too long ago for our lovely bear).
* Competition risk from NUVL, Pfizer etc. (imo this can be debunked as long as IBTROZI is *best in class*, granted this could change at any point in time)
* Pipeline uncertainty: unfortunately a very good argument. it is insanely hard to be approved, hence why my analysis is only on IBTROZI

in my quest for value, i am always on the lookout for additional insider activity.

**The bet**

* currently above and analyst estimates are not considering the market outside of the US (they get some juicy royalties in China).
* possible commercial distribution of IBTROZI in japan makes it attractive, in fact Sauvage current stock price is also not considering forward looking statements made by David during the HC Wainwright conference,
* in fact none of the news article even mentioned what he said.

you can check it [here](https://journey.ct.events/view/ea2e92e3-d524-423c-a68a-fe84140ac942).

David mentioned a few points of interests:

* forward looking statements like “looking forward to the Q3 earnings”.
* (random, totally bs 2cts) hearing him talk during previous earning calls he has historically been very conservative in his statements.
* Nuvalent study being bogus and not statistically accurate
* Going on a head-to-head trial

volume is somehow low (possible quick jump in price)

**fair value of this stock: 5-10$ easily**

my 6th sense when it comes to gambling my hard earned money, the competence of the management as well as the conferences makes me think that they will beat some kind of expectations.

especially as far as patient adoption is concerned and revenu estimation.

David, you know, could you go on an other buying spree like you did pre-FDA approval? that would be highly appreciated.

1njeymd,wallstreetbets,"$SNAP - Chats in, I'm in","NFA, DYOR

\---

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B 🚀)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B 🚀)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

1niqztt,wallstreetbets,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

https://preview.redd.it/x5czfktaukpf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3bffb2eb74ed2ec58f453fe0f9f3fbede42f0e

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

For Example:  
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/second-quarter-2025-earnings-supplement.pdf): Credit Loans \~$50 Billions. Total Deposits \~$780 Billion

[Citi Group](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/2025fsqtr2rslt.pdf): Credit Loans \~$110 Billion, Total Deposits \~$1.3 Trillion

[JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2025/2nd-quarter/ac6f00d5-6753-403a-94ca-87a0296fc28b.pdf): Credit Loans \~$390 Billion, Total Deposits \~$2.5 Trillion.

[American Express](https://s26.q4cdn.com/747928648/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-2025-Earnings-Tables.pdf): Credit Loans \~$133 Billion, Total Deposit \~$146 Billion (But their clientele is much lower default rate, and often do not use them for banking)

Even FDIC believes their loans are higher risk than stated: [link](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/capital-one-sues-fdic-overcharge-related-two-bank-failures-2025-09-11/)

and just today, they've adjusted their delinquency rate and charge offs. [link](https://ir-capitalone.gcs-web.com/static-files/e68bf5bc-6f01-4cff-8bfc-67aa1f087232)

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

1niobby,wallstreetbets,$MSTR: Setup for a Pop Tomorrow,"I’m eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow’s Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock’s at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing’s basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed’s slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor’s debt buys cheaper, and it’s got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year’s cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It’s heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it’s on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor’s in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it’s rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.

1nik3on,wallstreetbets,$LDI - #derisk / unleverage -- now a freeroll,"TLDR: Risk profile changed - so sold calls, picked up 50k LDI shares as a freeroll, let it ride 🚀

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

\----

\[THE NEWS BELOW WAS FALSE / SPREAD BY BEARS FOR A BEAR RAID. SEE UPDATE 2\]

Update: Bought puts at EOD to hedge share risk (not posted). CEO sold all his shares today, saw this at \~4pm today (IE: AH, markets closed). That's all the bearish confirmation I need.  I'm fully out tomorrow / potentially short / puts. Goodluck chat

1nij58k,wallstreetbets,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it’s Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok’s US assets. If you think Larry’s not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY’s content library, you’ve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers’ screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   *  PSKY’s market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney’s balance sheet.

**I’m no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER. 

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

But did I cash out and walk away like a responsible adult? Of course not. I rolled straight into a double dumpster fire YOLO:

📉 The Oracle Encore
• 50x ORCL $280 Puts exp 10/17
• Avg cost: $8.10
• Breakeven: $271.90
• Current ORCL: $299.40
• Already +$4,660 today (+11.5%) — Larry Ellison’s yacht fund is shaking

📉 Tesla Clown Car Edition
• 20x TSLA $390 Puts exp 11/21
• Avg cost: ~$30.25
• Breakeven: $360
• Current TSLA: $404.19
• Swinging between +$4k green and -$100 red like Elon’s mood swings on Twitter

Why? Because Oracle’s “AI pump” looks tired, and Tesla’s valuation is more inflated than my ego after a single green day.

If this works, I’ll be swimming in tendies and starting a llama farm. If not, I’ll be bagholding at Oracle World while Elon livestreams me sleeping in a Cybertruck.

1nhzrer,wallstreetbets,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.",287,138,2025-09-15 22:09:49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhzrer,2025-10-03 09:03:56.807658

Paperhands buys first, does his DD later via shitposting in the daily. Here's some very high level due diligence. This company did \~30b in loans last year. It did \~100b in loans in 2020. It's a legitimate company and a large refinancer. The reason for the drop wasn't a failing business, it was due to rising interest rates. They refinance homes / mortgages. In rising rates - nobody does that so business looks bad. Interest rates are cyclic -- they will eventually come back down. When they do (not just 1 cut, but looking several ahead) these guys business booms as everyone wants cheaper mortgages. This can be doubly advantageous - lower rates (people remortgage) + potentially higher margins on the loans (depends how competitive they price things / where interest rates go). I chatted with a few people who have used them and they said they enjoyed the experience / using loandepots products. They advertise themselves as low friction, very quick with competitive rates. They operate in 20 countries, have \~5000 employees & a \~2b market cap. It was trading above $30 in the low interest rate environment circa 2021.

Lots of people worried about insider selling. It's a no story. CEO's compensation is primarily in shares and they jumped massively. I don't blame him for taking profits or derisking. We don't know why he sold. People said the same thing about OPEN (I was a bear also -- because insiders sold sub $1 and they tend to know stuff) -- and look where it went. Insider ownership is \~85% on LDI.

With not much additional DD, I bought more this morning. I haven't look at the finance sheet, etc - as it tends not to matter for my investment style.

1nhanqj,wallstreetbets,"+600k this weeks, thanks GLXY","Galaxy Digital was getting crazy undervalued the last couple weeks. Tons of extremely positive news on both the crypto side of their business and data center side. Looking to roll these into 2026's when they should get a portion of their 2.7GW understudy approved by ERCOT (on top of the 800MW they already have approved/leased) and leased out to a big hyperscaler like Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta.

If the full 3.5GW is approved and leased out at the same terms as their current CoreWeave deal, Galaxy could generate ~$5.25B/year in average annual revenues at 90% EBITDA margins (market cap Friday was ~$11B (@~$30/share), subtract their $3B balance sheet and you get ~$8B in equity value attributable to their crypto and data center business).

Think a fair price in the short term is $54/share (w/no additional approvals) and then gets into the $100's of dollars / share range if they can execute on their 3.5GWs + future power/site acquisitions.

I truly believe this is only the beginning of the journey and we are still so early. Just this week the senior management of the company met with 50+ institutions and I’m expecting we catch a bid in Q4, please keep in mind Galaxy has only been listed on the NASDAQ since the middle of May.

1ngsrhb,wallstreetbets,"DCF is actually a valid methodology, and it's working (on a longer timespan)","About 6 months ago, I posted about using the discounted cash flows (DCF) approach to value SOFI.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jhdnw2/modified\_discounted\_cash\_flow\_for\_sofi\_nasdaqsofi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jhdnw2/modified_discounted_cash_flow_for_sofi_nasdaqsofi/)

The DCF had predicted a price target of USD 20 per share, and I have made a good profit from buying both the underlying asset (at an undervalued price) and call options with the USD 20 strike.

Currently, the price is USD 26.55 (which may be overvalued now).

I think that market corrections are a real force, albeit not a very strong one, in a short span of time, but over a long enough period, prices tend to converge to their fair value (SOFI took less than 6 months!). However, it is also important to be careful not to inflate your assumptions too much when constructing the model.

Another case of DCF that could potentially indicate an undervalued (and ready to bounce) opportunity is LULU, but I'll need to go back and run the entire model before I come to that conclusion. By most valuation metrics (return on equity, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, P/B), LULU looks fairly undervalued and has a runway for an upward price swing ahead, but it is hard to know when (perhaps after two more quarters).

However, feel free to share your opinions below if you have concerns about using DCF as a way to gauge price direction in medium- to long-term.",26,45,2025-09-14 14:30:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ngsrhb/dcf_is_actually_a_valid_methodology_and_its/,2025-10-03 09:03:58.389019

The mandatory prepay upon signing 200 MW of PF2 leases is a strong tell that APLD expects to execute that lease soon. **Companies don’t put short‑fuse, deal‑contingent bridge notes in place unless they believe the trigger is near. Surprise surprise they drew up this document right after the town hall. They also released another letter saying deal imminent.**

Got lucky with NVDA and SPY puts for liberation day, then on the 9th I got in midway on apple calls for about 2k.

All those reasons led to that bottom point on september 4th.

1nfgxrf,wallstreetbets,Bessent is one of us.,"Bessent replied. “You’re quoting Goldman Sachs, so—I made a good career of trading against Goldman Sachs.”

Boasting about trading against GS must mean he obliterated them, after all he brags about his HF career every chance he can, well turns out that smug Ken lost 90% of the value of it's fund. Let this sink in 90%

As a money manager, Scott Bessent's years of inconsistent performance have contributed to a nearly 90% decline in his hedge fund's assets. 

When hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, left Soros Investment Management in 2015, he was able to raise $4.5 to make his new firm, Key Square Capital, one of the biggest hedge fund launches ever.

Markets have appluded the choice of Bessent for the cabinet post, but it’s not because Key Square has been a resounding success. By all accounts, Bessent had a stellar run as the Soros CIO for years, but by the end of 2023, his hedge fund had lost almost 90 percent of its assets from the peak: Assets had fallen to $577 million after reaching a height of around $5 billions, according to news reports and regulatory disclosures. Reuters reports that Key Square’s fund lost money in  although the past two years have been big winners, as was 2024.

So the way to make $577 million is? start with $4,5 billion. Bessent is a reTard w hard T.

EDIT: The Dunning-kruger effect is well and alive, retard read article, retard gets butt hurt retard makes up shit that was not in said article. 

I said he lost 90% of the funds value, u fucking chimp, that is the AUM.

CAGR,sharpe and tracking counts for nothing when the fund actually LOST (this is a loss of capital ) all but 2 years since inception.

1nfbnu9,wallstreetbets,FLR vs SMR,"FLR has a market cap of $6.7B. Plus debt of $1.1B.  I don't have the details of exactly how their ownership of Nuscale (SMR) works, but it appears to be massive, and held largely in the form of “B Shares”. They reported the value of it end of 2Qtr at $5B. Seemingly knowledgeable sources report Fluor’s stake in SMR at \~50%, and this squares with SMR’s quarterly disclosures regarding the non-controlling interests.

On the other hand, the share counts used by say Yahoo Finance to calculate market cap of SMR are not picking up the larges volume of B shares held by FLR. Yeah I know serious analysts will look through that, but dilution of a sort is coming as the B share convert to A 1-for-1. So maybe that SMR $4.4B market cap takes into account that only buys you half the company—or maybe not. After all, JOBY has a market cap of $12B, at an analogous point in an ""approvals lead"" based valuation.

Despite recent earnings weakness, FLR is a real business, with real revenues ($16B in 2024). The engineering business was earnings positive in ’24, although all of ’25 earnings have come from marks on the SMR position. But it sure looks to me like to that if you value the position in SMR (yeah not everybody does), you are getting the legacy engineering business nearly for free.

So I believe in small modular reactors (yes I own OKLO as well), and this is why I own FLR and not SMR. What am I missing?",12,6,2025-09-12 18:59:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nfbnu9/flr_vs_smr/,2025-10-03 09:03:58.389629

It's a blue-chip stock that has been ""dormant"". Contrary to some regards here, I'm not asking you to join the train after the stock going up 150% the previous month. It's a stable stock, and in the worst-case scenario, you can just become a ""long-term investor"".

\- Safe blue-chip. You get some dividends if the stock stay stagnant.  
\- Huge potential due to AI enterprise clients.

The trials are expected to focus on demonstrating that eVTOL operations are safe, quiet and scalable—key factors in building community trust and support for adoption of this new technology.

“This is a landmark moment for our industry and our country. We have an Administration that is prioritizing the integration of eVTOL operations in U.S. cities ahead of full certification in a pragmatic way. We’ll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,” said Adam Goldstein, Archer Founder and CEO. “These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.”

I was lucky enough to be one of them.  I bought 21600 shares on 9/8 average price $7 then it dumped down to 5.90's.  The old me panic sells,I just beat my wife up a little (JK) and walked away and went to the gym.   

Next day 9/9 I was tempted to sell and eat a 20k loss, but I told myself to hold.  Then a miracle happened and the CEO news and board directors news hits in AH.  

Long story short, my position ran +103k in a day.  I sold at the close yesterday for $10.47 a share.

Booked a $72K profit for 3 days.  Im gonna buy myself something nice!

Thank you OPEN and Eric Jackson for helping alot of people out this 2025.

All cash on the sidelines and it feels amazing!

1nf1rqz,wallstreetbets,WBD - PSKY Merger Play,"Long time WBD bag holder. First bought post AT&T spin at $24 / share. Dollar cost averaged down throughout the dip, bringing average cost across 2,000 shares to $14.

Spent yesterday morning debating selling my shares and buying leaps after Zaz announced that the spin would be done by April. Low and behold, I think the IV is too high, decide I'll come back to it later.

Of course, five hours later, WSJ announces that Ellison is contemplating a bid, stock shoots up. I decide I want to increase my exposure, so I buy 50 10/17 $16 calls. This morning, I feel like I'm missing out on free money, so I decide to buy another 2,500 shares at $17.01

I strongly believe that Ellison will bid next week and that the price will be north of $24, in line with David Faber's report for the following reasons:

1. In the know media reporters like Kim Masters and Matt Belloni have been reporting for the past month that Ellison was contemplating the bid as soon as Paramount-Sky closed. They are amongst the most, if not the most, connected reporters in the space. If they're reporting, it's not BS.
2. Strategically, combining two legacy studios with sub-scale direct to consumer offerings makes complete sense. From a revenue perspective, WBD + Para is a much more compelling content offering than either on a standalone basis. Cost synergies would likely be larger than the projected $3B from the Para/Skydance deal. Feel really bad for anyone at WBD who doesn't work in a revenue generating role right now.
3. CBS likely protects WBD cable nets in carriage renegotiation, to the extent it still matters. With the loss of NBA, WBD nets were less need to have than before. NFL on CBS protects them in a combined company
4. Lack of a broadcast network makes the regulatory process less complicated as FCC does not have to approve license transfer.
5. Timing is critical and the time is now for the following reasons
   1. WBD is actively shopping the 20% stake in its Studio / Streaming business that is slated to be owned by the Global Networks business post-spin. If you want to own the whole thing, now is the time
   2. Zaz announced that the spin would be complete by April. If the spin completes, Ellison would have a lot more competition for the Studio / Streaming business (i.e. Comcast becomes a likely bidder and we all know how much Brian Roberts likes to insert himself in other deals)
   3. If at all possible, Ellison needs to get through the US regulatory process before the midterms. His dad is obviously super tight with the Orange Man. He can get this through now. Who knows what the landscape looks like in late 2026.
   4. WBD has a number of direct to consumer launches scheduled for early 2026. Getting in the door now enables Ellison to influence how / if they proceed (similar to South Park deal), minimizing the amount of unwinding he would have to do
   5. His dad's wallet got $60B fatter this week.

TL:DR - I believe the deal hype, expect a bid north of $24, and expect it will close.

Total position in WBD - 4,500 shares at average cost of $15.66 + 50 Oct 17 $16Cs at $0.94",53,51,2025-09-12 12:23:10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf1rqz,2025-10-03 09:03:58.390077

1nesqr3,wallstreetbets,"DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play","Hello fellow regards,

I am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk. 

Before we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.

* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.
* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.
* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.

This is just the start. There isn’t enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.

Now, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers – their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).

I want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:

* What BITF don’t have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.
* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).
* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.

So, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.

Now moving on to my bulll thesis:

They have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania. 

* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.
* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 – 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.
* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported.  
* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.
* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation – this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.
* It is a value play – yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.
   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)
   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)

Can BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.

Have fun

Regards,

checazzo

1negxru,wallstreetbets,LoanDepot: A Fork in the Road,"Wtf is this company and what does it do? Loandepot is a retail mortgage originator and loan servicer that uses a tech-enabled direct-to-consumer arm. Think RKT, but way smaller. This company has a lot in common with OPEN, but it hasn't run up as much. Its current valuation and story make investing in it allows for a decent risk-reward play.

**The commonalities with Opendoor**:

They were doing relatively well while interest rates were low and houses were changing hands rapidly. By 2020, LoanDepot’s sales soared, surpassing $4 billion in revenue and employing over 12,000 people

The stock has been in the shitter ever since, especially with high interest rates freezing the housing market

Company focused on survival by bringing costs down via downsizing headcount, expanding revenue sources, and building upon their Mello platform. See: “Vision 2025”

They are making pivots and have brought in changes in leadership, most notably bringing back their former founder, Anthony Hsieh, back as CEO

They’re losing less money and are on the path to profitability. In Q1 and Q2 2025, their net income loss was -71.5M and -65.9M, respectively. Compare that to Q1 and Q2 2025 at -40.7M and -25M.

With changes in macro/Fed rates, the leadership team, and changes in business plans/priorities, we might see strong upside in this company.

**A Fork in the Road**: How LoanDepot is different from Opendoor

Opendoor’s iBuyer model buys, holds, and flips homes; there is a significant risk of housing price swings, heavy capital is tied up, and there are thin margins. The company still has yet to prove that their business model in the future will work

LoanDepot has multiple revenue streams that don’t require as much capital to deploy: originating mortgages, in-house servicing, and other services (title, insurance, real estate referrals, HELOCs, yada yada)

The stock has gone up, but it’s still relatively early. Even if this stock doesn't have retail mania behind it, institutions might take a look at it because of...

**Catalysts and Game Plan**

Citron research has gone bullish on this company, giving it a $5 floor just for their SERVICING BOOK ALONE. Citron has made bad calls, but they also told everyone that RKT was also undervalued while it was trading at $11

Macro. Eventually, rates will go down. If not in September, soon. Trump will continue to pressure the Fed to lower rates, and he will screw with the BLS numbers to get it done

The company is finally pivoting from focusing on survival via Vision 2025, and now is implementing “North Star”, emphasizing better customer engagement (it already has a 70% recapture/retention rate, the highest in the industry), deeper integration of AI/automation, and being sustainably profitable.

Tech Focus: LDI rehired their original Mello platform architects to accelerate automation and AI to lower loan cycle times, lowering costs, and enhancing digital mortgages

**Bear case**

The company is still not profitable. They have to show that they can execute to prove they can turn the ship around. Luckily, they have a lot of runway with over $400 million in cash/cash equivalents, and they can also pull $1.2B as a line of credit, so the risk of dilution is low

They have strong competitors such as RKT and UWMC, who are profitable today. However, RKT’s and UWMC’s market cap is 46B and 11B, respectively, while LDI is sitting at 1.3B. Even with their recent run-up, it still has a lot of room to grow. If/when the housing market is hot again, they’ll be enough business for everyone. Investing in LDI means you believe in their turn-around story

In the short term, the September rate cut may be priced in, which would partially explain its recent run-up

**TLDR / Conclusion**

Mortgage and housing stocks have been underperforming from the high interest rate environment, but the sector stands to gain a lot with rate cuts

The stock has transitioned from trying to survive to now focusing on making sustainable profits

They have enough cash and access to credit to weather out possible headwinds and become profitable again 

LDI has a lot in common with Opendoor, but LDI’s low market cap still makes it an attractive buy, especially considering their servicing book puts them at a $5 floor

The SP has gone up significantly already, but still has a lot of room to keep going, especially in this risk-on macro environment.

1nedg0a,wallstreetbets,The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

* With Oracle's recent MONSTER quarter, Larry Ellison is now the richest man on the planet.
* He and his son David (+ their investor group) collectively own 70% of PSKY.
* They control 77.5% of voting rights. His son has 50% voting control and Larry has 22.5%.
* They have 200 million warrants at $30.50. (Supporting Image attached)

Larry is worth $400B. This company is worth $7B. It goes without saying that he could sneeze and this thing would go up. The warrant price will be hit and Larry is known for never selling. These shares are in safe hands.

**Low Float**

With such high inside ownership, this is super low float. Way lower than it seems on website that only count the Class B shares. When this moves, it will move hard. We already saw that a few weeks ago when the first wave of shorts got blown out. There’s more where that came from.

**UFC Exclusive Deal**

PSKY just signed an exclusive deal with UFC. A UFC fight is going to be held on the Whitehouse lawn this summer. This is good for both subscription growth and meme-ability, Donnyboy will surely continue to bull post this with his good friend Dana White.

**TLDR:** I'm expecting $PSKY stock to surge with news from the Ellison's by year end. Position is listed below. FYI, just won bigly on my recent $BITF post that still running, can find reference below, don't miss this train:

1nebocm,wallstreetbets,$SBET Holding til $100,"Yep.. that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I got here 🤔 Well, it’s simple. This is a proxy for Ethereum, the #2 crypto which has rebounded sharply from Liberation Day lows in April. So why hasn’t SBET followed suit? Well, they had a massive run in May when they announced the treasury strategy, peaking out at $124. Subsequently crashed back down to $10 on a misinterpretation of an SEC filing. It was seen as value and pumped back to nearly $40 😱 Then.. the dilution machine began. I can’t hate on them completely since they have taken their ETH balance from 175k in June to 837k currently, a 5-fold increase in 3 months. As ETH hovers under $4500, having recently made an ATH, I feel this window of opportunity to catch ETH before it surges and exceeds $5k is closing and now is the time to either buy ETH directly or SBET for amplified gains. Management initiated their buyback program this week with a $15M repurchase of stock and confirmed they will not proceed with any dilutive efforts as the net asset value trades below 1. I’m no expert, I’ve been very fortunate to make the right calls based on instinct, and my gut feel is that the stars are aligning for this play.

1ne8vin,wallstreetbets,"$GLXY $CRWV- A massive deal for StarGate between CoreWeave, Galaxy and a Hyperscaler - Additional New 2.7 GigaWatts of Power Unaccounted For","StarGate is here and one does not just bring on GigaWatts of power to a building without massive expertise, knowhow, land rights and government help for expediency on permitting. I have no idea on the timing of this but the tea leaves are all right in front of us.

**TL;DR:** I believe a massive new deal is brewing for Giga-Scale AI Factory capacity between CoreWeave, Galaxy, and an AI HyperScaler. New Government regulations are lightspeeding the permitting process and allowing companies to start building while air permits are being obtained. This should lead to new massive deals sooner in the near term rather than later. Even if the projects are years out. Giga-Scale powered AI Factories are here and the opportunity has never been better for companies like Galaxy. The providers (OpenAI, MSFT, Google, AWS) don't want to be landlords or data center builders and the data center builders don't want to be landlords-This is where Galaxy fits in.

First, who the hell is Galaxy and why are they important? Turns out, they are an up and coming Crypto (we have lots of space and power) to AI infrastructure play based out of Alfont, Texas.

Specifically, Helios is the is the campus where they have initial power and upcoming powered AI shells and newly closed land deals and power requests that are reportedly bringing **an additional 2.7 Gigawatts of fully functional powered AI GPU data center shells**.

To note, Oracle just closed a $300 Billion deal with OpenAI that is tied to StarGate and the quick notes on that are

* 4.5 GigaWatts of power
* Scheduled for first delivery by 2027\*
* $300 Billion contract over 5 years

Again, nobody just has GigaWatts of power on the US grid. It is rare earth mineral levels of concern right now. There is so much work and permitting on that amount of power scale that the government had to issue new executive orders to try and help expedite the process.

For Oracle they have about \~$10 Billion in cash and they are [reportedly (Bloomberg) preparing a $38 Billion debt package from various banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-04/banks-ready-38-billion-of-debt-for-data-centers-tied-to-oracle). Roughly to get 4.5 GigaWatts of power is going to cost you about $38+($32B - $60B) Billion and yield you $300 Billion over 5 years... Not bad. And it gives us a baseline of how to think about this. **\*Note this figure does not include Nvidia GPUS.** That's extra.

For Galaxy, they are already starting this process of bringing on massive new power for land acquisitions now giving them over 1500 sq acres of land in Texas with clearly the ability to add on more throughout the years even over the current amount. Literally, this is big new oil in the making right there in big ole Texas.

Here's the kicker, CoreWeave has been buying all (100%) of their announced and soon to be ready power for their initial phases I,II,III of totalled 800 MW of active compute power.

Just take a look of all the deals and power CoreWeave has committed to and it's not just partial. It's ALL OF IT.

2. **Campus, not a single deed:** Galaxy’s April 23 release describes **800 MW gross already approved at the Helios project substation** (campus-level), and (at that time) **1.7 GW** more under load study.

3. **Update on expansion pipeline:** By **Aug 15, 2025**, Galaxy says it has **2.7 GW of additional power capacity under various stages of load study**, with **potential to 3.5 GW** at full build-out; this is separate from (and **in addition to**) the 800 MW already contracted to CoreWeave. [Galaxy Digital](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Closes-1-4-Billion-Project-Financing-Facility-to-Accelerate-Helios-AI-Datacenter-Development/default.aspx)
4. **New land + 1 GW interconnect request:** In the **Q2’25 earnings call**, Galaxy said it entered a **PSA for 160 acres** and submitted a **1 GW load interconnection request** adjacent to Helios (this 1 GW is part of the broader “under study” pool). [Q4 CDN](https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Galaxy-Digital-Inc-2Q25-Earnings-Transcript.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The question becomes - Who is committing to that additional 2.7 GigaWatts of power?

And it's not just in Galaxies thoughts and ideas. They recently closed on land adjacent to Helios in 2024 of 160 acres and very recently an agreement mentioned in their Q2 earnings call alluded to another 160 acres is now a done deal. So from their Q2 we have an agreement to the now signed and recorded deed this is a very real acquisition and commitment for Galaxy. Especially, the 1 GW power interconnect request that came with the property.

https://preview.redd.it/y505m06zejof1.png?width=2305&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb8458d05d64a8369fd23786ab928b606ac02c26

Both of these deeds are from 2025 and are for the plots below in the large red square with green circles 33, 39 and I believe 37 give a total of another 160 acres. Everything that is highlighted or squared below is what Galaxy owns. The current Helios setup and committed 800 MW of active power is in the yellow square.

https://preview.redd.it/c14simu1fjof1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae1daeb6417548f90ef3474d5c99f17c95171cce

Even the neighboring plots are just a bunch of old people selling farmland. So the question becomes. Who is Galaxy building all of that active powered AI ready shells for? Again, at every turn CoreWeave has been the one to buy up the leases at a 15 year commit.

Now, if you remember there are additional tea leaves to follow here too. In the Q2 call Michael and team alluded to another extension that would be realized in Q3. We haven't heard about that as of yet. That is still a major Q3 catalyst we are all waiting for.

What we also know is that yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference call the CoreWeave team was asked a question, ""are there or do you see any more multi-billion dollar deals being done?"" How CoreWeave replied was telling, they neither confirmed nor denied but what they did say is this.

* What they are seeing now is an inflection point in demand.
* Customers are coming to them for longer contracts (extended time periods)
* And customers are requesting the very highest end GPU's which are currently the GB Ultra 300's NVL72 racks.
* **We talked to insiders and even the NBIS deal as large as it is still doesn't fix the problem - They need still need more**
* **There is an insatiable demand for AI**

To me, what this is all saying is that reasoning models are burning through GPU's. Empirically I know this to be true but the comment from CoreWeave just outright confirms this. And to that point the very next hours of yesterday during Oracle's earnings call they reported a massive 300B data center deal and need.

So right there, only hours later another major multi-billion dollar deal was being done.

And Michael alluded to that whatever the NBIS deal is that still isn't enough. But why? Reasoning models while so much better than before they are slower than hell at returning an answer. Sam Altman literally said, ""we have even way larger and better models but we don't have the capacity (GPU'S) to give them to you.""

Tracking it all, there is still an insatiable demand and obvious capacity constraints.

Again, what is Galaxy doing buying all this land and land studying 2.7 GigaWatts of additional power for? To me, that has to be some NDA'd customer that is committing to that data center scale. So, why not CoreWeave? They are already a preferred customer and have commited to 800 MW already from Galaxy.

And it gets even better.

Remember that the US power grid is so strained right now anyone gaining access to it is basically given contract. Literally, that is the Vineland NJ deal for NBIS and Microsoft. The initial deal from MSFT is you have 200 MW - 300 MW of power coming online, ""We'll take that right now."" No questions asked.

What if at some milestone i.e. permit checkmark or otherwise Galaxy says we are ready to establish Phase 4, 5, 6, 7 to commit/contract out? That I know is going to occur but the only real question I have is how fast can that unbeknownst to me milestone occur to give an official deal channel from CoreWeave with Galaxy and thus CoreWeave to Hyperscaler?

Well, if you remember, President Trump and the EPA now have an official fast track AI infrastructure plan which is to remove hurdles and obstacles to get AI powered shells up and going as fast as possible. That's net new from just a couple months ago.

The largest benefit that will shave off 18-30 months of a normal project is letting the landlord build first without have any emissions and working in parrell for the other land and water regulations that have to occur whilst trying to fast track those parts and pieces too.

**Current Understanding of New EPA Rules**

* **Executive Order is in force.** EO **14318** “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure” was signed **July 23, 2025** and published in the Federal Register **July 28, 2025**. It directs agencies to use FAST-41, NEPA categorical exclusions, and other shortcuts for large (100 MW+) AI data centers and their power infrastructure. [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/accelerating-federal-permitting-of-data-center-infrastructure/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EPA has announced rulemaking (proposed).** On **Sept 9, 2025**, EPA said it will revise the “**Begin Actual Construction**” definition under Clean Air Act NSR so **non-emitting work can start before air permits are issued**; formal rule text isn’t final yet. [US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-permitting-reform-provide-clarity-expedite-construction-essential-power?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **FAST-41 dashboard exists but no AI data centers listed yet.** The Permitting Council’s dashboard shows covered/transparency projects; as of today there’s **no clearly labeled AI data center project** posted. (Categories are public, but specific AI DC entries aren’t there yet.) [Performance.gov Permitting Council](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The update of you can begin construction now before needing the Clean Air Act NSR air permits are needed to begin non-emitting work. That's massive. I believe this could usher in commitments and deal sign-offs a lot sooner.

You show the hyperscaler you have a powered shell commit and they are ready to contract up; right way. For these reasons I believe we may get a massive new deal in the range of $22 - $50 Billion dollars to assure that whatever capacity Galaxy and CoreWeave yield is committed to throughout a longer 7 - 10 year capacity commitment.

This is the only thing that makes sense for what Galaxy is doing. Of course I could be wrong or my timeline could be way off so we shall see.

Here is Helios in 2024

https://preview.redd.it/1xnbc7o6fjof1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0cc8822e2da508d1f6f22ff0731f17439bf719

If this looks crude and unorganized but effective that's because it is. This is mostly the power Galaxy's Helios had up and running for coin mining operations converted now over for the AI new big oil gold rush.

Interestingly Nvidia (NVDA) has released a new blog post on September 9th 2025 giving reference designs for what Giga-Scale AI Factories should look like and as you see the comparison they are nothing what the current Helios design looks like today.

[NVIDIA Partners With AI Infrastructure Ecosystem to Unveil Reference Design for Giga-Scale AI Factories](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-factories-reference-design/)

At the AI Infrastructure Summit, NVIDIA’s Ian Buck introduces a reference design and partner-driven strategy to transform global infrastructure for high-performance, energy-efficient AI.

https://preview.redd.it/crm4amz8fjof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a727438a89a019d52ad6e012a73f53ec06da4f2

Data center Giga-Scale factories are here and Galaxy has a front row seat to massive income and incoming AI capex. Hyperscalers are paying out huge amounts of cash to anyone and everyone who can procure massive amounts of power. Galaxy is actively doing just this.

**My current positions:** I've opened a small position in GLXY and will be adding more Today!

Chewy just delivered a solid quarter. Revenue and earnings beat expectations, full-year guidance was raised, and margins are improving. Autoship now accounts for most sales, customer spend per year is climbing, and Chewy+ membership is gaining traction. The result is a business with sticky recurring revenue in a consumer sector that otherwise looks shaky.

Analysts are shifting bullish, with upgrades from major banks and price targets in the mid to high 40s. If the stock re-rates back toward that range, these calls offer significant upside.

The risk is customer growth, which missed estimates last quarter and weighed on sentiment. If that trend continues, the stock may stall and the trade loses value quickly.

The catalyst is simple. Strong earnings momentum, analyst upgrades, and stable fundamentals give the stock room to move higher.

1ndis0f,wallstreetbets,Why would hyperscalers spend so much with $ORCL instead of just spending themselves?,"UPDATE: It's apparently$300B just from OpeniAI. So yeah, like I hypothesized, the hyperscalers don't need shit from Oracle and there is a high chance most of this doesn't happen. OpenAI can't afford $300B.

I don't get it. They say they got $400B in backlogs from only a few customers, which means like $100B+ per customer. Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon...

There are a handful of companies on the entire planet which that describes, and they can build their own stuff. Why, for example, would Meta or Amazon give Oracle $50B just to build a data center that doesn't even exist yet anyway?

It's one thing to buy infrastructure that already exists and that you want right now, it's another thing to order infrastructure that doesn't even exist when you already know how to build your own.

The whole cloud revenue/order backlog thing looks like bullshit to me. It's going to grow $144B in cloud revenue in 5 years?

1ndfwkt,wallstreetbets,CHEWY Oversold on Solid Eearnings,"Dear Regards,

I'll keep it short. Check my earlier posts on WSB to see my trackrecord of picking stocks. My previous pick was Droneshield right before it went up by a multiple.

Right now I am long on CHEWY. The online animal food and animal pharmacy retailer that cultivates customer loyalty like no other. Look them up online, look up the reviews. You will find loads of extremely positive reviews and almost no negatives. Except from FedEx transporters that hate them because they have to ship so many Chewy packages. No joke.

And at the same time they match the prices of Amazon. Most of their customers use the auto shipping service. Meaning they are locked in, loyal customers with no reason to leave. Another plusside is that right now, their main focus is on the US and a bit on Canada. In time they plan to sell in Europe too. A lot of room to grow. 

Cons:

\- Their CEO and CFO take home too much compensation compared to the size of the company. 

\- They're slow on the EU expansion. It was announced in 2023, yet no concrete plan has been presented.

\- Their businessmodel of excellent customerservice is expensive and cannot be replaced by AI. So when others do replace more of their customer service with AI, they will have to squeeze their margins to stay competitive. However this may also convince people to buy from Chewy. Because AI customers service sucks.



I believe in their longterm potential and that the current price drop is a nice discount on the price.

1nddyqw,wallstreetbets,$CRWV DD - CoreWeave is Low Balling Their Year End Guide by 22%-40% while $NBIS Has their Microsoft Deal Already Max Priced for 2025,"Contracts are nice but there is a major caveat -- How much can you actually scale to realize those revenues. Now, I am fully disclosing upfront that I expect NBIS to run a lot higher from here. I may be wrong but that's what I expect and that's my bet.

Still, Nebius trades at a premium when it comes to CoreWeave based on core cloud revenues. The price to annual recurring revenue is quite telling.

**Cloud revenue ratio**

* Metric | Q2 CRWV | Q2 NBIS | Ratio
* Cloud rev | $1.213B | $105.1M | \~11.5–12×

**Run-rate valuation (apples-to-apples)**

* Company | Market cap (we’re using: CRWV $48B; NBIS $22.9B) | ARR (cloud) | P/ARR
* CRWV | 48B | \~$4.85B | \~9.9×
* NBIS | 22.9B | \~$0.43B | \~53×

To be fair, post IPO lock-up there has been selling by insiders for CoreWeave that have had their share for a very long time. The disparity of the P/ARR is most likely due to that and not the debt financing. Sure people rail on that because they have nothing better to due but I assure you when the selling stops this stock will pop. Selling as of now is a momentum killer for CoreWeave.

With that being said, there is a reality and to me that reality is grounded by one fact alone. How much MegaWatts of power can you stand-up by end-of-year. Then to normalize that we can take current Q2 known revenues and apply them to what we know as being current standing powered shells or MW's.

It doesn't matter what the contracts are that are put into the backlog the game here is what can you actually bring online in terms of actively running powered shells. Literally the contracts are written this way. You don't come online-no pay, no delivered throughput of GPU'S - you don't get paid. If it's bad enough you can lose the entire contract.

Now, I am not totally sure what Nebius's current standing powered shell capacity is in terms of MW's but I am estimating somewhere between 40 - 55 current MW's. Remember the NJ Vineland rollout, which Microsoft just contracted to, is for that facility. If someone knows of another one please let me know. As of now, it's phase 1 2025 \~100 MW and phase 2 2026 \~100 MW although it is said can expand up to 300-MW and perhaps there will be great motivation for this. After all, Mark Zuckerberg did say he was putting up GPU tent cities.

The last thing before we get into graphs and figures. You'll begin to question the Microsoft contract for Nebius and how they will actually be able to achieve that without perhaps rolling into capacity handovers to CoreWeave or others just to buy them more time perhaps. Meaning, $17 billion can't possibly be a revenue for Nebius recognized in their quarters for probably 3 years or more.

This would be the major analyst question on upcoming Nebius calls that I want to hear the answer too. 100,200,300 MW isn't going to bring in more than what you are kind of guiding to on the top end of 2026 at 200 MW \~$500 - $700 M quarterly revenues by end of 2026. Surely that is not coming anywhere close in 2025. The contract is through 2031 but if they want to realize more of that revenue now then they are going to have to hurry and build and procure power as fast as humanly possible.

Again, this is a bit of an advantage for CoreWeave because they have so many data centers up and running and so many more coming online even in this year.

**NBIS NJ Vineland rollout and corresponding MSFT contract**

* Phase | Year | MW | Notes
* Phase 1 | 2025 | \~100 | contracted
* Phase 2 | 2026 | \~100 | contracted
* Expandable | Future | up to 300 | site design cap

**Baseline inputs of revenue generated per known MW's**

* Company | Q2 cloud rev | Active MW (Q2) | $/MW/qtr
* CRWV | $1.213B | \~470 | \~$2.58M
* NBIS | $105.1M | \~40–55 (use 50 midpoint) | \~$2.10M (range \~$1.91–2.63M)

https://preview.redd.it/5pcgvchk4cof1.png?width=2616&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ddfce7ea4f21947704c643845420b095a1eb2c7

So now that we have a normalized Revenue per MW or R / MW now we can analyze our second graph in earnest. For the Year-End-2025 this is where each company would be for their respective MegaWatt online completions.

Simply, CoreWeave is expected / guided to bring online > 900 MW of total power active YE'25 and Nebius is expected to bring on \~100 MW of total power active YE'25.

**YE’25 MW & implied Q4 cloud revenue**

* Company | YE MW target | Low/Mid/High $/MW | Implied Q4 rev
* (CRWV: >900 MW; NBIS: \~100 MW)

https://preview.redd.it/ddmwt45o4cof1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a0198016c211b09af93d70da0a04a7dd3888b

Now what's interesting here is that one has guided to the top and one has low balled to the bottom.

If you use the $1.91 - $2.63M for Nebius you would assume on 100 MW of year-end power they would be at a Q4 revenue projection of $.19B - $.263B and their corresponding guide is $.225-$.275B per quarter. That is right in line and a little higher even for the maxed out scale of 100 MW by ye'25.

On the other hand, CoreWeave has a 22%(top)-40%(bottom) upside on their current ranged guide. So if we're tracking that's a massive whisper number that if they meaningfully bring more than 900 MW online we could see some pretty wild beats on the earnings heading into 2026.

* **CoreWeave:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $2.32B**/qtr vs. guidance: **Q3 $1.26–$1.30B** and FY’25 **$5.15–$5.35B**, which implies **Q4 need ≈ $1.66–$1.90B**. So our figure is **\~22–40% above** the guidance-implied Q4.
* **Nebius:** Our implied **Q4 ≈ $0.19–$0.26B**/qtr vs. YE’25 **ARR guidance $0.9–$1.1B** (**≈$0.225–$0.275B per quarter**). So our figure is **within or just below** their guided band.

Visually this is what CoreWeave's surprise guides may yield.

https://preview.redd.it/9ieydcgq4cof1.png?width=2223&format=png&auto=webp&s=36683ef74b32c8604fe94c57a2a3057eb79a9362

Look at the comparison between both CoreWeave and NBIS in terms of where they are guiding per predicted active powered capabilities by year-end.

To illustrate the point here are two Q4 predictive sensitivity guides based on increases/decreases in R / MW.

CoreWeave could whisper out to a major upside because they're MW projection for revenue is coming in lowballed. Red is the current guide and black squares are the reasonably expected guide with powered shells coming online.

https://preview.redd.it/pztqi2nt4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a9bba8db0c4a99e3b749b21c7c4de473d1b6c1

For Nebius because they've guided so high you only can see an effective top end of their guide range.

https://preview.redd.it/mdnstgcw4cof1.png?width=2001&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa3212d3e485cd3f396d68d13aca4fb9a2a1a04

With all that said, and again with the caveat of CoreWeave is post IPO selling. How is the P/ARR not more normalized. At some point they either all go to \~10 or one raises and the other recedes. The sky is blue and the sun is white; yeah I know.

BUT can CoreWeave not have the luxury of a little more leeway to their P/ARR once the selling stops?

Here is what would happen if you averaged the too P/ARR's based on a stock price of $100 which is close to where they are today. Effectively, if CoreWeave had half of the P/ARR today this would give a multiple of x 3.34 on the stock price while reducing NBIS's share price by 1/3.

https://preview.redd.it/ugoj5opy4cof1.png?width=4132&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3f116ec66411ca98debacca0496f03f41dd0d1

This is as of today what the stock price would be if CoreWeave had even close to what NBIS's P/ARR was. Overtime I expect they both settle into a P/ARR and then a P/E of about 15 - 25 if they are still aggressively growing.

If you have anything to add or corrections I will update the model forecasting.

This is not financial advice or advisor.

1nda69a,wallstreetbets,$100K on BTBT Because the Market Doesn’t Understand it owns 74% of WYFI,"Everyone is talking about NBIS and its new mega contract with MSFT.

Me?  I’m focused on the next NBIS, which is BTBT.

The thesis is simple.  BTBT is trading at a massive discount to its intrinsic value right now.

Here is the math:

BTBT owns 121,252 ether in its treasury, valued today at ~$525 million.

BTBT also owns a 74% stake in WYFI, an AI Infrastructure/GPU cloud provider that it recently spun off in an IPO.  At $18.95, WYFI market cap is ~$717 million.  BTBT’s 74% stake = $530mm.

So thats $1.05 Billion in intrinsic value for BTBT when you combine its ether holdings and stake in WYFI.

What’s BTBT trading at?  $2.77/share or $890 million in market cap.  This is a 16% discount to its intrinsic value of $1.05 Billion.

Many Wall Street analysts from Needham to Macquarie have price targets on WYFI much higher ($25-$34/share).  Many analysts also have targets on ether that are much higher $10K+.

You do the math for what this could mean for BTBT.  The upside is legitimately insane.  The market is completely asleep on this massive opportunity but when people wake up, BTBT will absolutely soar.",182,63,2025-09-10 10:09:02,https://i.redd.it/0akwrukoabof1.jpeg,2025-10-03 09:04:00.779482

1nd9fpz,wallstreetbets,$100k+ in HIMS - Gym Bro Formation Spotted - $60+ Breakout,"I was at the gym today, and I saw that 50% at 24 hour fitness were too jacked. That basically represents half of America and a huge target audience, which means revenue growth of half of America. Hims is doing 544m in revenue, but there's 170 million men in America. So if each man spends $10 a year, that's 1.7B in revenue to hims. Since each man wants to be jacked, and then the existing 50% want to stay jacked. 

And then I realized, if you plotted the gym bro on top of the graph, it shows consolidation. From the first arm day, into a break, then the rest day before the next pump. 

And then that's where I realized, HIMS will also break through that plateau as well because of performance enhancing drugs. And then just keep going without needing more rest days. The guy I saw at the bench press was watching the anime ""Onegai Muscle"", which means HIMS will too get the same anime plot armor from the muscle growth.

If you look at the lines, it shows the muscle growth TA formation, which means a breakout above $50+ and onward to $60. 

So therefore HIMS stock should breakout beyond $60+ and why I bought $100k+ in hims.",252,58,2025-09-10 09:23:28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nd9fpz,2025-10-03 09:04:00.779497

That’s cool to see as an outsider - unless you were in the room when they centralized options tracking and came up with the idea in 2014 to monitor for a stock to cross 100% of outstanding and missed it. Was still happy to just be alive and to see you all make bank even if I was literally going through a bankruptcy as it happened.

Back in February, I got horny for tendies and loaded up on GOOGL $150 LEAPS (01/16/26) for a fat -21k debit. My boomer brain thought, “Google basically owns the internet, AI is juicing the stonk, how bad could it be?”

Fast forward to last week, and those bad boys went vertical harder than my uncle after a couple blue pills. I panic-sold (because I’m still a paper-handed coward at heart) and locked in +41,500 on the same contracts. Net? Walked away with about +20.5k profit.

For once, the WSB prophecy came true: buy calls, wait, ???, profit.

TL;DR: Bought GOOGL $150 LEAPS for $21k → sold them for $41.5k → walked with $20.5k gain → still don’t know what I’m doing.
