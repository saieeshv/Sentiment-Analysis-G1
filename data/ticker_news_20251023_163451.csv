AAPL,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 16:34:30.864157,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY) is definitely on the radar of institutional investors who own 38% of the company,"Key Insights

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Gateley (Holdings)'s stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

53% of the business is held by the top 3 shareholders

Recent purchases by insiders

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

If you want to know who really controls Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 38% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Gateley (Holdings).

Check out our latest analysis for Gateley (Holdings)

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Gateley (Holdings)?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Gateley (Holdings). This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Gateley (Holdings), (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Gateley (Holdings) is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Gateley (Holdings) Plc Employee Benefit Trust is the largest shareholder with 31% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.6% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Roderick Waldie, the CEO has 0.9% of the shares allocated to their name.

A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 53% stake.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Gateley (Holdings)

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Gateley (Holdings) Plc. It has a market capitalization of just UK£160m, and insiders have UK£3.2m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Gateley (Holdings). While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With an ownership of 13%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that Gateley (Holdings) is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...

AAPL,Asian shares slip on selling of tech stocks after a lackluster day on Wall Street,"Asian shares were mostly lower Wednesday on selling of technology shares following a lackluster day on Wall Street.

U.S. futures edged higher, while crude oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel.

Chinese markets retreated after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on whether or not he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month.

“Maybe it won't happen, maybe it won't happen,” he said while hosting a lunch for Republican Party senators at the White House.

However, Trump also said he was expecting “to do well” in negotiations with China.

“I’m going to see President Xi in two weeks. ... We’re going to meet in South Korea, ” he said. “We’re going to talk about a lot of things they want to discuss.”

Trump is traveling in the next several days to Japan and South Korea, in part, to finalize the terms of investments from those countries as part of an agreement to minimize the tariff rates Trump is charging on foreign goods.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.8% to 25,819.10, while the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.1% to 3,914.97.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 wavered between slight gains and losses a day after its parliament chose Sanae Takaichi to be its first female prime minister.

It closed almost flat at 49,307.79, pulled lower by declines for tech companies like SoftBank Group Corp., whose shares fell about 5%.

The government reported that Japan’s exports grew 4.2% in September from a year earlier, boosted by robust shipments to Asia that offset a 13% decline in those destined for the U.S. Auto shipments fell 24% as they were hit hard by Trump’s tariff hikes.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 9,030.00, while South Korea's Kospi rose 1.6% to 3,883.68.

Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 inched up a fraction of a point, leaving it just slightly below its all-time high set earlier this month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to a new record and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.

General Motors rallied 15.1% after reporting stronger quarterly results than analysts expected, while also raising its forecasts for some full-year financial targets. Warner Bros. Discovery leaped 10.9% after the company said it’s now considering other options besides its previously announced split of Discovery Global off Warner Bros., which could be more profitable for shareholders.

Keeping the market in check were drops for some Big Tech stocks, which lost momentum following their own rallies. A 2% drop for Google's parent company, Alphabet, from its all-time high was among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. So was Broadcom's 2% fall.

The pressure is on companies to show that their profits are growing following a torrid rally of 35% for the S&P 500 from a low in April. It’s one way they can justify their high stock prices amid criticism that they’re too expensive.

Corporate earnings reports also can provide details on the strength of the U.S. economy at a time when the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important economic updates. That’s making the job of the Federal Reserve more difficult, as it tries to decide whether high inflation or the slowing job market is the bigger issue for the economy.

Despite the shutdown, the Commerce Department will release its consumer prices report on Friday, which could help guide the Fed’s interest rate policy. It will be the government’s first data release since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

In other dealings early Wednesday, the price of gold was up 1.1% at $4,152.70 per ounce. It fell 5.7% from its latest record on Tuesday but is up more than 56.4% for the year.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.18 to $58.42 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, jumped $1.23 to $62.55 a barrel.

The U.S. dollar fell to 151.74 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro cost $1.1611, up from $1.1600.

AAPL,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

AAPL,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 16:34:38.019036,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 16:34:38.021259,0.7,
AAPL,"Nifty eyes 26,000 breakout: What traders should watch out for","The domestic market is poised for an eventful session as the Nifty 50 inches closer to the 26,000 mark, the level that traders have been eyeing for weeks.

After a strong rally in recent sessions, sentiment remains upbeat, supported by earnings from heavyweight sectors and sustained foreign inflows. However, market participants are also cautious, awaiting fresh cues.

Analysts suggest that the Nifty’s immediate resistance lies near the 26,000 zone. In the short term, a rally towards 26,000/26,200 looks possible, while support is placed at 25,700,” Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said.

Meanwhile, market experts suggest that the long-term outlook for equities remains constructive.

Investors will also watchout for upcoming earnings announcements, global market trends, especially US Treasury yields and crude oil prices.

The performance of IT and banking stocks, which collectively carry significant weight in the index, will also be in focus.

Equity indices ended marginally higher in the special Muhurat Trading session on Tuesday. Vinit Bolinjkar - Head of Research - Ventura, said, “We are targeting 27,600 for the Nifty in the next Samvat. Similarly, we expect the Sensex to reach 90,100 during the same period”

Key drivers for this potential upside include a domestic consumption-driven earnings revival from Q3FY26, a possible US–India trade deal, and fiscal and monetary support, including rate cuts and increased government capex, he added.

Market is closed on Wednesday, October 22, 2025, on account of Balipratipada. In the last trading session, Nifty ended at 25,868.60, up 25.45 points or 0.10 per cent, and Sensex closed at 84,426.34, up 62.97 points or 0.07 per cent.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

AAPL,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 16:34:38.020956,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

GOOGL,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile.

GOOGL,Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY) is definitely on the radar of institutional investors who own 38% of the company,"Key Insights

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Gateley (Holdings)'s stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

53% of the business is held by the top 3 shareholders

Recent purchases by insiders

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

If you want to know who really controls Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 38% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Gateley (Holdings).

Check out our latest analysis for Gateley (Holdings)

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Gateley (Holdings)?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Gateley (Holdings). This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Gateley (Holdings), (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Gateley (Holdings) is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Gateley (Holdings) Plc Employee Benefit Trust is the largest shareholder with 31% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.6% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Roderick Waldie, the CEO has 0.9% of the shares allocated to their name.

A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 53% stake.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Gateley (Holdings)

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Gateley (Holdings) Plc. It has a market capitalization of just UK£160m, and insiders have UK£3.2m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Gateley (Holdings). While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With an ownership of 13%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that Gateley (Holdings) is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...

GOOGL,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 16:34:40.018063,0.9999999999999999,
GOOGL,Asian shares slip on selling of tech stocks after a lackluster day on Wall Street,"Asian shares were mostly lower Wednesday on selling of technology shares following a lackluster day on Wall Street.

U.S. futures edged higher, while crude oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel.

Chinese markets retreated after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on whether or not he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month.

“Maybe it won't happen, maybe it won't happen,” he said while hosting a lunch for Republican Party senators at the White House.

However, Trump also said he was expecting “to do well” in negotiations with China.

“I’m going to see President Xi in two weeks. ... We’re going to meet in South Korea, ” he said. “We’re going to talk about a lot of things they want to discuss.”

Trump is traveling in the next several days to Japan and South Korea, in part, to finalize the terms of investments from those countries as part of an agreement to minimize the tariff rates Trump is charging on foreign goods.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.8% to 25,819.10, while the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.1% to 3,914.97.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 wavered between slight gains and losses a day after its parliament chose Sanae Takaichi to be its first female prime minister.

It closed almost flat at 49,307.79, pulled lower by declines for tech companies like SoftBank Group Corp., whose shares fell about 5%.

The government reported that Japan’s exports grew 4.2% in September from a year earlier, boosted by robust shipments to Asia that offset a 13% decline in those destined for the U.S. Auto shipments fell 24% as they were hit hard by Trump’s tariff hikes.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 9,030.00, while South Korea's Kospi rose 1.6% to 3,883.68.

Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 inched up a fraction of a point, leaving it just slightly below its all-time high set earlier this month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to a new record and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.

General Motors rallied 15.1% after reporting stronger quarterly results than analysts expected, while also raising its forecasts for some full-year financial targets. Warner Bros. Discovery leaped 10.9% after the company said it’s now considering other options besides its previously announced split of Discovery Global off Warner Bros., which could be more profitable for shareholders.

Keeping the market in check were drops for some Big Tech stocks, which lost momentum following their own rallies. A 2% drop for Google's parent company, Alphabet, from its all-time high was among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. So was Broadcom's 2% fall.

The pressure is on companies to show that their profits are growing following a torrid rally of 35% for the S&P 500 from a low in April. It’s one way they can justify their high stock prices amid criticism that they’re too expensive.

Corporate earnings reports also can provide details on the strength of the U.S. economy at a time when the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important economic updates. That’s making the job of the Federal Reserve more difficult, as it tries to decide whether high inflation or the slowing job market is the bigger issue for the economy.

Despite the shutdown, the Commerce Department will release its consumer prices report on Friday, which could help guide the Fed’s interest rate policy. It will be the government’s first data release since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

In other dealings early Wednesday, the price of gold was up 1.1% at $4,152.70 per ounce. It fell 5.7% from its latest record on Tuesday but is up more than 56.4% for the year.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.18 to $58.42 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, jumped $1.23 to $62.55 a barrel.

The U.S. dollar fell to 151.74 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro cost $1.1611, up from $1.1600.

GOOGL,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

GOOGL,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

GOOGL,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 16:34:39.355723,0.7,
GOOGL,"Nifty eyes 26,000 breakout: What traders should watch out for","The domestic market is poised for an eventful session as the Nifty 50 inches closer to the 26,000 mark, the level that traders have been eyeing for weeks.

After a strong rally in recent sessions, sentiment remains upbeat, supported by earnings from heavyweight sectors and sustained foreign inflows. However, market participants are also cautious, awaiting fresh cues.

Analysts suggest that the Nifty’s immediate resistance lies near the 26,000 zone. In the short term, a rally towards 26,000/26,200 looks possible, while support is placed at 25,700,” Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said.

Meanwhile, market experts suggest that the long-term outlook for equities remains constructive.

Investors will also watchout for upcoming earnings announcements, global market trends, especially US Treasury yields and crude oil prices.

The performance of IT and banking stocks, which collectively carry significant weight in the index, will also be in focus.

Equity indices ended marginally higher in the special Muhurat Trading session on Tuesday. Vinit Bolinjkar - Head of Research - Ventura, said, “We are targeting 27,600 for the Nifty in the next Samvat. Similarly, we expect the Sensex to reach 90,100 during the same period”

Key drivers for this potential upside include a domestic consumption-driven earnings revival from Q3FY26, a possible US–India trade deal, and fiscal and monetary support, including rate cuts and increased government capex, he added.

Market is closed on Wednesday, October 22, 2025, on account of Balipratipada. In the last trading session, Nifty ended at 25,868.60, up 25.45 points or 0.10 per cent, and Sensex closed at 84,426.34, up 62.97 points or 0.07 per cent.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

GOOGL,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 16:34:39.355566,0.9999999999999999,

GOOGL,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

MSFT,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 16:34:40.585139,0.9999999999999999,
MSFT,Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY) is definitely on the radar of institutional investors who own 38% of the company,"Key Insights

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Gateley (Holdings)'s stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

53% of the business is held by the top 3 shareholders

Recent purchases by insiders

AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.

If you want to know who really controls Gateley (Holdings) Plc (LON:GTLY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 38% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Gateley (Holdings).

Check out our latest analysis for Gateley (Holdings)

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Gateley (Holdings)?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Gateley (Holdings). This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Gateley (Holdings), (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Gateley (Holdings) is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Gateley (Holdings) Plc Employee Benefit Trust is the largest shareholder with 31% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.6% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Roderick Waldie, the CEO has 0.9% of the shares allocated to their name.

A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 53% stake.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of Gateley (Holdings)

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Gateley (Holdings) Plc. It has a market capitalization of just UK£160m, and insiders have UK£3.2m worth of shares, in their own names. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Gateley (Holdings). While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With an ownership of 13%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that Gateley (Holdings) is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...

MSFT,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 16:34:41.247720,0.9999999999999999,
MSFT,Asian shares slip on selling of tech stocks after a lackluster day on Wall Street,"Asian shares were mostly lower Wednesday on selling of technology shares following a lackluster day on Wall Street.

U.S. futures edged higher, while crude oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel.

Chinese markets retreated after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on whether or not he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this month.

“Maybe it won't happen, maybe it won't happen,” he said while hosting a lunch for Republican Party senators at the White House.

However, Trump also said he was expecting “to do well” in negotiations with China.

“I’m going to see President Xi in two weeks. ... We’re going to meet in South Korea, ” he said. “We’re going to talk about a lot of things they want to discuss.”

Trump is traveling in the next several days to Japan and South Korea, in part, to finalize the terms of investments from those countries as part of an agreement to minimize the tariff rates Trump is charging on foreign goods.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.8% to 25,819.10, while the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.1% to 3,914.97.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 wavered between slight gains and losses a day after its parliament chose Sanae Takaichi to be its first female prime minister.

It closed almost flat at 49,307.79, pulled lower by declines for tech companies like SoftBank Group Corp., whose shares fell about 5%.

The government reported that Japan’s exports grew 4.2% in September from a year earlier, boosted by robust shipments to Asia that offset a 13% decline in those destined for the U.S. Auto shipments fell 24% as they were hit hard by Trump’s tariff hikes.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 9,030.00, while South Korea's Kospi rose 1.6% to 3,883.68.

Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 inched up a fraction of a point, leaving it just slightly below its all-time high set earlier this month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to a new record and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.

General Motors rallied 15.1% after reporting stronger quarterly results than analysts expected, while also raising its forecasts for some full-year financial targets. Warner Bros. Discovery leaped 10.9% after the company said it’s now considering other options besides its previously announced split of Discovery Global off Warner Bros., which could be more profitable for shareholders.

Keeping the market in check were drops for some Big Tech stocks, which lost momentum following their own rallies. A 2% drop for Google's parent company, Alphabet, from its all-time high was among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. So was Broadcom's 2% fall.

The pressure is on companies to show that their profits are growing following a torrid rally of 35% for the S&P 500 from a low in April. It’s one way they can justify their high stock prices amid criticism that they’re too expensive.

Corporate earnings reports also can provide details on the strength of the U.S. economy at a time when the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important economic updates. That’s making the job of the Federal Reserve more difficult, as it tries to decide whether high inflation or the slowing job market is the bigger issue for the economy.

Despite the shutdown, the Commerce Department will release its consumer prices report on Friday, which could help guide the Fed’s interest rate policy. It will be the government’s first data release since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

In other dealings early Wednesday, the price of gold was up 1.1% at $4,152.70 per ounce. It fell 5.7% from its latest record on Tuesday but is up more than 56.4% for the year.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.18 to $58.42 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, jumped $1.23 to $62.55 a barrel.

The U.S. dollar fell to 151.74 Japanese yen from 151.93 yen. The euro cost $1.1611, up from $1.1600.

MSFT,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

MSFT,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

MSFT,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

After a strong rally in recent sessions, sentiment remains upbeat, supported by earnings from heavyweight sectors and sustained foreign inflows. However, market participants are also cautious, awaiting fresh cues.

Analysts suggest that the Nifty’s immediate resistance lies near the 26,000 zone. In the short term, a rally towards 26,000/26,200 looks possible, while support is placed at 25,700,” Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said.

Meanwhile, market experts suggest that the long-term outlook for equities remains constructive.

Investors will also watchout for upcoming earnings announcements, global market trends, especially US Treasury yields and crude oil prices.

The performance of IT and banking stocks, which collectively carry significant weight in the index, will also be in focus.

Equity indices ended marginally higher in the special Muhurat Trading session on Tuesday. Vinit Bolinjkar - Head of Research - Ventura, said, “We are targeting 27,600 for the Nifty in the next Samvat. Similarly, we expect the Sensex to reach 90,100 during the same period”

Key drivers for this potential upside include a domestic consumption-driven earnings revival from Q3FY26, a possible US–India trade deal, and fiscal and monetary support, including rate cuts and increased government capex, he added.

Market is closed on Wednesday, October 22, 2025, on account of Balipratipada. In the last trading session, Nifty ended at 25,868.60, up 25.45 points or 0.10 per cent, and Sensex closed at 84,426.34, up 62.97 points or 0.07 per cent.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

MSFT,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 16:34:40.587633,0.9999999999999999,

MSFT,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

AAPL,Apple (AAPL) Looks to iPhone Sales to Reignite Upgrade Supercycle,"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the smartphone powerhouse, is edging closer to a $4 trillion market valuation after its shares climbed 6% following an Oct. 20 report from Counterpoint Research. The report revealed that the iPhone 17 has outperformed its predecessor, the iPhone 16, during its first 10 days on the market. The bullish impetus has since cooled, with AAPL stock now trading around the $257 level.

The new model appears to have resolved several key technological issues that users had raised in recent years, reaffirming Apple’s reputation for innovation. The iPhone 17 lineup is also showing strong momentum in China—one of Apple’s most critical markets. Despite these encouraging trends, I remain Neutral on Apple stock, as I believe its current valuation already reflects the company’s underlying economic fundamentals.

iPhone 17 Gets Off to a Great Start

According to Counterpoint Research, Apple’s iPhone 17 series has achieved 14% higher sales than the iPhone 16 lineup during its first 10 days of availability in the U.S. and China—two of the company’s most critical markets. In China, the base iPhone 17 has emerged as the top seller, while in the U.S., strong demand for the iPhone 17 Pro Max has driven sales growth. Adding to the positive momentum, Apple’s eSIM-only model, the iPhone Air, recently received regulatory approval in China, with pre-orders beginning on October 17.

The iPhone 17’s robust early performance in China is particularly significant, given the company’s recent struggles. In Fiscal 2024, Apple reported an 8% year-over-year decline in China sales to $67 billion, followed by a further 4% drop in the first nine months of 2025.

The company has been losing ground to domestic competitors such as Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi (XIACF)—each gaining market share at Apple’s expense. From Q1 2024 to Q2 2025, Apple’s share of smartphone shipments fell by 100 basis points, while Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi gained 100, 300, and 200 basis points, respectively. The iPhone 17 series could help Apple reverse this trend and regain lost momentum in China during the current quarter.

Apple’s Pivot to Innovation is Promising

One of the main reasons I’m taking a neutral stance on Apple is the tech giant’s lackluster innovation pipeline. This lack of innovation was arguably one of the main reasons behind the company’s market share losses in China. According to Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong, Chinese consumers look for longer battery life, lighter designs, and AI-powered user experiences when they are purchasing a new smartphone.

Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI product suite, is not available in China due to regulatory barriers. Expectations are for these features to be rolled out in China later this year. However, even if these expectations come to fruition, there is no denying that Apple Intelligence significantly lags the AI experiences offered by local smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei. Apple has its work cut out to close this technological gap in the coming months to avoid losing further market share to local competitors.

What is encouraging, however, is Apple’s pivot to innovation with the release of the iPhone 17 series. Cameras have received a significant boost in the latest iPhone series, and the A19 chips used in new models are delivering a much better user experience. Additionally, the company has equipped the iPhone 17 series with “vapor chamber cooling” technology, which is expected to keep the device temperature in check even while using advanced AI features. Many users had previously complained of Apple iPhone devices heating uncontrollably while using advanced software features.

Apple’s renewed focus on innovation is a welcome sign for investors, as the company, without this focus, was expected to lose further market share in the all-important Mainland China market. Apple has also made an important decision to allow third-party app developers to access the core LLM that powers Apple Intelligence, which should enable them to add more AI features to their mobile applications.

What is the Target Price for AAPL?

On Wall Street, AAPL stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell ratings over the past three months. AAPL’s average stock price target of $261.68 implies approximately 2% upside potential over the next twelve months.

Wall Street analysts generally view Apple as fairly valued at current levels. While the iPhone 17 series has the potential to spark a major smartphone upgrade cycle—driven by its enhanced camera capabilities, lightweight design (notably the iPhone Air), and integrated AI features—I also consider Apple’s valuation to be complete at a forward P/E of 36x.

The company is currently trading at a premium compared to leading AI players such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG), which, in my view, limits the margin of safety for investors, especially since Apple remains several years behind its big-tech peers in fully leveraging artificial intelligence.

iPhone Momentum Insufficient to Extend Upside

The iPhone 17 series is showing strong early momentum in the U.S. and China—two of Apple’s most vital markets. The company’s renewed commitment to innovation is a positive development, especially after recent years when limited advancements, particularly in AI integration, led to market share losses in China.

However, despite these encouraging signs, I believe Apple’s stock remains fairly valued, as it continues to trade at a premium to major tech peers that have made more substantial progress in adopting AI. Accordingly, I maintain a neutral outlook on Apple’s prospects based on its current valuation.",Markets Insider,2025-10-23T06:37:40Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-aapl-looks-to-iphone-sales-to-reignite-upgrade-supercycle-1035417070,1.0,2025-10-23 16:34:45.381009,,0.192156862745098

Apple is upgraded to Buy as earnings quality and margin resilience exceed expectations despite tariff headwinds.

AAPL's Services segment now drives nearly a third of revenue, with gross margin near 75%, supporting stable company-wide margins of 46–47% or better.

Early iPhone 17 demand and a high-end product mix, along with geographic diversification of fabs, underpin margin durability into FY26.

Key risks include tariff pass-through, China execution, and AI investment pace, but strong cash generation and stable mix support a premium valuation.

I was on Hold for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (TSX:AAPL:CA) last time because tariff uncertainty and an iPhone-heavy mix left product margins and the multiple exposed, with little discount to history.

Since that April note, AAPL outperformed

AAPL,Walmart Stock (WMT) Flattens as it Pulls the Plug on Thousands of Overseas H-1B Visas,"Shares in retail giant Walmart (WMT) were flat today as it emerged that it has stopped hiring people who require controversial H-1B visas.

Thoughtful Employer

As first reported by Bloomberg, Walmart has decided to pause job offers to candidates using H-1B visas, marking a major move for the retail sector and U.S. business in general. That’s because Walmart gave the green light to more than 2,000 H-1B visas in the first half of this year, more than any other retailer.

A Walmart spokesperson said it is “committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”

The H-1B allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to work in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. Jobs in fields such as mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical sciences often qualify.

However, concerned that replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign workers poses a threat to national security, President Trump signed an executive order last month imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B applicants.

That’s up from an average cost of between $4,535 and $17,885.

Tech Impact

It had been expected that the biggest impact of the changes would be on the U.S. tech sector. Amazon (AMZN) had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025, with rivals such as Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) securing more than 4,000 visas.

Business groups have objected to Trump’s decision, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently filing a lawsuit against the administration. It believes that the increased fee harms American businesses and forces them to either increase labor costs or lose access to skilled overseas talent.

Trump, whose tariff policy has the creation and protection of American jobs at its heart, believes the opposite. It is why political decisions are such a key risk for companies, including Walmart, and their investors.

For Walmart, which is increasingly diversifying its business away from bananas and back-to-school clothes to technology, it could potentially stymie some of those moves. That includes new AI shopping assistants and partnerships with major tech names such as OpenAI.

Company overview

Company snapshot

Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD) is a large-scale fund with $8.12 billion in market capitalization and $1.16 billion in assets under management as of Q3 2025, delivering high monthly income through a covered call strategy on the NASDAQ-100 Index. The ETF systematically writes at-the-money call options to generate option premium.

Its Investment strategy is centered on tracking the performance of the CBOE NASDAQ-100 BuyWrite Index by holding NASDAQ-100 equities and writing monthly at-the-money covered call options.

QYLD's portfolio composition invovles concentrated exposure to NASDAQ-100 constituents, combining equity holdings with systematic call option overlays for income generation. Its fund structure is an exchange-traded fund with a non-diversified structure, passively managed to replicate the index methodology.

Foolish take

Steady income has always had a place in smart portfolios, especially when patience is tested across the market. Global X Japan's decision to expand its position in the Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD) shows how large investors are prioritizing dependable income over speculative gains.

Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD) delivers a near 13% yield by selling monthly call options on Nasdaq-100 stocks. This approach thereby transforms daily market swings into a steady source of cash flow. It does give up some upside in bull markets, however it does help provide a buffer when market turn volatile.

The fund's modest six percent decline this year contrasts with its double-digit yield, and it reflects the growing appeal of predictable returns in an environment where growth prospects vary across sectors.

For long term investors, QYLD offers much more than income. It represents a disciplined approach to navigating risks and uncertainty, and rewards patience rather than impulsive trading. As institutions and individuals alike search for stability, the fund's consistency reinforces a principle worth remembering. Its appeal lies in the simple idea that real investing success not from reacting quickly, but from holding patiently.

AAPL,The smartest ASX ETFs for beginner investors to buy,"Starting your investing journey can feel intimidating. With thousands of shares to choose from and endless opinions about where the market is headed, it is easy to feel stuck before you even begin.

That's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in.

They allow you to invest in hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of shares at once, giving you instant diversification and a stress-free way to build wealth over time.

If you're a beginner investor looking to start small and build a strong foundation, the three ASX ETFs listed below stand out right now. Here's why they could be smart picks:

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

If you want exposure to the world's best stocks, it is hard to look past the BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF. This fund tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the United States, which is home to some of the world's best-known brands.

Its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These are companies driving global technological change and long-term economic growth.

For beginners, this means that this ASX ETF offers a simple way to own a slice of the innovation shaping the future, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to e-commerce and digital advertising.

BetaShares Australian Quality ETF (ASX: AQLT)

While it is great to have global exposure, it is also smart to own a piece of Australia's strongest shares. The BetaShares Australian Quality ETF focuses on homegrown businesses with high returns on equity, low debt, and consistent earnings growth.

The fund's holdings include some of Australia's most respected names such as Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL), Pro Medicus Ltd (ASX: PME), Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG), and ResMed Inc. (ASX: RMD). These are companies that have built long-term competitive advantages and continue to generate solid profits year after year.

For new investors, the BetaShares Australian Quality ETF offers an easy way to own a basket of high-quality Australian shares without the need to pick individual winners. This provides a great foundation for the domestic portion of a beginner's portfolio.

BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF (ASX: ASIA)

Finally, the BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF could be a powerful way for beginners to tap into the growth story unfolding across Asia.

It invests in the region's biggest and most innovative tech companies, providing exposure to a market many Australian investors often overlook.

Its top holdings include Tencent Holdings (SEHK: 700), Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), and Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU).

These companies are shaping the future of digital life across Asia, from e-commerce and entertainment to cloud services and artificial intelligence. And with a rapidly growing middle class and rising technology adoption, the region is expected to remain one of the world's fastest-growing markets for years to come.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-23T07:18:55Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/23/the-smartest-asx-etfs-for-beginner-investors-to-buy/,0.5,2025-10-23 16:34:42.269796,,0.3254901960784313
AAPL,"Move Over, Magnificent 7: This 1 Rare Earth ETF Is Winning Over Wall Street Now","The fund currently holds 35 companies, with its top ten positions making up 49.19% of total assets. Among its leading names, Centrus Energy (LEU) (6.65%) represents the fund’s exposure to the growing nuclear energy and uranium segment. Core Natural Resources (CNR) (5.29%) and Coeur Mining (CDE) (5.27%) showcase its reach into mineral extraction and precious metals. Peabody Energy (BTU) (5.00%) strengthens the portfolio with its foothold in coal and energy transition materials, while Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) (4.91%) and Alcoa (AA) (4.70%) bring deep exposure to U.S. steel and aluminum output. The mix continues with Hecla Mining (HL) (4.58%), MP Materials (MP) (4.55%), Warrior Met Coal (HCC) (4.39%), and Steel Dynamics (STLD) (4.38%), all major contributors to America’s resurgent industrial engine.

The fund is valued at around $3.35 billion in assets, with its price at $100.32, a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 76.32%, and a 52‑week rise of 50.99% as of Oct. 20.

It maintains a modest annual dividend yield of 0.32% and a management fee of 0.35%, making it relatively cost-effective for its category. The ETF’s liquidity is also notable, with 3.46 million shares traded this month, up sharply from 1.97 million the month before. That’s a 76.07% increase, evidence that it has become a highly active fund amid renewed confidence in the metals space.

Domestic Metals Renaissance Supports XME’s Growth

One of the clearest catalysts supporting the rise of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF has been the impact of newly enacted U.S. tariffs on imported metals, which have reshaped the market’s supply dynamics and pricing power.

In the latest quarter, the U.S. expanded tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and finished metal products, aiming to safeguard domestic manufacturing and fortify key supply chains. These moves have pushed domestic prices higher, tightened global supply flows, and raised profitability expectations for U.S. producers, a dynamic that directly reinforces XME’s underlying index exposure.

That policy tailwind has coincided with a powerful lift in the broader metals complex. The industrial surge in silver, now trading around $52.24, marks its strongest level. Demand continues to scale with global renewable-energy buildouts, where silver’s use in solar panels and high-efficiency circuitry has made it almost indispensable.

Momentum doesn’t stop there. Gold’s recent run has earned the nickname “golden quarter,” rallying to roughly $4,124.30 per ounce. This strength stems from robust central bank accumulation and investors’ renewed appetite for stability amid an uncertain inflation path.

Conclusion

So, is XME really stepping into the spotlight the Magnificent 7 once owned? All signs suggest that it is. With tariffs pushing domestic metal prices higher, industrial demand for silver and copper holding firm, and gold and aluminum showing sustained strength, the fund’s rally seems rooted in real economic momentum, not speculation. Even if short-term pullbacks emerge, like today's 6.5% drop, the tone across the metals market remains visibly bullish. Unless demand cools sharply, XME’s trajectory still leans upward, a reminder that in 2025, hard assets are calling the market’s tune.",Yahoo!

GOOGL,Brasada Capital Third Quarter Of 2025 Quarterly Update,"Dear Clients and Friends,

Market Update

Despite the highest tariffs to US consumers since 1933 and a 22% correction in the S&P 500 (SP500), (SPX) earlier this year, we enter Q4 with equities near all-time highs and monetary policy easing. On Sept 17, the Fed cut short-term interest rates to 4.00%–4.25%, citing progress on inflation and softer labor. This supports growth without declaring victory. Headline consumer price index (CPI) is up 2.9% year-over-year; helpful but not a green light. Markets are pricing two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end to 3.50%–3.75%, which is contingent on cooling of core service and wage inflation. If inflation stalls, the Fed can pause which sets up a measured, not rapid cutting cycle.

Tariffs, having dominated headlines this year, have not spiked everyday prices as they’ve hit small-weighted categories of CPI (e.g., lumber, furnishings) but were offset elsewhere. Goods deflation and cheaper traded input helped, with import prices flat-to-down through mid-2025. Post-COVID, goods prices normalized as prices of used cars and durables rolled over and shipping got cheaper. A slight drop in housing rental prices also helped. Core PCE sits in the high-2s, with stickiness in services, not tariff-exposed goods. Relief in energy commodity prices also helped, even as electricity and natural gas prices rose. On a net basis: the major swing factors preventing regular Americans from feeling noticeable tariff pain were deflation across goods and import/shipping.

That said, low-income consumers are strained, while high-income consumers remain resilient. As short-term interest rates drift down and real incomes stabilize, 2026 could see a modest recovery in overall consumer spending. We prefer owning businesses with a higher-income customer base, durable pricing power, and clear value propositions over broad rate-sensitive cyclicals. Regarding confidence across the economy, we are watching for whether inflation re-accelerates (energy, tariffs) and the pace and for loosening of mortgage/credit.

On the corporate side, boardrooms are leaning into mergers & acquisitions. Valuations have re-accelerated even with mixed deal volumes as we see larger and strategic deals. This is due to funding costs easing and companies pursuing scale. Regulatory timing can stretch closings, but momentum is positive where synergies are real. We expect continued M&A across AI-adjacent tech, infrastructure, and select industrials with the middle-market improving as rate volatility fades.

Regarding earnings and valuation, profits must carry returns. With the S&P 500 near all-time highs and forward 12-mo price-to-earnings 22–22.5x (above 5- and 10-yr averages), expansion of stock valuation multiples is limited. The next leg up depends on continued profit growth and free cash flow durability. We continue to favor businesses with pricing power, high gross margins, recurring revenue, disciplined capital allocation, and improving efficiency.

Are we in a bubble?

Capex defined as Capital Expenditure

Corporate investment in Artificial Intelligence has been the primary driver of the market, with capital expenditure extending beyond GPUs to the entire infrastructure stack: power, networking, real estate, and software. However, the nature of this investment is undergoing a profound shift, and to understand it, we must look at the company at the center of it all: OpenAI.

To understand OpenAI's current position, the best historical analogy is not a recent mobile platform like iOS, but rather Microsoft (MSFT) Windows in the PC era. Just as Microsoft leveraged DOS, and the applications built for it to become the default operating system for the enterprise and then consumers, OpenAI has leveraged ChatGPT to aggregate hundreds of millions of users. This massive user base is the ultimate source of power, allowing OpenAI to exert gravitational pull on the entire AI value chain, from the chipmakers up to the cloud providers.

This leverage is now being used to orchestrate the buildout of the AI ecosystem on OpenAI's terms. Consider the chip layer:

Nvidia (NVDA): After receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia, OpenAI is deploying much of that capital to purchase Nvidia's chips.

AMD (AMD): To create a second source and reduce reliance on a single supplier, a playbook move straight from IBM (IBM)'s handling of Intel (INTC) in the 1980s, OpenAI struck a deal to purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD's chips. In return, AMD granted OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company.

What's notable is that these aren't straightforward transactions. They represent a form of vendor and circular financing, where capital and equity are exchanged in a closed loop. Skeptics point to this as being eerily reminiscent of Cisco (CSCO)'s vendor financing during the dot-com bubble, where Cisco would fund its own customers' purchases. This is the first clear sign that the market is entering a new, more speculative phase.

Until recently, the AI infrastructure boom could be characterized as a disciplined, although expensive, race funded almost entirely by the massive free cash flows of a few hyperscalers: Microsoft, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). That has fundamentally changed, and OpenAI is again the catalyst. To secure the staggering amount of computing power it needs, OpenAI has entered into massive, long-term contracts that its partners cannot fully fund from their own cash flow. The most prominent example is the reported ~$300 billion deal over five years with Oracle (ORCL) for compute capacity, linked to the ambitious ""Stargate"" data center project. To fulfill a contract of this magnitude—requiring an estimated 4.5 GW of power, Oracle has no choice but to tap the debt markets.

This is the inflection point. As Doug O’Laughlin from Fabricated Knowledge notes, the entrance of a debt-fueled player breaks the stable oligopoly.

""What we have lacked in this cycle so far is almost no debt-led funding. The Oracle RPO shows what’s possible if you’re willing to flex your balance sheet, and this will kick off an uneasy race... What had been a disciplined, cash-flow-funded race may now turn into a debt-fueled arms race.""

This shift into leverage and circular financing models feels like a classic late-cycle marker. It echoes the telecom bubble, where strategic equity spending gave way to massive debt issuance to fund fiber buildouts, leading to overcapacity and spectacular bankruptcies. Today, the profits in the AI industry are flowing primarily to the suppliers, Nvidia, data centers, and power companies, while the ""true AI companies"" face uncertain revenues and intense competition, another concerning sign.

This dynamic fits perfectly within the framework described by Byrne Hobart in his book Boom, which argues that capitalism occasionally disregards normal return-on-capital constraints to single-mindedly fund a new technology. Debt, as O'Laughlin states, is the ""real accelerant"". This FOMO-driven parallel investment can be incredibly productive, solving many interlocking problems at once.

The critical question for investors, however, is what durable infrastructure will remain if/when the bubble eventually bursts? The telecom boom left behind swathes of dark fiber that power our internet today. An AI bubble spent on GPUs with a three-year useful life offers a far less durable foundation. A bubble that spurred a massive buildout in power generation, on the other hand, would benefit the economy for decades to come.

Given these classic bubble markers—parabolic capex, a shift to debt and circular financing, and narrative-driven valuations—our approach remains cautious and selective.

Our Preference: We favor platforms with fortress balance sheets and repeatable free cash flow (namely hyperscalers like MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META) that can fund their AI ambitions internally and pace spending as monetization clarifies. Their diversified profit pools (cloud, ads, software) and control over distribution provide a cushion. We also favor the essential ""picks and shovels"" suppliers who own critical bottlenecks in the tech stack and get paid on the buildout, thus avoiding the downstream utilization risk.

Our Concern: The real risk lies with new entrants and those in the middle of the stack who lack diversified businesses, rely on speculative financing, and are entirely dependent on the hope that AI adoption and monetization will arrive before the funding dries up.

In short, while we see signs of a capital expenditure bubble, we believe this momentum-backed phase can persist. We will continue to participate selectively, focusing on companies where the moats and cash flows are real, while actively avoiding potential balance-sheet accidents.

Ferguson Plc (FERG)

Ferguson is the largest scaled specialty distributor for North American plumbing/HVAC/waterworks. Its revenue is split ~51% residential, 49% non-residential; ~60% repair & replace (R&R) and 40% new housing builds. About 85% of revenue is finished goods; plumbing is ~50% of mix. ~95% of revenue is U.S., the rest Canada. Their customer base comprises of 22% waterworks, 17% residential trade plumbing, 14% residential build/remodel, 14% commercial/mechanical, 14% fire/fabrication/facility/industrial, 12% HVAC, 7% residential digital.

When we began due diligence for Equity Income early in the year, sentiment was washed out: FERG shares traded down 16% post-earnings on fears of commodity deflation and weak outlook. Yet revenue held despite housing weakness. The market priced in zero new-home construction growth plus low-single-digit commodity price deflation. In our opinion, the stock selloff was overdone: (1) housing demand had been weak for over 2 years, (2) commodity products are only 25% of FERG’s mix, (3) specialty distributors had consistently shown pricing resilience. With residential (40% of revenue) in the 5th–6th inning of weakness and non-residential (waterworks/civil/infra) strong, the worst was past us.

The overhang was uncertainty on timing: new-home recovery might lag while non-residential could slow first. FERG’s share price implied only low-single-digit earnings growth over the next two years, but our math suggested an easy path to beating expectations. So far, pricing power has held, and non-residential demand has been solid.

Consistent with our playbook, we expect continued compounding organically and via accretive M&A. Management has consistently added 2 pts of growth from small bolt-on acquisitions at attractive valuations, with immediate profit uplift when plugged into Ferguson’s procurement, tech, and logistics rails. Scale drives a structural edge—better sourcing, working-capital efficiency, tech—and pricing has proven sticky through deflation scares.

Diversification has helped Ferguson outperform smaller, concentrated peers while housing construction remains stalled. Multi-year tailwinds persist in waterworks, commercial, civil infrastructure, and industrial; data-center buildouts also help pull through demand for commercial plumbing/HVAC/pipes/valves/fittings.

Broadcom (AVGO)

We added Broadcom to Equity Income in April; it has been our best year-to-date performer. A mega-cap semiconductor conglomerate, Broadcom sells primarily design and critical components for leading-edge chips as well as data-center infrastructure software. We believe the real fight in AI is between Nvidia and Broadcom. With a fresh inflection underway, Broadcom is positioned to be the #2—if not #1—winner over the next decade.

Led by arguably one of the greatest CEOs of all-time in Hock Tan, Broadcom excels at game-changing M&A and has consistently executed for shareholders producing one of the most successful stocks in the past 2 decades. It competes with NVIDIA in AI and networking chips, while its sticky, non-cyclical software (92% gross margin) buffers cyclicality in semiconductors. Whereas NVIDIA delivers general-purpose “glove-fits-all” compute stacks, Broadcom dominates custom AI chips (ASICs) with Google as its anchor customer, designing application-specific computing chips for Google’s (GOOG),(GOOGL) many applications (Search, YouTube, Cloud). Meta and OpenAI have also signed multi-billion-dollar deals to make their own chips. Custom-AI revenue rose 225% in 2024 to $8.6B and is expected to grow ~170%+ this year to $24B.

In networking, what allows these chips to talk to one another and work in conjunction and an adjacent and hypergrowth category in AI compute, Broadcom leads with Ethernet—the standard technology across non-AI clouds/enterprise data centers—pressuring proprietary approaches; NVIDIA in response even announced its own Ethernet solution.

Its data-center software (VMware) is the 800-lb gorilla in server virtualization, helping manage computing costs (including AI). This high-margin segment should grow teens this year as customers shift from licenses to subscriptions, then at least mid-single digits. Broadcom also holds a near-monopoly in iPhone connectivity (chips for cellular/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/GPS).

We bought our position after a >30% pullback in share prices on tariff fears that implied a 30% EPS cut over 2–3 years. We saw as severely oversold given (1) Broadcom’s lower China-tariff exposure, (2) Google’s rapid AI-chip progress driving demand for more chips from Broadcom and interest from other hyperscalers, (3) continued share gains/innovation in networking, and (4) upcoming recovery across Broadcom’s non-AI businesses.

Broadcom sits in a duopoly behind NVIDIA across the AI stack—owning the Ethernet scale-out, custom AI chips for the biggest buyers, a high-margin software cash engine, and iPhone connectivity. 2026 should be another step-up year in AI and networking, with subscriptions fueling steady free cash flow.

As always, we are grateful for your continued trust and partnership, and we are always happy to answer any questions you may have so please feel free to email, call, or come into the office to see us.

GOOGL,Why Shares of Alphabet (Google) Are Falling Today,"Key Points

Investors have been increasingly worried about how AI-powered browsers and search engines could impact Alphabet's largest revenue stream.

The search business is inherently different now with the advent of conversational chatbots.

Google has innovated as well, with AI overviews and its own AI Mode.

10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›

Despite a strong day in the broader market, shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) traded roughly 2.8% lower as of 12:59 p.m. ET today. The move came after ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, teased the launch of its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered web browser, ChatGPT Atlas.

A threat to search dominance

Earlier today on X, OpenAI posted a very short video teasing its new web browser, and CNBC reported that it will soon be available to the general public.

Investors have been increasingly concerned about the launch of AI-powered browsers and search engines when it comes to Alphabet, which has long dominated the search business. In fact, over half of Alphabet's revenue comes from search, so if these AI-powered browsers can take share of the market, Google and Alphabet could certainly be in trouble.

Google has responded with the creation of its AI-powered Overviews on top of search queries that are powered by Gemini. The company has also rolled out AI Mode, which seems similar to ChatGPT in that users can ask follow-up questions like with a conversational AI chatbot. For the most part, analysts have been impressed with the engagement between users and Google's AI-powered overviews.

The company owns many strong businesses

AI-powered browsers are certainly a threat to Google's search business, but this is a company with near-infinite resources that should be able to respond, as evidenced by the success of AI Overviews.

Alphabet also owns many spectacular businesses with strong growth prospects including Waymo, YouTube, Google cloud, a chip business, and a quantum project. Trading at about 25 times forward earnings, the stock is still a buy in my view.

GOOGL,Meta Layoffs Hit AI Division Amid Leadership Shake-Up,"Meta layoffs AI operations have hit the company’s artificial intelligence division, with the company letting go roughly 600 employees as part of what many describe as a major restructuring effort. The social media giant confirmed the Meta layoffs AI cuts on Wednesday, and the reductions affect workers across multiple teams, including infrastructure units, the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit, and various product-related positions within the Meta AI team.

The Meta layoffs AI announcement came through an internal memo from Alexandr Wang, who is Meta’s Chief AI Officer and joined the company back in June following the tech giant’s massive $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI.

Meta AI Team Restructure Signals New Leadership Direction

Wang Announces Restructuring Plans

Wang announced a memo to the Business Insider which was viewed as the Meta layoffs AI workforce reduction and it described how the firm plans to have a more nimble operation. The changes in the Meta AI team are an opportunity to allow faster decision-making and provide the remaining employees with increased scope and impact in their jobs.

Wang stated:

“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact.”

Surprisingly, even the employees of the TBD Labs, an elite department which has brought one of the best AI hires to the company this summer, were not affected by the Meta layoffs AI cuts. This discriminatory measure highlights the areas that Meta leadership is making its bets with, and they are not with the more costly new employees, but with the long-term employees who have been with the organization since childhood.

Internal Tensions and Resource Allocation

Within the company, teams like FAIR and more product-oriented groups have been vying for computing resources for some time now, as many considered the AI unit bloated. When the company created Superintelligence Labs, it inherited the oversized Meta AI unit along with all of its structural inefficiencies, which created friction and overlapping mandates.

Analysts view the Meta layoffs AI cuts as an attempt to cement Wang’s role in steering the company’s AI strategy going forward. Meta leadership decisions around who the cuts protected reveal the company’s priorities, with TBD Labs employees—whom Wang oversees—representing Meta’s most ambitious bet on achieving what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls “personal superintelligence.”

Severance Packages and Timeline

Meta notified affected Meta AI employees on Wednesday that November 21 is their termination date, and until then, they’re in what the company calls a “non-working notice period.” The company has already removed their internal access, but they can use this time to search for another role within Meta.

The company is offering 16 weeks of severance plus two additional weeks for every completed year of service, minus the notice period. Meta leadership has spun up what Wang described as a “tiger team of recruiters” to help the impacted group find new roles through an expedited hiring process.

No Decrease in AI Investment

Despite the Meta layoffs AI workforce reduction, Wang emphasized that the cuts don’t signal any pullback in investment. The Meta AI division will actually continue recruiting what he calls “industry-leading AI-native talent.” Even more, the goal is to enable the team to move faster and operate with greater agility.

Wang stated:

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading AI-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster.”

Also Read: OpenAI Bets $1 Trillion on AI, Has Five Years to Make It Work

As of writing, Meta Superintelligence Labs has close to 3,000 employees as a result of the Meta layoffs AI cuts. The reorganization is based on the increasing impatience of CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the progress of the Meta AI team, especially since developers received the launch of Llama 4 models by the company in April with a heavy dose of skepticism.

Smaller But Talent Richer Teams

In a bid to stay connected with its rivals like OpenAI and Google, the company has been investing billions on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure projects, as well as practices in staffing. In July, during the second-quarter earnings call, Meta announced that its total expenditure in 2025 would be in the range of between 114 billion and 118 billion and AI projects will see it grow its expenditure at a higher rate than it will grow in 2025.

The new practice of the Meta leadership approach is currently concentrating on smaller but talent richer teams which have the potential to make hasty decisions and this is what many are finding to be a significant break in to what the former organizational model was. This lean organization will show in the next couple of months whether it will provide the competitive benefits that Meta is seeking in the AI competition.",Watcher Guru,2025-10-23T07:17:14Z,https://watcher.guru/news/meta-layoffs-hit-ai-division-amid-leadership-shake-up,0.6,2025-10-23 16:34:47.263334,,0.2627450980392156
GOOGL,The smartest ASX ETFs for beginner investors to buy,"Starting your investing journey can feel intimidating. With thousands of shares to choose from and endless opinions about where the market is headed, it is easy to feel stuck before you even begin.

If you're a beginner investor looking to start small and build a strong foundation, the three ASX ETFs listed below stand out right now. Here's why they could be smart picks:

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

If you want exposure to the world's best stocks, it is hard to look past the BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF. This fund tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the United States, which is home to some of the world's best-known brands.

The fund's holdings include some of Australia's most respected names such as Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL), Pro Medicus Ltd (ASX: PME), Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG), and ResMed Inc. (ASX: RMD). These are companies that have built long-term competitive advantages and continue to generate solid profits year after year.

GOOGL,3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade | The Motley Fool,"What's a key downside of investing in a game-changing technology with fast-paced advances? One that immediately comes to mind is that there's no way to know for sure which stocks will be the biggest winners.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a great case in point. Some of the top AI names right now might not be at the top 10 years from now. Does this mean that buy-and-hold investing is futile with AI stocks? Not at all. Here are three AI stocks I think you can safely buy and hold for the next decade.

1. Alphabet

Once upon a time, some pundits predicted that generative AI would present an existential threat to Alphabet's (GOOG +0.47%) (GOOGL +0.46%) Google Search. You don't hear such dire warnings too much these days, though. Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Google Search continues to grow robustly.

Alphabet defied the expectations of some doomsayers by evolving its search engine to incorporate generative AI, introducing new features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode. The company also released one of the top-ranked large language models (LLMs) on the market, Google Gemini, which has an even more powerful version on the way soon.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in July, ""AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving

strong momentum."" He was right. His statement is especially true for Google Cloud. The unit's revenue soared 32% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining Google Cloud's position as the fastest-growing major cloud services provider.

I suspect we've only seen the beginning of how Alphabet will make money through AI. The company's Waymo business is a leader in the up-and-coming robotaxi market. Its Android XR operating system sets the stage for Alphabet to be a strong contender in the AI glasses market as well. I believe this company will be significantly larger 10 years from now, with AI serving as one of its biggest growth drivers.

2. Amazon

Amazon (AMZN 1.84%) recently made headlines with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that impacted many well-known businesses. I doubt many people will remember this public relations black eye a decade from now. Furthermore, I predict that AWS will rake in a lot more revenue than it does today.

Is AWS growing more slowly than its top rivals, such as Google Cloud? Yes. However, its revenue still jumped 17.5% year over year in Q2. And AWS continues to launch new capabilities, including agentic AI products, that should continue to attract new customers.

Meanwhile, Amazon is leveraging AI effectively to increase its overall profitability. For example, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model that controls over 1 million robots and is improving their travel efficiency. It's also using AI-powered demand forecasting to boost accuracy, optimize inventory placement, and reduce delivery times for millions of items purchased on its e-commerce platform.

Amazon is preparing to soon provide satellite internet service to customers using its Project Kuiper satellite network. I have no doubt the company will move into additional new markets over the next 10 years, some AI-related and others not.

3. Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT +0.57%) might have made the smartest deal in the age of AI so far with its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, the company has been able to integrate generative AI throughout its software products, making them more valuable than ever to users.

AI has also provided a huge tailwind for Microsoft Azure, which ranks as the second-largest cloud services provider after AWS. Business is booming for Azure, with Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment revenue jumping 27% year over year in its latest quarter.

Could Microsoft's momentum wane? Maybe, but I doubt it will. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the company's recent quarterly update, ""Cloud and AI is [sic] the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector."" The transformation he referred to is still in its early innings, in my view.

I think Microsoft's productivity products are ideal for agentic AI to show its value. I'm also glad to see the company expand its umbrella by offering Anthropic's Claude AI models as well as OpenAI's models in Microsoft 365 Copilot. This company, like Alphabet and Amazon, has staying power.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-23T07:53:55Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/23/3-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,0.4,2025-10-23 16:34:45.654100,,0.1137254901960785
MSFT,Apple (AAPL) Looks to iPhone Sales to Reignite Upgrade Supercycle,"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the smartphone powerhouse, is edging closer to a $4 trillion market valuation after its shares climbed 6% following an Oct. 20 report from Counterpoint Research. The report revealed that the iPhone 17 has outperformed its predecessor, the iPhone 16, during its first 10 days on the market. The bullish impetus has since cooled, with AAPL stock now trading around the $257 level.

The new model appears to have resolved several key technological issues that users had raised in recent years, reaffirming Apple’s reputation for innovation. The iPhone 17 lineup is also showing strong momentum in China—one of Apple’s most critical markets. Despite these encouraging trends, I remain Neutral on Apple stock, as I believe its current valuation already reflects the company’s underlying economic fundamentals.

iPhone 17 Gets Off to a Great Start

According to Counterpoint Research, Apple’s iPhone 17 series has achieved 14% higher sales than the iPhone 16 lineup during its first 10 days of availability in the U.S. and China—two of the company’s most critical markets. In China, the base iPhone 17 has emerged as the top seller, while in the U.S., strong demand for the iPhone 17 Pro Max has driven sales growth. Adding to the positive momentum, Apple’s eSIM-only model, the iPhone Air, recently received regulatory approval in China, with pre-orders beginning on October 17.

The iPhone 17’s robust early performance in China is particularly significant, given the company’s recent struggles. In Fiscal 2024, Apple reported an 8% year-over-year decline in China sales to $67 billion, followed by a further 4% drop in the first nine months of 2025.

The company has been losing ground to domestic competitors such as Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi (XIACF)—each gaining market share at Apple’s expense. From Q1 2024 to Q2 2025, Apple’s share of smartphone shipments fell by 100 basis points, while Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi gained 100, 300, and 200 basis points, respectively. The iPhone 17 series could help Apple reverse this trend and regain lost momentum in China during the current quarter.

Apple’s Pivot to Innovation is Promising

One of the main reasons I’m taking a neutral stance on Apple is the tech giant’s lackluster innovation pipeline. This lack of innovation was arguably one of the main reasons behind the company’s market share losses in China. According to Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong, Chinese consumers look for longer battery life, lighter designs, and AI-powered user experiences when they are purchasing a new smartphone.

Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI product suite, is not available in China due to regulatory barriers. Expectations are for these features to be rolled out in China later this year. However, even if these expectations come to fruition, there is no denying that Apple Intelligence significantly lags the AI experiences offered by local smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei. Apple has its work cut out to close this technological gap in the coming months to avoid losing further market share to local competitors.

What is encouraging, however, is Apple’s pivot to innovation with the release of the iPhone 17 series. Cameras have received a significant boost in the latest iPhone series, and the A19 chips used in new models are delivering a much better user experience. Additionally, the company has equipped the iPhone 17 series with “vapor chamber cooling” technology, which is expected to keep the device temperature in check even while using advanced AI features. Many users had previously complained of Apple iPhone devices heating uncontrollably while using advanced software features.

Apple’s renewed focus on innovation is a welcome sign for investors, as the company, without this focus, was expected to lose further market share in the all-important Mainland China market. Apple has also made an important decision to allow third-party app developers to access the core LLM that powers Apple Intelligence, which should enable them to add more AI features to their mobile applications.

What is the Target Price for AAPL?

On Wall Street, AAPL stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell ratings over the past three months. AAPL’s average stock price target of $261.68 implies approximately 2% upside potential over the next twelve months.

Wall Street analysts generally view Apple as fairly valued at current levels. While the iPhone 17 series has the potential to spark a major smartphone upgrade cycle—driven by its enhanced camera capabilities, lightweight design (notably the iPhone Air), and integrated AI features—I also consider Apple’s valuation to be complete at a forward P/E of 36x.

The company is currently trading at a premium compared to leading AI players such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG), which, in my view, limits the margin of safety for investors, especially since Apple remains several years behind its big-tech peers in fully leveraging artificial intelligence.

iPhone Momentum Insufficient to Extend Upside

The iPhone 17 series is showing strong early momentum in the U.S. and China—two of Apple’s most vital markets. The company’s renewed commitment to innovation is a positive development, especially after recent years when limited advancements, particularly in AI integration, led to market share losses in China.

However, despite these encouraging signs, I believe Apple’s stock remains fairly valued, as it continues to trade at a premium to major tech peers that have made more substantial progress in adopting AI. Accordingly, I maintain a neutral outlook on Apple’s prospects based on its current valuation.",Markets Insider,2025-10-23T06:37:40Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-aapl-looks-to-iphone-sales-to-reignite-upgrade-supercycle-1035417070,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-23 16:34:51.834246,,0.192156862745098

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in July, ""AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving

strong momentum."" He was right. His statement is especially true for Google Cloud. The unit's revenue soared 32% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining Google Cloud's position as the fastest-growing major cloud services provider.

I suspect we've only seen the beginning of how Alphabet will make money through AI. The company's Waymo business is a leader in the up-and-coming robotaxi market. Its Android XR operating system sets the stage for Alphabet to be a strong contender in the AI glasses market as well. I believe this company will be significantly larger 10 years from now, with AI serving as one of its biggest growth drivers.

2. Amazon

Amazon (AMZN 1.84%) recently made headlines with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that impacted many well-known businesses. I doubt many people will remember this public relations black eye a decade from now. Furthermore, I predict that AWS will rake in a lot more revenue than it does today.

Is AWS growing more slowly than its top rivals, such as Google Cloud? Yes. However, its revenue still jumped 17.5% year over year in Q2. And AWS continues to launch new capabilities, including agentic AI products, that should continue to attract new customers.

Meanwhile, Amazon is leveraging AI effectively to increase its overall profitability. For example, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model that controls over 1 million robots and is improving their travel efficiency. It's also using AI-powered demand forecasting to boost accuracy, optimize inventory placement, and reduce delivery times for millions of items purchased on its e-commerce platform.

Amazon is preparing to soon provide satellite internet service to customers using its Project Kuiper satellite network. I have no doubt the company will move into additional new markets over the next 10 years, some AI-related and others not.

3. Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT +0.57%) might have made the smartest deal in the age of AI so far with its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, the company has been able to integrate generative AI throughout its software products, making them more valuable than ever to users.

AI has also provided a huge tailwind for Microsoft Azure, which ranks as the second-largest cloud services provider after AWS. Business is booming for Azure, with Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment revenue jumping 27% year over year in its latest quarter.

Could Microsoft's momentum wane? Maybe, but I doubt it will. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the company's recent quarterly update, ""Cloud and AI is [sic] the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector."" The transformation he referred to is still in its early innings, in my view.

I think Microsoft's productivity products are ideal for agentic AI to show its value. I'm also glad to see the company expand its umbrella by offering Anthropic's Claude AI models as well as OpenAI's models in Microsoft 365 Copilot. This company, like Alphabet and Amazon, has staying power.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-23T07:53:55Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/23/3-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,0.4,2025-10-23 16:34:48.332158,,0.1137254901960785
MSFT,Billionaire Bill Gates Has 79% of His $48 Billion Portfolio Invested in Just 4 Stocks,"Key Points

The Gates Foundation Trust is the repository for the stocks that support the billionaire's charitable endeavors.

Most of the Trust's key holdings have long track records of success.

Some of these industry stalwarts pay a dividend, with this steady stream of income augmenting the Trust's charitable giving.

10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›

Most investors are familiar with Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist who cofounded Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). After heading up the technology conglomerate for 25 years, the chief executive stepped down to spend more time focusing on his charitable work. Gates is worth an estimated $106 billion, according to Forbes, making him the 18th richest person in the world.

The vehicle established to support his charitable endeavors is the Gates Foundation Trust. The mission of the trust is ""to create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life."" The foundation has donated more than $100 billion over the past 25 years, ""taking on the toughest, most important problems.""

While the Foundation owns stakes in dozens of companies, in the second quarter (the most recent data available), several well-known stocks top the list.

1. Microsoft: 27%

Given Gates' long history with the company, it shouldn't be a surprise that Microsoft tops the list -- particularly since he seeds the Trust through ongoing donations of Microsoft shares. The Gates Foundation owns more than 26 million shares of Microsoft stock, valued at $13 billion.

After it stagnated for more than a decade, CEO Satya Nadella breathed new life into the industry stalwart, making it a cloud staple and an artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse in the process.

In the calendar second quarter, Microsoft Azure was the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure provider, controlling 20% of the market, according to data aggregator Statista. It was also the fastest-growing of the ""Big Three"" cloud providers, growing 34% year over year. Total cloud revenue of $29.9 billion now accounts for 39% of Microsoft's total revenue and is its fastest-growing business segment. Demand for AI is helping fuel the company's cloud growth.

Finally, Microsoft's dividend track record stretches back to 2004, notching 16 consecutive annual increases. While the dividend yield is a seemingly paltry 0.7%, the stock has returned 140% over the past five years. Furthermore, its payout ratio of 23% is at its lowest level in 10 years. That gives Microsoft plenty of resources to boost its dividend for the foreseeable future.

2. Berkshire Hathaway: 25%

Warren Buffett and Gates cofounded the Giving Pledge in 2010, and Buffett plans to (eventually) donate all his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) stock to charity. Thus far, the Oracle of Omaha has given away more than $60 billion, encouraging other billionaires to take the pledge. It isn't surprising, then, that the Gates Foundation holds more than 24 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock, valued at $11.7 billion.

While the shares were donated, the Foundation has good reason to hold them. Berkshire's broad cross-section of businesses provides solid diversification and steady cash flow until the stock is liquidated to support charitable causes. Furthermore, despite its stodgy reputation, Berkshire stock has gained 135% over the past five years, outpacing the 96% returns of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).

Given Buffett's plans to step down this year, he's leaving the company in good hands, so it's not surprising that Berkshire stock represents such a large part of the Trust's holdings.

3. Waste Management: 15%

One person's trash is another person's treasure, according to the old adage, which helps make the case for Waste Management (NYSE: WM). That also helps to explain why the Gates Foundation holds a stake of more than 32 million shares of Waste Management stock, valued at nearly $7.4 billion.

Trash collection and recycling might also qualify as ""stodgy"" businesses, but these essential services generate consistent cash flow -- something Gates and Buffett both like. Furthermore, the company is expanding its services by diverting organic waste from its landfills and converting it into green energy to generate electricity or fuel vehicles.

Then there's the dividend, which Waste Management has boosted for 21 years running, currently yielding 1.5%. With a payout ratio of 46%, there's likely plenty more where that came from.

4. Canadian National Railway: 12%

Another industry that bears the Buffett seal of approval is railroads. Berkshire Hathaway famously bought up Burlington Northern Santa Fe lock, stock, and barrel in 2009. At the time, Buffett said railroads were a very ""cost-effective way"" to move goods, releasing ""far fewer pollutants into the atmosphere."" As a student of Buffett, it's no wonder the Gates Foundation holds nearly 55 million shares of Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI), worth $5.7 billion.

The company is the largest rail network in Canada and the only North American railway connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf Coasts, giving it a dominant position on the continent. Furthermore, railroads are generally much more efficient than even long-haul trucking. Add to that steep barriers to entry and a wide economic moat, and it's easy to see the allure.

Finally, Canadian National has consistently increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years and currently yields nearly 2.7%. Its relatively low payout ratio of 48% suggests its track record of payout increases will likely continue.

MSFT,"Move Over, Magnificent 7: This 1 Rare Earth ETF Is Winning Over Wall Street Now","The fund currently holds 35 companies, with its top ten positions making up 49.19% of total assets. Among its leading names, Centrus Energy (LEU) (6.65%) represents the fund’s exposure to the growing nuclear energy and uranium segment. Core Natural Resources (CNR) (5.29%) and Coeur Mining (CDE) (5.27%) showcase its reach into mineral extraction and precious metals. Peabody Energy (BTU) (5.00%) strengthens the portfolio with its foothold in coal and energy transition materials, while Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) (4.91%) and Alcoa (AA) (4.70%) bring deep exposure to U.S. steel and aluminum output. The mix continues with Hecla Mining (HL) (4.58%), MP Materials (MP) (4.55%), Warrior Met Coal (HCC) (4.39%), and Steel Dynamics (STLD) (4.38%), all major contributors to America’s resurgent industrial engine.

The fund is valued at around $3.35 billion in assets, with its price at $100.32, a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 76.32%, and a 52‑week rise of 50.99% as of Oct. 20.

It maintains a modest annual dividend yield of 0.32% and a management fee of 0.35%, making it relatively cost-effective for its category. The ETF’s liquidity is also notable, with 3.46 million shares traded this month, up sharply from 1.97 million the month before. That’s a 76.07% increase, evidence that it has become a highly active fund amid renewed confidence in the metals space.

Domestic Metals Renaissance Supports XME’s Growth

One of the clearest catalysts supporting the rise of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF has been the impact of newly enacted U.S. tariffs on imported metals, which have reshaped the market’s supply dynamics and pricing power.

In the latest quarter, the U.S. expanded tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and finished metal products, aiming to safeguard domestic manufacturing and fortify key supply chains. These moves have pushed domestic prices higher, tightened global supply flows, and raised profitability expectations for U.S. producers, a dynamic that directly reinforces XME’s underlying index exposure.

That policy tailwind has coincided with a powerful lift in the broader metals complex. The industrial surge in silver, now trading around $52.24, marks its strongest level. Demand continues to scale with global renewable-energy buildouts, where silver’s use in solar panels and high-efficiency circuitry has made it almost indispensable.

Momentum doesn’t stop there. Gold’s recent run has earned the nickname “golden quarter,” rallying to roughly $4,124.30 per ounce. This strength stems from robust central bank accumulation and investors’ renewed appetite for stability amid an uncertain inflation path.

Conclusion

So, is XME really stepping into the spotlight the Magnificent 7 once owned? All signs suggest that it is. With tariffs pushing domestic metal prices higher, industrial demand for silver and copper holding firm, and gold and aluminum showing sustained strength, the fund’s rally seems rooted in real economic momentum, not speculation. Even if short-term pullbacks emerge, like today's 6.5% drop, the tone across the metals market remains visibly bullish. Unless demand cools sharply, XME’s trajectory still leans upward, a reminder that in 2025, hard assets are calling the market’s tune.",Yahoo!
