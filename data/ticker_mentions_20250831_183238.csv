AAPL,1n4prbw,investing,Confused about reallocating wealth managed individual stock portfolio – need advice,"Hi,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my investment strategy. I’d appreciate your perspective on whether to stay the course or reallocate.

**Current situation:**

* No debt, in between $500k and $1mil in annual income, recently received \~$200k and am now reconsidering my investment strategies (or lack thereof).
* \~$700k in a Citi wealth management brokerage account (a mix of individual stocks, not index funds). High AUM fee of 1%.
* The \~$200k in cash is sitting in a high-yield savings account
* Time horizon: 10 years, want to retire early
* Risk tolerance: high / aggressive. Will probably work to the extent I need if my portfolio is too low to retire in 5-10 years, so I think it's fine to remain aggressive with my time horizon.

**Concerns:**

* My brokerage account has grown since 2022, but I realized I would have done better just buying an S&P 500 index fund. I initially chose a wealth management account in 2022 when I graduated college and started working because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle a market downturn on my own. I'm not worried about that anymore.
* I don’t love holding so many individual stocks; it's going to be a nightmare to handle and I don't have time to do market research. But reallocating means paying capital gains tax.

**My plan for what to do before I drafted this up:**

* I just emailed my advisor and requested a call to move my holdings out and close the account. He's underperformed the S&P and the fee is unnecessary. I just am not sure about what to actually do with the holdings:
   * For the \~680k in equities: ???
      * Like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth reallocating and eating the capital gains taxes, but I'm stressed about having to manage all these individual stocks (see **Portfolio snapshot**)
       * Was going to just kill the ~20k in fixed income when I can
   * For the 200k sign-on bonus: easier situation. Planning to dollar cost average (over 8 weekly installments??) into mostly VOO and a bit of VT, thinking 95/5 or 90/10 split.

**Questions for you all:**

1. I’m unsure whether to:
   1. Keep the current portfolio “as is” (and maybe just move the $200k cash into index funds),
   2. Pick out some of these stocks to sell and convert into index funds
   3. Something hopefully smarter than either of those??
2. How would you approach reallocating from individual stocks to index funds in a tax-efficient way?
3. For the $200k cash, would you lump-sum into an index fund now or dollar-cost average over a few months?
4. If reallocating the $600k, what’s a smart time frame (all at once vs. over years)?

I know nobody can time the market or predict taxes perfectly, but I’d love to hear how more experienced investors would handle this situation. I’m aware I’m privileged to be in this position and want to make the smartest long-term choices possible.

Thanks in advance!

AAPL,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)

	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts.

GOOGL,1n43n2j,wallstreetbets,"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",644,2025-08-30 22:54:27,2025-08-31 18:32:17.244797

>“TSLA isn’t trading on fundamentals – it’s being actively manipulated through the options market,” Johnson wrote on X. “Despite abysmal news, the stock is flat. Why? Someone is aggressively buying calls.”

>Johnson cited data showing Tesla’s put-to-call ratio collapsed from 0.85x to 0.67x in a single day, indicating increased bullish options activity. Tesla closed at $333.87, down 3.50% on Friday.  
Current options metrics show Tesla’s volume ratio at 0.61, suggesting more call options than puts are being traded. The implied volatility stands at 44.88%, above the historic volatility of 40.95%.

>Johnson’s analysis referenced trading data showing Tesla’s stock price movement from approximately $160 to peaks near $480, with recent stabilization around $320-350. The company maintains a market cap of $1.05 trillion with a price to earnings ratio of 193.51.

AMZN,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)

	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts.

NVDA,1n4dcsn,wallstreetbets,“$HE -the boring monopoly in the middle of the ocean that’s about to not be so boring”,"Alright you smooth brained degenerates, let me give you the pitch. I’ve been trading $HE (Hawaiian Electric) almost exclusively for the last couple years. It’s not sexy like NVDA, but it’s been my favorite slot machine for collecting premiums writing puts/calls while slowly stacking shares.

Yes, this is the same company whose market cap got slaughtered when people thought they were about to get sued into oblivion over the Maui fires. That litigation has since been settled. It’s literally a monopoly utility in the middle of the ocean. People can’t exactly shop around for electricity out there. I like the stock.

For the past year, it’s been sideways chop city. Nice and flat, easy for me to milk option premiums. But here’s the thing: something is changing.
	•	Since last earnings, volume has been creeping up steadily.
	•	The stock has quietly been making higher highs + higher lows (classic bullish setup).
	•	Call volume is juicy across all strikes – even way OTM covered calls are getting eaten alive.
	•	Premiums are waking up but still cheap compared to the move that feels like it’s brewing.
	•	Chart is sitting at strong support and looks primed for a run.

I stopped writing covered calls and loaded calls instead. Maybe it’s insiders. Maybe it’s just the natural cycle after a year of consolidation. But the tape looks fishy in a bullish way.

Where could it go? $15 looks like a given, $18 feels likely, and dare I say $20 isn’t out of the question if this thing really rips. I’m not here to sell you hopium, just pointing out that the stock is waking up after hibernating. 

I’m long, I’m loaded, and I’m posting this because I know you degenerates like a clean setup with asymmetric risk/reward.

Not financial advice, but if you want a utility stonk with a little spice, $HE might be it.",204,2025-08-31 05:39:16,2025-08-31 18:32:24.164550
NVDA,1n4prbw,investing,Confused about reallocating wealth managed individual stock portfolio – need advice,"Hi,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my investment strategy. I’d appreciate your perspective on whether to stay the course or reallocate.

**Current situation:**

* No debt, in between $500k and $1mil in annual income, recently received \~$200k and am now reconsidering my investment strategies (or lack thereof).
* \~$700k in a Citi wealth management brokerage account (a mix of individual stocks, not index funds). High AUM fee of 1%.
* The \~$200k in cash is sitting in a high-yield savings account
* Time horizon: 10 years, want to retire early
* Risk tolerance: high / aggressive. Will probably work to the extent I need if my portfolio is too low to retire in 5-10 years, so I think it's fine to remain aggressive with my time horizon.

**Concerns:**

* My brokerage account has grown since 2022, but I realized I would have done better just buying an S&P 500 index fund. I initially chose a wealth management account in 2022 when I graduated college and started working because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle a market downturn on my own. I'm not worried about that anymore.
* I don’t love holding so many individual stocks; it's going to be a nightmare to handle and I don't have time to do market research. But reallocating means paying capital gains tax.

**My plan for what to do before I drafted this up:**

* I just emailed my advisor and requested a call to move my holdings out and close the account. He's underperformed the S&P and the fee is unnecessary. I just am not sure about what to actually do with the holdings:
   * For the \~680k in equities: ???
      * Like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth reallocating and eating the capital gains taxes, but I'm stressed about having to manage all these individual stocks (see **Portfolio snapshot**)
       * Was going to just kill the ~20k in fixed income when I can
   * For the 200k sign-on bonus: easier situation. Planning to dollar cost average (over 8 weekly installments??) into mostly VOO and a bit of VT, thinking 95/5 or 90/10 split.

**Questions for you all:**

1. I’m unsure whether to:
   1. Keep the current portfolio “as is” (and maybe just move the $200k cash into index funds),
   2. Pick out some of these stocks to sell and convert into index funds
   3. Something hopefully smarter than either of those??
2. How would you approach reallocating from individual stocks to index funds in a tax-efficient way?
3. For the $200k cash, would you lump-sum into an index fund now or dollar-cost average over a few months?
4. If reallocating the $600k, what’s a smart time frame (all at once vs. over years)?

I know nobody can time the market or predict taxes perfectly, but I’d love to hear how more experienced investors would handle this situation. I’m aware I’m privileged to be in this position and want to make the smartest long-term choices possible.

Thanks in advance!

META,1n43n2j,wallstreetbets,"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",640,2025-08-30 22:54:27,2025-08-31 18:32:25.702324

META,1n4prbw,investing,Confused about reallocating wealth managed individual stock portfolio – need advice,"Hi,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my investment strategy. I’d appreciate your perspective on whether to stay the course or reallocate.

**Current situation:**

* No debt, in between $500k and $1mil in annual income, recently received \~$200k and am now reconsidering my investment strategies (or lack thereof).
* \~$700k in a Citi wealth management brokerage account (a mix of individual stocks, not index funds). High AUM fee of 1%.
* The \~$200k in cash is sitting in a high-yield savings account
* Time horizon: 10 years, want to retire early
* Risk tolerance: high / aggressive. Will probably work to the extent I need if my portfolio is too low to retire in 5-10 years, so I think it's fine to remain aggressive with my time horizon.

**Concerns:**

* My brokerage account has grown since 2022, but I realized I would have done better just buying an S&P 500 index fund. I initially chose a wealth management account in 2022 when I graduated college and started working because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle a market downturn on my own. I'm not worried about that anymore.
* I don’t love holding so many individual stocks; it's going to be a nightmare to handle and I don't have time to do market research. But reallocating means paying capital gains tax.

**My plan for what to do before I drafted this up:**

* I just emailed my advisor and requested a call to move my holdings out and close the account. He's underperformed the S&P and the fee is unnecessary. I just am not sure about what to actually do with the holdings:
   * For the \~680k in equities: ???
      * Like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth reallocating and eating the capital gains taxes, but I'm stressed about having to manage all these individual stocks (see **Portfolio snapshot**)
       * Was going to just kill the ~20k in fixed income when I can
   * For the 200k sign-on bonus: easier situation. Planning to dollar cost average (over 8 weekly installments??) into mostly VOO and a bit of VT, thinking 95/5 or 90/10 split.

**Questions for you all:**

1. I’m unsure whether to:
   1. Keep the current portfolio “as is” (and maybe just move the $200k cash into index funds),
   2. Pick out some of these stocks to sell and convert into index funds
   3. Something hopefully smarter than either of those??
2. How would you approach reallocating from individual stocks to index funds in a tax-efficient way?
3. For the $200k cash, would you lump-sum into an index fund now or dollar-cost average over a few months?
4. If reallocating the $600k, what’s a smart time frame (all at once vs. over years)?

I know nobody can time the market or predict taxes perfectly, but I’d love to hear how more experienced investors would handle this situation. I’m aware I’m privileged to be in this position and want to make the smartest long-term choices possible.

Thanks in advance!

NFLX,1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)
	•	GOOG – +$274.54 (+83.55%)
	•	AAPL – +$59.88 (+79.60%)
	•	MAR – +$39.44 (+75.69%)
	•	AMZN – +$75.66 (+66.14%)
	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts. 

Edit: Hilarious to me that this got flagged as misleading or unverified. I literally tried to post the image of the account with the same info above but this sub wouldn’t let me attach images. ",1737,2025-08-31 01:26:38,2025-08-31 18:32:27.949798
