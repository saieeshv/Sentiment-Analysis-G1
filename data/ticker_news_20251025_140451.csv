However, recent sales figures reveal mixed performance across regions with North Sea sales significantly up but Kurdistan down.

AAPL,"Mutual funds double stake in Paytm shares in just 6 quarters, but retail investors flee. Who's smart?",Technology,"Synopsis

Indian mutual funds have more than doubled their stake in One97 Communications, Paytm’s parent, rising to 16.25% in September 2025 from 6.8% in June 2024, while retail investors trimmed holdings for the sixth consecutive quarter. The shift reflects renewed institutional confidence as Paytm’s stock more than doubled from record lows of Rs 609 in February 2024 to near Rs 1,300.

Indian mutual funds have more than doubled their stake in One97 Communications, the parent of payments giant Paytm, over the last six quarters, contrasting with a steady retail investor exit. Data from the September 2025 quarter shows mutual fund ownership rising to 16.25%, up from 6.8% in June 2024, according to the latest BSE shareholding pattern.

Retail investors, meanwhile, have continued to trim exposure for the sixth consecutive quarter. Paytm’s retail shareholding fell to 9.07% in September 2025, from 9.73% in June and 12.05% in March 2024. In June 2024, retail holding was over 14%, BSE data showed.

The shift in shareholding coincides with Paytm’s remarkable stock comeback from record lows, attracting renewed institutional confidence after regulatory pressures drove the stock down to Rs 609 in February 2024. In just 20 months, the stock has more than doubled, trading near Rs 1,300.

What’s driving institutional optimism?

Brokerages believe Paytm’s omnichannel presence in merchant payments and improving profitability metrics are key drivers of mutual funds’ bullish stance. According to Axis Capital, Paytm operates one of India’s largest offline merchant networks, with around 13 million devices — including soundboxes and electronic data capture (EDC) machines — across small and large enterprises. It is also among the top four online payment aggregators by gross merchandise value (GMV).

As merchant relationships mature, analysts see potential for monetization through cross-selling lending products or price hikes on devices and services. Axis Capital noted that Paytm’s pilot project to raise soundbox subscription fees from Rs 100 to Rs 129 has shown encouraging results.

Live Events

“Large merchant payment players are entering a strong earnings expansion phase,” the brokerage said in its October 15 report. “Paytm is well positioned with its omnichannel presence and high-vintage merchant relationships.”

The firm expects a healthy pricing environment and margin improvement as the UPI mix stabilizes and credit-linked products gain traction. Regulatory clarity — including payment aggregator norms, merchant KYC, and the default loss guarantee (DLG) model — has further boosted investor confidence.

Axis Capital has raised its FY27–28 EBITDA estimates by 33–46%, citing improved payment margins, scaling of financial services, and tighter operating costs. It upgraded the stock to a ‘buy’ with a target price of Rs 1,500, valuing it at roughly 41 times FY28 estimated EV/EBITDA, while cautioning that deterioration in lending asset quality remains a key risk.

Regulatory tailwinds return

JM Financial highlighted that the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) in-principle approval for Paytm Payments Services Ltd. (PPSL) to operate as an online payment aggregator marks a significant regulatory breakthrough. The nod lifts the ban imposed in November 2022 on onboarding new merchants, which had weighed on investor sentiment.

The brokerage noted that the approval indicates RBI satisfaction with Paytm’s compliance measures and shareholding structure, enhancing the likelihood of eventual approval for the company’s wallet business under Paytm Payments Bank Ltd. (PPBL). The regulatory clarity has helped restore confidence among institutional investors, who had been cautious since the RBI’s early-2024 crackdown that halted fresh deposits and wallet top-ups over repeated compliance lapses.

Cautious optimism remains as analysts warn that competition and technology risks persist. Paytm’s revenue is primarily driven by its online platform, which requires minimal capital expenditure, but India’s rapidly growing fintech market attracts global players who could sustain long-term competition and trigger price wars.

The company’s success hinges on scaling its technology infrastructure to support a growing user base on app and web platforms. Any service disruptions, technical glitches, or cyberattacks could hurt demand, processing efficiency, and customer trust.

Despite these risks, Paytm shares have surged over 70% in a year and roughly 45% in the last six months, reflecting renewed investor optimism.

AAPL,BSE shares rally 15% in a month. Is this the start of a new bull run or just a technical rebound?,Technology,"Synopsis

After weeks of regulatory uncertainty, BSE shares have rebounded sharply, rising 15% in a month as fears over the weekly expiry rule eased. On Thursday, the stock climbed nearly 2% to Rs 2,533.70 before settling at Rs 2,486.50. Renewed stability has sparked buying in market infrastructure stocks, highlighting a measured recovery rather than a purely relief-driven bounce.

After weeks of anxiety over regulatory reforms, BSE’s stock has rebounded sharply. Shares have gained 15% in a month as concerns over the weekly expiry rule faded and traders returned. On Thursday, the stock jumped nearly 2% to Rs 2,533.70 before settling at Rs 2,486.50, extending a rebound that has put the spotlight on whether the rally is sustainable or simply a relief-driven bounce.

Earlier last month, BSE shares had faced pressure amid speculation that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) might scrap or modify the weekly options expiry — a move that could have hurt derivatives volumes and exchange revenues. However, with fresh reports indicating that no immediate changes are planned, traders are betting on stability. The easing of this overhang has sparked renewed buying in market infrastructure stocks like BSE and Angel One.

Further upside, but resistance ahead?

Technically, the rally looks firm. BSE’s stock is trading above all eight major simple moving averages, from the 5-day to the 200-day mark, indicating bullish momentum across timeframes. The Relative Strength Index stands at 66.9, signaling healthy momentum, while the MACD continues to hover above its signal line, reinforcing the positive setup.

Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research at Religare Broking, said, “BSE has recently witnessed a strong rebound from its 200-day moving average, supported by a breakout above the descending trendline, signaling a potential trend reversal.” He said the stock is approaching a crucial resistance zone near Rs 2,580–2,600, where profit booking could emerge, and sustained closing above this level can open the next upside target toward Rs 2,720–2,850.

Live Events

Similarly, Kunal V Parar, VP of Technical Research and Algo at Choice Broking, said the stock has been trading above its 100-day Moving Average for the past week, ""indicating a positive trend in the counter. Furthermore, it has recently taken support near its 200-day Moving Average, suggesting a strong rebound from lower levels.""

Parar said that the “Rs 2000 zone, which earlier acted as a key resistance, has now turned into a strong support level,” and sees a “potential upside move towards Rs 2,690-3,000, with a strict stop loss at Rs 2,250.”

Fundamentals stay strong

Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said, “Based on current earnings visibility and steady derivative turnover, my near-term target range is Rs 2,650–2,750.” He noted that the stock “remains supported by strong operational cash flows, zero debt, and healthy return ratios.”

Dasani added, “BSE’s fundamentals remain robust, backed by a debt-free balance sheet and strong return on equity.” He highlighted that earlier concerns over weekly expiry adjustments have eased, as recent trading data shows limited impact on turnover.

The INVasset PMS head expects that sustained traction in F&O and transaction revenue could push the stock toward Rs 2,800 in the medium term, but cautioned that “the sustainability of the current rally will depend on continued growth in derivative contracts and stable regulatory clarity.”

Sector momentum and macro tailwinds

Exchange stocks like BSE have benefited from the broader rally in India’s capital markets. The Sensex climbed to 85,272.40 on Thursday, less than 1% off its all-time high, supported by optimism over India–U.S. trade negotiations and strong domestic demand. Progress on trade talks, which could cut U.S. tariffs on Indian exports from around 50% to 15–16%, has bolstered sentiment.

“Exchange stocks like BSE are closely tied to domestic trading activity, F&O participation, and FII flows,” said Harshal Dasani. “Rising retail participation and deepening derivatives markets provide a structural tailwind.”

For now, the comeback in BSE shares appears less like a speculative bounce and more like a measured recovery, driven by easing regulatory fears and solid fundamentals. With the stock nearing a key resistance zone and markets approaching record highs, investors are watching closely to see whether the rally has more legs or if a short-term pause is likely.

AAPL,Analysis-Investors use dotcom era playbook to dodge AI bubble risks,Technology,"In this article:

By Naomi Rovnick

LONDON (Reuters) -Major investors, spooked by AI exuberance yet wary of betting against it, are shifting from hyped-up stocks into potential next-in-line winners, reviving a strategy from the 1990s dotcom era that helped some sidestep the crash.

As U.S. stocks have hit successive records and AI chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) valuation has surged beyond $4 trillion, professional investors have been trying to find ways to make money from the bull market while avoiding excessive risk.

Some are looking back to the 1990s internet boom, which spread from startups to telecoms and tech, and where hedge funds rode the wave by flipping out of highly-valued stocks before they peaked and picking others that had room to rise.

""What we are doing is what worked from 1998 to 2000,"" said Francesco Sandrini, multi-asset head and Italy CIO at Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi.

He highlighted signs of irrational exuberance on Wall Street, such as frenzied trading in risky options pegged to the share prices of big AI stocks. But he said he expected the new tech enthusiasm to continue and hoped to bank gains via bets on reasonably valued assets that might rally next.

Sandrini said this involved trying to find ""the highest growth opportunities that so far the market had failed to spot"", with moves into software groups, robotics and Asian tech.

Other investors also expected to edge out of Wall Street's Magnificent Seven stocks after shares in Nvidia more than tripled in two years, but want to keep their diversification within the AI sphere.

ASSET MANAGERS NEED TO BE NIMBLE TO RIDE THE WAVE

""The odds of this (AI boom) being a bust are very high because you've got companies spending trillions and all fighting for the same market that does not yet exist,"" said Goshawk Asset Management CIO Simon Edelsten, who worked on telecom IPOs at stockbroker Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London in 1999.

He expected the next phase of AI fever to spread from Nvidia and others like Microsoft and Alphabet into related sectors.

Timing the phases of a bubble has historically been a way to play it without the risk of trying to call the peak too early.

A study by economists Markus Brunnermeir and Stefan Nagel showed that hedge funds mostly did not bet against the dotcom bubble, but rode it skillfully enough to beat the market by about 4.5% per quarter from 1998-2000 and avoid the worst of the downturn.

They shed high-priced internet stocks in time to recycle profits into others before they caught the attention of less sophisticated investors.

""There were good profits to be made for the fleet of foot even during 2000 when the top came,"" Edelsten at Goshawk said, adding the current market environment was similar to 1999.

He favoured IT consultants and Japanese robotics groups that can potentially pick up revenues from AI heavyweights, in what he said was the typical chronology of a market gold rush.

""When someone strikes gold, (you) buy the local hardware store where the prospectors will buy all their shovels.""

INVESTORS TRY TO STAY IN AI WITHOUT EXCESSIVE RISK

Investors are also attempting to benefit from the trillions of dollars so-called hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are committing to AI data centres and advanced chips without taking on more direct exposure to these companies.

Fidelity International multi-asset manager Becky Qin said uranium was her favoured new AI trade because power-hungry AI data centres could gobble up nuclear energy.

Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at asset manager Carmignac, was taking profits on Magnificent Seven stocks and building up a position in Taiwan's Gudeng Precision, which makes delivery boxes for AI chipmakers including TSMC.

Asset managers are also concerned that the rush to build data centres could result in overcapacity, as in the fiber-optic cable boom in the telecoms industry.

""In any new technological paradigm we don't get from A to B without excesses along the way,"" said Pictet Asset Management senior multi-asset strategist Arun Sai.

Even though top AI stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are being powered by strong earnings, he still sees ""the building blocks of a bubble"" and favours Chinese stocks as a hedge if rapid AI advancements in China sap Wall Street's AI enthusiasm.

Some investors, though, do not favour this relative value approach to AI investing as a way to mitigate future losses.

Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said he was hedging his U.S. tech positions with European and healthcare assets lest an AI stock crash takes the U.S. economy down with it.

He said it was impossible to forecast how long the AI craze would roll on because calling the peak was usually only possible with hindsight.

""We're in 1999 until the bubble pops.""

AAPL,"HUL shares decline 5% as brokerages turn cautious post Q2 show. Should you buy, sell or hold?",Technology,"Synopsis

HUL shares fell after Q2 FY26 net profit rose 3.6% to Rs 2,685 crore, mainly due to a one-off tax gain, while brokers flagged margin pressures and subdued operational performance.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) slipped 4.8% in early trade on Friday, October 24, to their day’s low of Rs 2,475.20 on the BSE after the FMCG major reported a 3.6% year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the September quarter, following which, brokerage firms turned cautious on the stock, stating concerns over margin pressure.

The Q2 FY26 performance, though modestly positive, came against the backdrop of a one-off tax gain, while operational performance remained subdued due to GST-led transitions.

HUL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,685 crore for Q2 FY26, compared to Rs 2,591 crore in the year-ago period. The company attributed the increase in profit primarily to a one-time exceptional gain of Rs 273 crore, resulting from the resolution of historical tax matters between UK and Indian authorities.

Without this one-off gain, the core profitability saw limited expansion. HUL’s revenue rose 0.6% year-on-year, while EBITDA margins declined 90 basis points to 23%, impacted by GST-related price cuts across a significant portion of its portfolio.

Here’s what brokerage firms are saying:

Live Events

Goldman Sachs: Buy| Target price: Rs 2,850

Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on HUL but lowered its target price to Rs 2,850 from Rs 2,900. The brokerage highlighted that revenue rose 0.6% YoY, while EBITDA declined 2.3%, with margins at 23.1%, slightly below their estimate of 23.4%. The firm noted that the GST cut on 40% of HUL’s portfolio led to price reductions in approximately 1,200 SKUs, triggering short-term destocking. While Goldman Sachs expects a recovery in Q3FY26, it noted the rebound could be slower than earlier anticipated. It also cut FY26–28 EPS estimates by 2–3%, projecting EBITDA margins to remain between 22–23% in the second half of FY26.

Nuvama: Buy| Target price: Rs 3,200

Nuvama retained its ‘Buy’ rating and raised its target price to Rs 3,240 from Rs 3,200, despite acknowledging short-term headwinds. The firm expects HUL’s EBITDA margins to rise by 50–60 basis points in Q3 post the demerger of its ice-cream business, with steady guidance maintained at 22–23%. Nuvama attributed a 2% volume impact in Q2 to the GST-led transition but sees trade normalisation from November onwards aiding a stronger H2 performance. The brokerage anticipates H2FY26 to outpace the first half in terms of recovery.

Citi: Buy| Target price: Rs 3,000

Citi also maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,000 (vs Rs 2,900 earlier). It said HUL’s Q2 results were slightly ahead of expectations, with revenue growing 2% and EBITDA margin at the higher end of guidance at 23%. Citi attributed quarterly softness to temporary de-stocking due to GST rate anticipation, estimating a 200 bps impact. It expects normal trading to resume by early November. The brokerage noted strong volume performance in home care, skin care and colour cosmetics, while other categories like tea, hair care, and oral care faced GST-related challenges. Citi projected 8–9% revenue/EPS CAGR for FY25–28 and made only marginal earnings tweaks (<1%).

Elara: Accumulate| Target price: Rs 2,780

Elara Capital maintained an ‘Accumulate’ rating on HUL and set a target price of Rs 2,780. The firm remains cautiously optimistic, supported by a favourable macro environment and volume-led growth strategies. Elara flagged rural recovery as a key variable, while acknowledging that GST disruption may persist into October. It expects recovery from early November to boost second-half growth. While the firm retained its EBITDA margin guidance at 22–23%, it noted a 90 bps year-on-year decline in Q2 margins to 23%, though still 40 bps ahead of estimates. Elara expects the ice-cream demerger to add a further 50–60 bps to margin in upcoming quarters.

AAPL,Laurus Labs shares tumble 4% despite 886% surge in Q2 PAT. Should you buy the dip?,Technology,"Synopsis

Laurus Labs shares fell despite Q2FY26 PAT surging 886% to Rs 195 crore, revenue rising 35%, and EBITDA more than doubling, with margins expanding to 24.4%.

Shares of Laurus Labs fell 3.7% to their day’s low of Rs 901.85 on Friday, October 24, even after the company announced a sharp surge in its Q2FY26 earnings. The pharmaceutical firm reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 195 crore, marking an 885.7% year-on-year (YoY) increase from Rs 19.8 crore in Q2FY25.

Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 1,653.5 crore, up 35.1% from Rs 1,223.7 crore in the same period last year. Operating performance was also strong, with EBITDA more than doubling to Rs 403.3 crore from Rs 178.3 crore, reflecting a YoY growth of 126.2%. The EBITDA margin expanded by 980 basis points to 24.4%, signalling improved operational efficiency.

After the Q2 results, here are what brokerage firms are saying:

Goldman Sachs: Sell| Target price: Rs

Goldman Sachs has reiterated its ""Sell"" rating on Laurus Labs, while revising the target price upward to Rs 775 from Rs 750. The brokerage highlighted that the company posted a 35% year-on-year (YoY) increase in sales and a 126% surge in EBITDA, primarily driven by strong growth in the Generic Finished Dosage Forms (FDF) segment, which grew 32% excluding government supply engagements (GSe).

Laurus Labs reported margins at 24.4%, supported by a better product mix and enhanced operating leverage. The Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation (CDMO) business grew 53% YoY, attributed to late-stage new chemical entity (NCE) momentum and additional manufacturing assets. Meanwhile, the generics FDF business saw a robust 58% YoY rise, with growth being led by the non-antiretroviral segment, expected to contribute significantly in the second half of FY26.

Live Events

The company’s 400KL Vizag manufacturing facility is scheduled for completion by the end of 2026. Additionally, Laurus Labs has outlined a Rs 5,000 crore capital expenditure plan over five years, focusing on CDMO, biologics, and generics. Although Goldman Sachs upgraded Laurus Labs’ FY27E earnings per share (EPS) by 2–12%, it noted concerns around valuation, viewing the stock as expensive at 54x FY27E price-to-earnings.

Motilal Oswal: Buy| Target price: Rs 1,110

Motilal Oswal has reiterated a “Buy” rating on Laurus Labs with a target price of Rs 1,110, citing a better-than-expected Q2 FY26 performance. The brokerage noted a 6%, 18%, and 38% beat on revenue, EBITDA, and PAT, respectively, driven by higher formulation sales backed by robust ARV revenues, superior mix in the CDMO segment, and improved operating leverage.

The firm highlighted strong traction in the human health CDMO segment and ongoing investments in manufacturing assets for animal health and crop science applications, with validation batches likely to scale up by FY27. Encouraging performance was also seen in the non-ARV formulation segment, which witnessed healthy sequential growth led by new product introductions and higher off-take. ARV volumes also remained strong.

Motilal Oswal raised its earnings estimates for Laurus Labs by 11%, 10%, and 6% for FY26, FY27, and FY28, respectively, factoring in improved ARV prospects, CDMO project pick-up, and higher generics demand. The brokerage expects a 50% earnings CAGR over FY25–28 and values the stock at 58x FY27E P/E.

Choice Broking: Buy| Target price: Rs 1,085

Choice Broking maintains a ""Buy"" rating on Laurus Labs with a target price of Rs 1,085, citing the company's strategic evolution from a traditional generics player to a CDMO (Synthesis)-led model. The brokerage expects the CDMO segment to contribute over 30% to revenues in the medium term.

Margins are projected to expand to the 23–25% range, driven by a favourable product mix, the high-margin nature of the CDMO business, and benefits from ramping up of new manufacturing assets.

Choice Broking has slightly raised its earnings estimates by 0.9% for FY26 and 5.6% for FY27, while valuing Laurus at 50x FY27-28 EPS, consistent with prior estimates. The firm believes the valuation is justified given better growth visibility, improving margins, and healthy return ratios. A PEG ratio of 0.94 also supports this valuation approach.

AAPL,"Sensex slips over 100 pts, Nifty below 25,900 as doubts cloud US-India trade deal",Technology,"Synopsis

Indian stock markets opened on a subdued note this Friday. The Sensex and Nifty saw a slight dip after reaching near record highs. The rally from Thursday lost momentum as optimism about a US-India trade deal waned. The Indian government did not confirm reports of an imminent agreement. Markets are now awaiting further developments.

Indian stocks traded lower on Friday, with the Sensex and Nifty retreating slightly after hovering near record highs in the previous session. The rally that gathered pace on Thursday lost steam midway and reversed in the final hour as optimism over a potential US-India trade deal faded when the Indian government refrained from confirming reports of an imminent deal.

The S&P BSE Sensex fell 106.67 points, or 0.13%, to trade at 84,449.73, while the NSE Nifty 50 slipped 26.70 points, or 0.1%, to start at 25,864.70.

On the 30-share Sensex, Hindustan Unilever, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Power Grid, and Titan led the declines, falling between 0.5% and 5%.

Among sectors, the Nifty FMCG index was the biggest drag, down 1.3%, while the Nifty Pharma index slipped 0.7%.

Broader markets were subdued, with both midcap and smallcap stocks trading flat.

Live Events

Colgate-Palmolive (India) shares dropped nearly 4% after the company posted a 17% year-on-year decline in net profit for the September quarter. Hindustan Unilever shares slid almost 5% even as the FMCG major reported a 3.6% rise in consolidated net profit for the same period, as brokerages turned cautious on the stock citing margin pressures.

Expert views

Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market rally that began strongly on Thursday lost steam midway and ""completely fizzled out during the last hour"" after the Indian government did not confirm reports of an imminent US-India trade deal. ""This dampened the spirits of the bulls who couldn't force further short covering,"" he said.

Vijayakumar noted, however, that the commerce minister's comment that ""we hope to work towards a fair and equitable agreement with the US"" suggested the ongoing rally could stay intact. Vijayakumar also pointed out that a U.S.-China trade deal ""is likely in the coming summit between the top leaders from both sides,"" adding that the U.S. may have to soften its stance given China's leverage in rare earth minerals and magnets.

According to Vijayakumar, with the number of short positions in the system coming down, ""a strong short-covering rally, which can take the market up significantly, is unlikely.""

Global Markets

Asian shares climbed on Friday, lifted by strong Wall Street earnings and signs of easing U.S.-China tensions, while crude prices pared gains after new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil suppliers.

Intel's quarterly results topped expectations, adding to a string of positive U.S. earnings. Japan's Nikkei surged 1.2% ahead of a speech by the new prime minister, expected to outline stimulus measures. MSCI's Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 0.5% in early trade.

Investor focus is on Friday's U.S. consumer price data for clues ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting, with attention heightened as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown limits broader economic releases. Optimism was bolstered after the White House confirmed that President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week, as a tariff deadline approaches.

In commodities and crypto, bitcoin gained 0.8% to $110,512.30, ether rose 1.2% to $3,878.01, and spot gold ticked up 0.3% to $4,138.52 per ounce, though it remains set for its worst week since May.

FII/DII Tracker

On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth a little over Rs 1,166 crore on October 23, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 3,894 crore.

Crude impact

Oil prices eased in early trade on Friday, giving back part of Thursday’s rally but remaining poised for a weekly advance, as fresh U.S. sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies stoked supply concerns over the Ukraine conflict.

Brent crude futures fell 36 cents, or 0.55%, to $65.63 a barrel at 0333 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dipped 33 cents, or 0.58%, to $61.43.

Rupee vs Dollar

The Indian rupee jumped 9 paise to 87.79 against the U.S. dollar in early Friday trade, supported by a decline in global crude prices and optimism over a potential India-US trade deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index, tracking the greenback against a basket of currencies, inched up 0.1% to 99.

Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Vinovest

Vinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine — a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades. With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo Idle Cash

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi Alt Investments

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Range Wealth Management

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

American Hartford Gold

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

AAPL,"Alaska Airlines Hit By Major IT Outage, Causing Widespread Flight Delays",Technology,"Travelers across the US are experiencing significant flight delays as Alaska Airlines struggles with a widespread IT system failure that has severely disrupted its operations, according to reports.

Notably, Alaska Air Group Inc. expects its earnings for the final months of the year to come in below its previous estimates after reporting third-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations.

The Seattle-based parent of now-merged Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said third-quarter profit was hurt by a summer IT outgae that temporarily halted flying and by bad weather, stunting its ability to cash in on rebounding demand.

A fresh IT outage again disrupted Alaska operations on Thursday, forcing the carrier to keep planes on the ground nationwide, the company said.

It reported earnings of $1.05 a share on an adjusted diluted basis, below the $1.09 expected on average by analysts polled by Bloomberg.

Shares in Alaska fell nearly 3% in postmarket trading. The stock is down 28% for the year through Thursday’s close.

Consumer confidence has bounced back after a tariff-driven slump and demand for holiday travel is looking strong, Alaska finance executive Ryan St. John said in an interview.

However, an extended US government shutdown poses a risk for some of the carrier’s operations, echoing concerns at other airlines including Southwest Airlines Co., as do volatile fuel costs.

“People wanting to fly — and the willingness to pay to go fly around the holidays — I don’t think a government shutdown is going to change that type of dynamic,” St. John said. “It’s more about just being able to operate more than anything.”

The carrier revised up its 2025 estimate for revenue per seat flown a mile to a growth in the low single digits. Previously the company estimated a range from flat to low single-digit growth.

Non-fuel costs on a seat-mile basis rose 8.6% from a year ago because of elevated recovery costs from a data center outage that hobbled operations in July.

Alaska forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least 40 cents in the fourth quarter and $2.40 for the full year — both below analysts’ expectations. Previously, it saw full-year EPS of higher than $3.25.

Growing preference for premium products continues to outpace the basic economy fares, it said. Revenue from premium fares, which accounts for about 35% of overall revenue, grew 5% in the quarter from a year ago.

Alaska said an uptick in business travel continued throughout the summer. Both Delta Airlines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. also signaled business travel trending positive as corporate confidence rebuilds.

Investors will be eager for the airline’s commentary on its operations and demand when the company hosts an earnings conference call on Friday.",Ndtvprofit.com,2025-10-24T02:11:47Z,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/alaska-airlines-hit-by-major-it-outage-causing-widespread-flight-delays,0.7,2025-10-25 13:39:53.722877,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,Asian stocks open higher as Trump-Xi plan eases nerves,Technology,"Synopsis

Asian stocks rose Friday as a planned meeting between US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping eased trade tensions. Oil prices dipped ahead of US inflation data, with investors anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut next week despite sticky inflation. Resilient earnings and potential positive US-China news support continued equity market optimism.

Asian stocks opened higher Friday as a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping eased nerves around trade tensions. Oil prices edged lower ahead of US inflation data.

An MSCI gauge of Asian shares was up around 0.3% at the open, following a move higher on Wall Street on Thursday. Shares in Intel Corp helped lift the mood, climbing in post-market trading after an upbeat revenue forecast. Treasuries had also snapped a three-day rally overnight as yields rose across the curve, with the 10-year climbing five basis points to 4%.

The moves came after the White House said President Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Oct. 30, a positive development amid a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration is also weighing a quantum-computing boost in an effort to counter China, spurring an industry rally.

The cross-asset moves also reflected optimism that Friday’s inflation reading won’t dent the broad optimism supported by resilient earnings and the potential for supportive news on US-China relations. The dollar was little changed.

“Valuations continue to be the best argument for bears, but the relentless buy-the-dip approach of investors has even the most pessimistic investors questioning their outlook,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.

Live Events

West Texas Intermediate jumped 5.6% to settle near $62 a barrel on Thursday, the most since the start of the Israel-Iran conflict on June 13. The latest US oil sanctions signaled a major policy turn from the Group-of-Seven price cap strategy that sought to limit Russia’s earnings without disrupting supply or driving up global prices.

“As with the trade war, the fallout from the oil sanctions is murky at best, although we expect that from the perspective of the market at least, the kneejerk spike in crude will represent the bulk of the attention devoted to this matter, as it were,” said Ian Lyngen, Vail Hartman and Delaney Choi at BMO Capital Markets.

Investors will likely look past any evidence of stubborn inflation in Friday’s consumer price index report, as money markets brace for a Federal Reserve rate cut next week.

The September CPI report originally slated for Oct. 15 release was delayed due to the US government shutdown. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast the core CPI, which excludes food and fuel, to have climbed 0.3% for a third straight month as higher import duties continue to gradually filter through to consumers. The projected monthly gain will keep the annual core CPI at 3.1%.

Although inflation is stuck above the Fed’s goal, officials are expected to announce their second rate cut of the year because of the fragile labor market.

Friday’s CPI is important in the sense that it’s one of the few economic data points that we will see given the government shutdown, according to Emily Bowersock Hill founding partner of Bowersock Capital Partners.

“But since the Federal Reserve is likely more focused on the labor market, we don’t expect Friday’s CPI to weigh heavily on next week’s Fed decision,” she said. “We will likely see two more rate cuts this year, in October and December.”

Prospects for Fed easing, durable earnings growth and AI investment spending support the view that the equity bull market has further room to run, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management.

While it’s important to have adequate exposure to US stocks, she also believes investors should diversify their portfolios.

“Any setbacks in US-China relations or potential concerns about the durability of the AI-driven rally could trigger bouts of volatility,” she noted.

AAPL,"Intel says server CPUs will be hot again – in a good way, to power AI workloads – any year now",Technology,"Intel has returned to profitability, grown revenue, and suggested demand for AI will ensure its struggling foundry business wins customers and boosts its datacenter CPU business.

Chipzilla advised investors of the above on Thursday when it announced its Q3 FY 2025 results, which saw it win $13.7 billion in revenue – a three point year-over-year jump – and return to profitability with net income of $4.1 billion, a welcome turnaround from Q2’s $2.9 billion of red ink.

The news wasn’t all good, because sales of Intel’s datacenter products fell one percent, and its Foundry business shed four percent of revenue.

Client products led the way with $8.5 billion revenue, up five percent.

“The Windows refresh is happening more significantly than I think we expected,” CFO David Zinsner said on the company’s earnings call, and Intel is therefore doing well on the desktop as buyers shell out for new hardware to run Windows 11 now that Microsoft has ended support for Windows 10.

PCs remain an important market, but all the growth in hardware right now is in AI and Intel has missed the boat there – rivals Nvidia and AMD have cornered the market for GPUs. Intel’s chipmaking Foundry business is also nowhere in AI, because it can’t match TSMC’s manufacturing prowess and is yet to perfect the 18A process that will bring it closer to its Taiwanese rival.

On its earnings call, execs said Intel is addressing those issues.

CEO Lip Bu Tan said Intel “made tremendous good progress … on 18A”, and ticked off the key milestone of fully operationalizing Fab 52, the Arizona facility where it will make silicon wafers for chips built using the process.

But Zinsner cautioned that Intel won’t rush 18A, because it doesn’t want to invest in chipmaking capacity until it has clients, even as it works to satisfy clients that 18A is a safe bet.

“18A, we still have to ramp this,” he said on the company’s earnings call. “I wouldn't expect significant capacity increases in the near term. But I think as we said, we are not at peak supply for 18A. In fact, we don't get there until the end of the decade.”

Execs didn’t directly address the fact that buyers are not confident in 18A – only Microsoft has signed up to build chips on the process – and said Intel is working with customers to give them confidence it should be their foundry of choice. The company is also talking to chip design firms about its next process – named 14A – and said that effort is already more mature than 18A was at the same point in its evolution.

Discussing GPUs, Lip Bu Tan said Intel plans to launch “successive generations of inference-optimized GPUs on the annual cadence that features enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.”

That’s a nod to the fact that analysts believe the market for hardware to run AI workloads – which requires inferencing capabilities – will grow fast and become colossal as more businesses deploy AI-infused applications.

CFO Zinsner also suggested Intel’s server CPU business, which has been its cash cow for years, will also benefit from the AI boom.

“In data center, the accelerating build-out of AI infrastructure is positive for server CPU demand from head nodes, inference, orchestration layers and storage,” he said. “We are cautiously optimistic that the CPU TAM [total addressable market] will continue to grow in 2026 even as we have work to do to improve our competitive position.”

“It is increasingly clear that CPUs play a critical role today, and will going forward within the AI data center as AI usage expands and especially as inference workloads outpace that of training,” the CFO added. “Some data center customers are beginning to ask about longer-term strategic supply agreements to support their business goals due to the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. This dynamic, combined with the underinvestment in traditional infrastructure over the last couple of years should enable the revenue TAM for server CPUs to comfortably grow going forward.”

The company warned not all is rosy: It can’t build enough chips on its existing Intel 7 and Intel 10 processes to meet demand and won’t invest to increase capacity. “In some ways, we're living off of inventory,” Zinsner said. The company is also struggling to secure some chipmaking supplies.

But the company has improved its balance sheet, in part by paying down debt, which means it will have the cash needed to invest.

CEO Tan said Intel is therefore hiring the people it needs to get its chipmaking business into good shape.

The 52-week range of Iron Mountain stock price was $72.33 to $130.24.

Iron Mountain's dividend yield is 3%. It paid $3.17 per share in dividends during the last 12 months.

The company on Aug. 6 announced its Q2 2025 earnings, posting adjusted EPS of $0.48, missing the consensus estimate of $0.50, while revenues of $1.71 billion came in above the consensus of $1.68 billion, as reported by Benzinga.

How Can You Earn $100 Per Month As An Iron Mountain Investor?

If you want to make $100 per month — $1,200 annually — from Iron Mountain dividends, your investment value needs to be $40,000, which is around 378 shares at $105.83 each.

Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables — the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (3% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.3 = $40,000 to generate an income of $100 per month.

You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.

AAPL,Asian Stocks Higher As Trump-Xi Plan Eases Nerves: Markets Wrap,Technology,"US equity futures gained as trade tensions eased and investors stuck to bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts ahead of a key inflation reading later Friday.

Contracts on the S&P 500 were up about 0.3% after a tech-led rally on Wall Street put the benchmark on track for a second weekly gain of more than 1%. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 advanced 0.5%. Shares in Intel Corp soared in pre-market trading in New York after an upbeat revenue forecast. Newmont Corp. slumped after the precious-metals miner’s guidance disappointed investors.

With money markets pricing in a Federal Reserve rate cut next week and Treasuries set for their best monthly performance since February, investors will likely look past any evidence of stubborn inflation in Friday’s consumer price index report, which comes after a more-than-three-week data vacuum due to the US government shutdown. Treasury yields and a gauge of the dollar were steady.

“Whatever the print looks like, it won’t deter the FOMC from delivering a 25 basis-point cut next week, or at the December meeting, even if there will probably be some knee jerk volatility as the data crosses,” said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index erased gains amid mixed earnings and contrasting economic data from Germany and France, the region’s two biggest economies. While business activity in Germany surged, France’s composite purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly fell. The country’s CAC 40 stock index declined.

Among companies reporting earnings in Europe, French drugmaker Sanofi SA, UK lender NatWest Group Plc, Swiss cement producer Holcim AG and Swedish defense firm Saab AB gained after beats. Aluminum supplier Norsk Hydro ASA and Dutch lights manufacturer Signify NV dropped after missing analysts’ estimates.

The strong earnings season so far has helped markets to ride out geopolitical and trade tensions. With nearly quarter of the reporting done, year-on-year growth in earnings-per-share has been 4% in Europe and 14% in the US, better than expected, according to Barclays Plc strategists. The real test will come with big-tech results starting next week, they said. Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are slated to report on Oct. 29 and Apple Inc. the day after.

“We do not think that we are out of the volatility period and market sentiment still feels fragile,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist at Jefferies International Ltd. “Investor positioning has shown some signs of cleanup, but overall positioning still remains on the long side. Thus, we are keeping our low-risk mode for now, while maintaining our medium term bullish view.”

Trade Tensions

Market sentiment was helped by a White House announcement that President Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, a chance for cooler heads to prevail after a recent flare-up in trade tensions. The two leaders will talk next Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to power.

“The confirmation of a Xi–Trump meeting gave markets a clear reason for a relief rally today,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at Vantage Markets in Melbourne. “Not from hopes of warmer U.S.–China relations ahead, but from the perception that any progress is better than stalemate, and that a new deal before the truce deadline now appears more attainable.”

Other trade conflicts continue to simmer, however. Trump halted all tariff negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian advertisement against his signature tariffs plan featuring the voice of former President Ronald Reagan. Canadian bonds fell and the currency weakened.

AAPL,"Stock benchmarks poised to open higher on earnings, trade optimism",Technology,"The stock benchmarks, trading just shy of record levels, are set to open higher on Friday, as hopes around a lowering of global trade tensions and a potential rebound in domestic corporate earnings aided sentiment.

Gift Nifty futures were trading at 26,026 points as of 7:45 a.m. IST, indicating that the benchmark Nifty 50 will open above Thursday's one-year high close of 25,891.4.

Both Nifty and Sensex indexes have gained about 3 per cent in the past six sessions and are trading about 1.5 per cent below record high levels, aided by optimism over an imminent India-US trade deal, robust earnings from key sectoral leaders and sustained festive season demand.

However, analysts said profit-booking across sectors is possible after the strong recent rally, even as the benchmarks inch towards record high levels.

""The recent price action indicates the likelihood of a short-term consolidation phase after the sharp up-move,"" said Ajit Mishra, senior vice-president of research at Religare Broking, adding that ""the Nifty 50 still retains the potential to retest its record highs soon.""

Meanwhile, Indian refiners are poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil to comply with new US sanctions. Other Asian markets opened higher, with the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index rising 0.5%. Wall Street equities closed higher overnight after the White House confirmed US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea next week.

Oil prices eased on the day after a 5 per cent surge in the previous session due to fresh US sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies over the war in Ukraine, which fuelled supply concerns.

Foreign institutional investors turned net sellers of Indian shares on Thursday, with outflows of ₹1,166 crore ($132.7 million). Domestic institutional investors purchased equities worth 38.94 billion rupees, on a net basis.

AAPL,"Wall St ends higher amid mixed earnings, Trump-Xi meeting confirmed",Technology,"Synopsis

On Thursday, Indian markets opened on a high note, buoyed by positive reactions to corporate earnings and global political dynamics. The announcement of a pivotal meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping alleviated concerns over trade disputes. Strong performances from key companies further fueled market optimism, with energy sectors benefiting from a hike in oil prices.

Wall Street advanced on Thursday as investors mulled a mixed batch of corporate earnings and shifting geopolitical concerns.

All three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher, with tech strength nudging the Nasdaq into the lead. But the small-cap Russell 2000 was the clear outperformer. The indexes gained some momentum after the White House confirmed U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week as part of his trip through Asia.

Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating in recent days, marked by tit-for-tat retaliatory measures announced by both sides. Confirmation that the two leaders would meet next week appeared to ease those tensions. Trump announced sanctions against Russian oil companies, marking a sharp policy shift in ramping up the pressure on Moscow over its war against Ukraine, ratcheting up geopolitical strife and sending world oil prices jumping.

""The Trump-Xi confirmation is clearly positive,"" said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That's a good checkpoint for sentiment, which has been really up-and-down on trade and that's obviously playing a role today.""

""Additionally, earnings have been really strong in general,"" Hill added. ""And that's supporting the market from a fundamental perspective.""

Live Events

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 38.77 points, or 0.58%, to end at 6,738.17 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 197.95 points, or 0.87%, to 22,938.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.50 points, or 0.31%, to 46,733.91.

Third-quarter reporting season has hit full stride.

Tesla shares closed higher, reclaiming earlier losses following its third-quarter profit miss. The electric-vehicle maker was the first of the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of megacap momentum stocks that account for more than a third of the S&P 500's market cap.

IBM dropped after reporting a slowdown in its key cloud software segment, eclipsing its earnings beat.

So far, just over a quarter of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported third-quarter results. Of those, 86% have beaten consensus expectations, according to LSEG data.

In aggregate, analysts currently expect S&P 500 third-quarter earnings growth of 9.9% year-on-year, up from their 8.8% growth estimate as of October 1, per LSEG.

In other earnings, health insurer Molina Healthcare plunged after slashing its annual profit forecast.

Honeywell raised its annual profit forecast on strong aerospace demand, sending its stock higher.

American Airlines shares advanced after the carrier raised its annual profit forecast, while Southwest Airlines slipped despite posting a surprise quarterly profit and record current-quarter sales.

T-Mobile dipped even after the telecom's wireless subscriber adds surpassed analyst expectations.

Dow stock surged after the chemical company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss as cost cuts and higher volumes helped offset price weakness.

Quantum computing firms jumped after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration was in talks with several of them to take equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. Energy companies, buoyed by spiking crude prices in the wake of Trump's sanctions on Russian oil, enjoyed the biggest percentage gain among the 11 main sectors of the S&P 500. Oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron ended the session higher.

Valero Energy rose after the independent oil refiner reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits. Rising geopolitical turmoil has benefited aerospace and defense stocks over the past year. The S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index outperformed on the day.

AAPL,NZ sharemarket edges higher as F&P Healthcare weighs on gains - Market Close,Technology,"By late in the New Zealand day, Australia’s S&P/AX 200 index was slightly weaker but not far off 52-week highs.

In the US, the main indices were mixed, the Dow finishing up 0.47%, the S&P 500 ending flat, and the Nasdaq easing 0.16%.

“It’s quiet Friday before the long [Labour] weekend,” Salt Funds managing director Matt Goodson said.

“There is very little market news. That said, there is a bid tone to the market.”

Goodson said the property stocks were starting to emerge from the shadow of Precinct Property’s big capital raise, which saw investors lighten their holdings in some property stocks to participate in the Precinct issue.

Precinct’s $285m placement at $1.23 a share was fully subscribed. The $25m share purchase plan closes on Tuesday.

S&P/NZX Real Estate Select Index gained 30 points or 1.66% to finish at 1839.78.

Air NZ ended flat at 60c despite receiving a couple of broker downgrades after the company announced this week that it expects report a pre-tax first half loss of $30-55m.

Forsyth Barr’s Air NZ rating went to “underperform” from “neutral” on the news.

The broker said the earnings downtrade highlighted the “acute” nature of its current challenges.

Another broker, Jarden, cut its rating on Air NZ to “underweight” from neutral.

“It’s been a remarkably tough period for them, in stark contrast to Qantas, which has gone from strength to strength over the same time, with Air NZ suffering from a mixture of the weak economy and its engine issues,” Goodson said.

Shares in Tourism Holdings (THL) gained a cent to $2.48 after today’s annual meeting.

In materials released for the meeting, the loss-making THL said that given the scale of its current transformation, it would not provide an earnings guidance.

“We remain confident that we have turned a corner and expect a return to net profit growth in 2026,” THL said.

Goodson said the US rentals business was “pretty tough” for THL.

“But they are seeing growth in their other markets and forward bookings for the rest of the financial year for New Zealand, Australia, and Canada are about 20% ahead of last year, which is encouraging,” Goodson said.

THL in August reported a $25.8m annual loss, compared with a $39.4m profit in the previous year.

Vista’s share price gained 10c or 3.65% at $2.84 after a positive earnings update but the stock was still a far cry from its $4 peak reached in March.

Looking ahead, a number of annual meetings and special meetings are due next week.

Rua Bioscience’s AGM is set down for Tuesday, while meetings for Ebos and SouthPort are due on Wednesday.

AGMs for Freightways, Mee Today and Move Logistics are due on Thursday, while Fonterra’s special meeting to vote on the sale of its consumer business is due on the same day.

On Friday, Sky City, Barramundi and Port of Tauranga hold their AGMs.

AAPL,Live Oak Bancshares Inc (LOB) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Strong Loan Growth and ...,Technology,"Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you provide more details on the increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) this quarter and the trends in new defaults? Also, what are your expectations for charge-offs? A: Michael Cairns, Chief Credit Officer, explained that the increase in NPAs is a continuation of previous trends, primarily from the SBA portfolio. The non-accrual balances are manageable, and the team is actively servicing the portfolio. Charge-offs are expected to decline, and the reserve levels remain healthy.

Q: How are you preparing for a potential extended government shutdown, and what impact could it have on loan growth and credit? A: Walter Phifer, CFO, stated that the company has a playbook for government shutdowns, including reserving SBA funding through PLPs. The team pushed to reserve $900 million in September to continue operations. The shutdown could impact secondary market sales if it extends past Thanksgiving, but the company is prepared to catch up once the market reopens.

Q: Can you quantify the benefits of AI enhancements in processing times and expense management? A: William Cameron, Independent Director, highlighted that AI is seen as a significant technological advancement. The company is educating employees on AI tools and building AI-driven solutions to improve productivity and customer experience. AI is expected to enhance operating leverage and profitability by reducing the need for employee growth while maintaining revenue levels.

Q: What is the expected trajectory for the net interest margin (NIM) given the current rate cut cycle? A: Walter Phifer, CFO, noted that as an asset-sensitive bank, margin variation is expected with rate cuts. The margin typically recovers quickly due to the short-term nature of the funding base. The focus is on net interest income growth, which remains resilient despite margin fluctuations.

Q: How is competition in the SBA space affecting your operations, especially with recent rule changes and credit cycles? A: William Cameron, Independent Director, stated that Live Oak Bancshares is well-versed in the SBA market and continues to grow despite competition. The company focuses on improving its operations and serving more customers, which is reflected in its strong results.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-24T05:00:49Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live-oak-bancshares-inc-lob-050049726.html,0.5,2025-10-25 13:39:52.321316,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,HUL Share Price Declines Nearly 4% After Q2 Results,Technology,"Hindustan Uniliever Ltd., shares declined as much as nearly 5% during trade so far. This comes after the company posted its second quarter results early Thursday.

The consensus among top brokerages remains largely positive on Hindustan Unilever Ltd., after the company posted its second quarter results yesterday. Names like Cti, Jefferies, and Goldman Sachs have maintained their 'buy' ratings, driven by the company's clear strategic focus on volume growth.

Jefferies leads with the highest target price hike to Rs 3,050, while Citi also raised its price target to Rs 3,000. Despite this, the market is factoring in short-term pain. Investec maintained a Hold with a marginally cut target price of Rs 2,610, and Morgan Stanley maintained an Equal-weight rating with a target of Rs 2,335, citing a slow recovery timeline.

The quarter two results were significantly impacted by a transitory trade destocking across the supply chain, as distributors held back purchases in anticipation of the Goods and Services Tax rate cuts. Management estimated this led to a substantial 200 basis points drag on growth.

Jefferies noted this Q2 impact, which is expected to continue into quarter three, will likely disappoint investors with a short-term orientation. Goldman Sachs, while maintaining Buy, cut its Earnings Per Share estimates to factor in a slower, more gradual recovery pace anticipated for the second half of the financial year.

HUL stock fell as much as 4.89% during the day to Rs 2,474.5 apiece on the NSE. It was trading 3.66% lower at Rs 2,506.5 apiece, compared to an 0.01% advance in the benchmark Nifty 50 as of 10:04 a.m.

It has risen 0.14% in the last 12 months and 7.82% on a year-to-date basis. The relative strength index was at 56.10.

Thirty three out of the 44 analysts tracking the company have a 'buy' rating on the stock, nine recommend a 'hold' and two suggest a 'sell', according to Bloomberg data. The 12-month analysts' consensus target price on the stock is Rs 2,789.6, implying a upside of 11.4%.",Ndtvprofit.com,2025-10-24T04:39:04Z,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/hul-share-price-decline-nearly-4-after-q2-results,0.5,2025-10-25 13:39:52.357132,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,"Nifty rally fuels renewed optimism; analysts eye 30,800 as medium-term target",Technology,"Synopsis

The Nifty 50 and Sensex touched near-record highs, fueled by festive-season optimism, supportive policies, and expectations of robust corporate earnings. Positive FII inflows and optimism around a potential India–U.S. trade deal further boosted sentiment. Technical analysts highlight bullish breakouts, including a Cup and Handle pattern, pointing to medium-term Nifty targets of 30,800, though near-term volatility cannot be ruled out.

The Nifty 50 extended its winning streak on Thursday, inching closer to its all-time high as optimism returned to Indian equities. With key technical levels being breached and supportive macro cues in place, analysts now see a medium-term upside potential towards the 30,800 mark.

Indian equities ended on a strong note, with the Nifty 50 closing at 25,891.40 and the Sensex at 84,556.40. Both benchmarks touched fresh 52-week highs, moving closer to their lifetime peaks amid renewed investor confidence, steady foreign inflows, and expectations of robust corporate earnings in the coming quarters.

The Nifty 50 touched an intraday high of 26,099, just 0.7% shy of its record peak, while the Sensex surged nearly 800 points to hit 85,272.40, only 0.8% below its all-time high.

Investor sentiment was further buoyed by expectations of strong festive-season demand, recent tax reductions, and supportive policy measures aimed at boosting corporate profitability in the second half of FY26.

Adding to the optimism was growing buzz around a potential India–U.S. trade deal. Reports suggest the two nations are nearing an agreement that could slash tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. from about 50% to 15–16%, potentially strengthening India’s export outlook.

Live Events

Commenting on the development, V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said:

""If the reported 15–16% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. materialise, it would be a big positive for the Indian economy and provide a major boost to stock markets. The ongoing festival-season rally is likely to accelerate, enabling the Nifty to set new record highs.""

Another key driver of the rally was a shift in stance by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). After months of persistent outflows, FIIs turned net buyers in October, investing over Rs 1,385 crore in Indian equities so far this month. This marked a sharp turnaround from September’s pullback of Rs 22,761 crore and even heavier selling in August and July.

Vijayakumar added, ""FIIs turning buyers and short covering are factors that could further propel the rally."" He emphasized that improving corporate earnings, supported by record sales, could strengthen the bullish sentiment.

From a technical perspective, analysts observed strong breakout signals. Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Ltd, noted:

""The past month has been remarkable for the markets, with the Nifty rallying from 24,600 to register a fresh calendar-year high of 26,104.""

He highlighted that the Nifty has broken out from a year-long consolidation, forming a classic Cup and Handle pattern, a bullish continuation setup.

""The breakout zone around 25,700 (June swing high) now acts as strong support, while the pattern remains valid as long as Nifty holds above its recent swing low of 24,600. Pattern projections indicate encouraging upside potential, with the golden retracement zone near 29,000 and a pattern target around 30,800, suggesting ample scope for further gains over the medium term,"" Bhosale projected.

However, near-term caution was advised by Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities:

""Upside momentum with high volatility continued on Thursday, and Nifty closed the day higher by just 22 points, lacking strength to sustain the highs. The index formed a bearish meeting line candle pattern, which could hint at a short-term reversal. This is not a good sign for bulls, and any weakness from here could confirm the downside pattern.""

Despite this, Shetti noted that the broader trend remains positive:

""The overall near-term trend of Nifty remains bullish. Any confirmation of a negative reversal is likely to trigger a short-term downward correction. Immediate support is placed at 25,700, while a decisive move above 26,100 could open the next upside towards 26,300–26,400 in the near term.""

While short-term resistance levels could create volatility, the broader consensus among analysts remains bullish. With supportive macro triggers, the return of FIIs, and technical breakouts in play, market experts see the Nifty heading towards 30,800 over the medium term, provided key support zones hold.

AAPL,"Wyndham (WH) Net Profit Margin Rises to 23.6%, Reinforcing Bull Narratives on Earnings Quality",Technology,"Valuation Discounts Versus Sector Stand Out

The stock trades at a Price-To-Earnings ratio of 17.2x, materially below both its peer average of 31.9x and the hospitality industry average of 24.3x. This creates a wide valuation gap.

Analysts' consensus view sees this valuation gap as an opportunity, provided targets are met, since the current share price of $76 is below the $100.03 analyst price target and the $101.07 DCF fair value.

The consensus notes that for Wyndham to hit consensus targets, earnings need to rise to $445.9 million with a forward PE of 22.2x by 2028. This scenario factors in margin gains and international growth potential.

However, consensus also points out that risks remain if revenue growth underachieves or higher-capital requirements weigh on returns, especially given recent warnings about financial position and dividend sustainability.

AAPL,Chemical companies may see muted growth amid pricing pressure,Technology,"Synopsis

Chemical companies anticipate a mixed September quarter. Volume recovery in some areas faces challenges from weak pricing and lower demand. Specialty and fluorine-based firms are poised for better results. Agrochemicals may see a weaker performance due to weather disruptions. Investors will monitor project launches and price trends.

ET Intelligence Group: Chemical companies are likely to report a mixed performance in the September quarter, as volume recovery in some segments is being offset by weak pricing, oversupply, and subdued demand, resulting in modest top-line gains and largely flat net profits. While specialty and fluorine-based companies are expected to fare better due to higher margins, commodity and agrochemical producers are likely to face earnings pressure. Aggregate estimates from brokerages point to year-on-year sales growth of about 5%, a 4% increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), and net profit growth of roughly 1% for the sector.

While volumes have improved, particularly in specialty chemicals, weak spreads and pricing pressure are likely to limit profitability. EBITDA margins are estimated to contract both sequentially and annually as product prices such as benzene, toluene and acetone have remained significantly lower compared with last year. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, most organic compound prices fell sharply in September with butadiene down 31%, benzene 19% and aniline 22% year-on-year, reflecting continued weakness in global demand. Brent crude prices fell to $69 per barrel in the September quarter, down from $80 per barrel a year earlier.

Oversupply, and soft demand also to weigh on profitability despite volume recovery in some segments

Front-loading of orders ahead of potential US tariffs may have temporarily supported sales, but a slowdown in ordering may emerge in the coming quarters. ""A slowdown in ordering by customers after the front-loading that occurred in the past two-three quarters will start to impact the results of some companies this quarter and may become more prominently visible starting the December quarter,"" noted Kotak Securities in a preview report.

Refrigerant gas players such as SRF and Gujarat Fluorochemicals, are expected to do well. Their margins could expand and operating profit may rise in double digits, aided by healthy pricing of R-32 refrigerant gas and robust demand in specialty verticals.

""Fluorine-based companies may witness a 13-86% growth in EBITDA, led by higher margins,"" said Elara Capital.

Live Events

The agrochemicals segment is set for a weaker-than-expected quarter. Axis Securities and Elara have highlighted that excess rainfall across major states has severely disrupted the season, leading to damaged crops and missed spraying rounds. This has impacted the on-ground consumption of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, dimming prospects for a strong recovery. Fertiliser makers, however, may record mild growth supported by steady consumption.

In the near term, investors will keenly watch the pace of new project launches, trends in refrigerant and fluorine prices, and US tariff decisions.

AAPL,Laurus Labs Q2: Shares Fall Over 3% Despite Surge In Net Profit,Technology,"Laurus Labs Ltd. shares declined over 3% on Friday, a day after the company reported strong second-quarter earnings. The decline comes despite the pharmaceutical firm posting a robust performance for the July–September period, with consolidated revenue rising 35.1% year-on-year to Rs 1,653.47 crore and net profit surging 883% to Rs 194.97 crore.

Laurus Labs is a research-driven pharmaceutical manufacturing organisation established in 2005. The company is involved in developing and manufacturing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Intermediates. The company says its position was strengthened by their backward-integration capability while remaining highly regulatory compliant across all operations.

The scrip fell as much as 3.43% to Rs 902.35 apiece. It pared losses to trade 0.88% lower at Rs 926.20 apiece, as of 10:30 a.m. This compares to a 0.27% decline in the NSE Nifty 50 Index.

It has risen 107.98% in the last 12 months. Total traded volume so far in the day stood at 2.5 times its 30-day average. The relative strength index was at 71.

Out of 17 analysts tracking the company, eight maintain a 'buy' rating, three recommend a 'hold,' and six suggest 'sell,' according to Bloomberg data.

AAPL,Ford is moving workers from its EV unit to boost production of its F-150 pickup truck,Technology,"Ford is ramping up production of its top-selling pickup truck, the F-150 series, and moving staff over from its EV unit to keep manufacturing rolling.

The auto company said in a press release on Thursday that it will increase the production of its best-selling trucks, the F-150 and F-Series Super Duty series, by more than 50,000 units in 2026.

""We are adding up to 1,000 new jobs to increase F-Series production to recover lost volume and fulfill strong customer demand,"" Ford's CEO, James Farley, said in a Thursday earnings call.

The increased output also aims to recover production losses from a fire at a plant belonging to the Atlanta-based Novelis, one of Ford's major aluminum suppliers.

The fire broke out in Novelis' Oswego plant in September. Ford's finance chief said in the earnings call that the fire could cost Ford up to $2 billion in adjusted profits for the fourth quarter of 2025.

The increased focus on the gas and hybrid F-150 pickup trucks means that Ford will halt the production of its electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning.

""F-150 Lightning assembly at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center will remain paused as Ford prioritizes gas and hybrid F-Series trucks, which are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminum,"" the press release said.

The company reported third-quarter revenue of $50.5 billion, a 9% increase from the same period a year ago. Its stock price has risen about 11.6% in the past year.

This is not the first time Ford's EV unit has taken hits as the company looks to slash costs. At the end of 2024, Ford paused F-150 Lightning production for seven weeks to cut costs.

AAPL,Future of Marketing Briefing: Marketers confront a new kind of brand safety problem in AI video,Technology,"The real question is where marketers draw the line. Because while it’s fashionable to lump everything under the label of “AI slop”, marketers are learning it’s not that simple. Yes, AI slop exists but treating it as a blanket for all AI-generated content misses the point. One person’s slop to avoid is another’s must-watch.

In the end, it’s about discernment, knowing when automation becomes noise and when it can still serve the story.

“From the conversations we’re having with agencies and advertisers, the general view is that this is a hot topic that’s on their radar but they don’t have answers yet,” said Steven Filler, U.K country manager at digital video ad company ShowHeroes. “It’s got to a point where they’ve realized they need to act soon given how much of this content is escalating”

It’s the same old brand safety debate, resurfacing in the generative AI era — and, as before, it’s sending marketers back to the cottage industry of measurement and verification firms built to help them make the call.

Over the past month, Zefr has hosted a series of workshops with marketers and agency leaders to help them make sense of it all — breaking down the types of AI-generated content driving views across platforms and working with these execs to figure out how they might decide what they’re fine appearing alongside, and what they’d rather steer clear of.

But those decisions don’t stay fixed for long. What feels safe today can become problematic tomorrow as new AI-driven trends surface by the hour. The speed at which the content is being produced means marketers have to keep watching.

That’s why Zefr built a tool to continuously track AI-generated material appearing in ad campaigns, similar to how traditional brand systems flag risky content across platforms. It gives marketers a view into where their ads are showing up and whether that adjacency feels like an opportunity or a liability.

“This is going to end up being the next big brand safety problem,” said Andrew Serby, chief commercial officer at Zefr.

Eventually, though, it won’t only be a safety issue. It will become a brand suitability one — a test of how much chaos, creativity and algorithmic weirdness a brand is willing to stand next to.

“Whatever signals that content is emanating , from believability to virality to contention, it should be independent of the fact that it was generated by an AI,” said Anudit Vikram, chief product officer at digital video optimization company Channel Factory. “As long as those signals align with a marketer’s brand then it’s their choice to say whether or not they want to be associated with that content.”

He and his team are in the early stages of helping marketers do that very thing.

Step one is showing them whether a video is AI-made at all. That sounds easy enough — plenty of AI videos have telltale seams — but the fidelity is improving fast. The monitoring stack has to keep up, pulling signals from frame-level artifacts and lip-synch oddities to audio cues, watermarking and metadata patterns.

From there Channel Factory adds that AI classification into a broader analysis of the content and the channel it’s on, looking at factors like industry categorisation, age, language, gender classification. The goal is to give marketers a clearer picture of what AI-generated videos they want their ads against and what they might want to avoid, before Spongebob, or whatever comes next, turns into the next brand safety snafu. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but that moment will come. It always does.

“Most of them are really just trying to understand what the future will look like with AI-generated video,” said Lindsey Gamble, creator economy expert and advisor, who is having those conversations now. “There are just too many risks, like brand safety, where their content might appear, and potential copyright violations, so most aren’t planning to take action right now. They’re really just waiting to see what other brands do, but generally hesitate until platforms or tools build out solutions that address more of these risks.”

A widening spectrum

In some ways, all of this — the tools, the workshops, the meetings — underscores an uncomfortable truth about modern marketing. It doesn’t just manage risk, it monetizes it. Entire businesses now exist to help brands navigate an environment built on perpetual anxiety, where the wrong adjunct or viral post can spark reputational fallout overnight. It’s not cynical exactly — rather its the cost of doing business in an ecosystem where technology evolves faster than the safeguards meant to contain it.

“We use a framework with clients to identify how far they want to push it and what their guardrails are,” said Salazar Llewellyn, editorial director at ad agency DEPT. “Our approach is always human-led, craft-first, augmented with AI. You can’t automate good judgment. You can use data to inform, but it’s essential to understand what content is good and is worthy of your brand association, and which is just flooding feeds and platforms with this ‘slop’.”

At least, that’s the idea. In reality, it’s not always clear when AI is even being used. Disclosure rules are inconsistent — when they exist at all — and creators don’t always follow them. That opacity makes it even harder for mallets to draw clear lines between what’s acceptable and what’s not, especially as AI content becomes both harder to detect and easier to buy.

YouTube, as always, offers the clearest picture of that tension.

It’s a platform where faceless channel creators build legitimate direct-to-consumer businesses alongside others who use the same tools to farm views within YouTube’s acceptable boundaries.

The result is a rising tide of AI-generated channels of wildly varying quality, from faceless creators like Kurzgesagt, whose videos marry precision and craft, to an ocean of others detached from any editorial judgement or intent to tell the truth,

And that spectrum is only going to get wider. The platforms will make sure of it. The more tools they release, the more people can create, and the more content gets made, the more engagement — and ad revenue — they can capture. The machine keeps feeding itself.

A moment of reckoning

For now, though, most marketers are still in watch-and-wait mode. The launch of OpenAI’s Sora app, which helped socialize AI video creation, caught many off guard. In that moment, they saw both the risk and the reward of it, especially as those videos began spreading across the wider internet and being monetized elsewhere.

Rather than reacting immediately, they’re taking a beat — building frameworks, refining theses and drafting policies that will shape their advertising strategies in the year ahead.

“I would be surprised if brands aren’t implementing these policies in their ad campaigns from Q1 next year,” said Serby.

YouTube draws a line on AI as OpenAI’s Sora sparks backlash

AI has become such a divisive topic for creators, especially with the latest Sora standalone app launch from OpenAI. On the one hand, there are creators leaning into the tools to scale and enable them to create richer, more compelling content. On the other hand, there are the creators that feel AI content goes against everything they believe in: authenticity.

YouTube, for its part, is trying to strike a balance. Its latest moves suggest a platform eager to distinguish itself from the chaos surrounding OpenAI — and to reassert that creators remain its core constituency.

“We think there’s something to be said for taking the more responsible path,” said Sarah Jardine, senior strategist at SEEN Connects. “If we fail to protect creator IP, we’re at risk of homogenising culture and creativity.”

Jardine’s referring to YouTube’s recent policy updates, including its crackdown on low-effort, AI-generated slop content and the rollout of a new likeness-detection system for creators in its partner program. The tool flags videos that appear to use a creator’s image, whether through altered or synthetic versions and lets them request removals. It’s an early but notable step toward giving creators control over how their likeness is used in the age of generative video.

OpenAI, meanwhile, has taken the opposite tack. Sora’s rollout allowed users to generate videos of real people, living and dead, without consent — a choice that quickly backfired after users began producing disrespectful depictions of Martin Luther King Jr. and other public figures. The company’s belated decision to “pause” such generations at the request of King’s estate, underscored a larger problem: its policies were being built in real-time in response to PR crises rather than principle.

Varun Shetty, vp of media partnerships at OpenAI, explained its stance in an emailed statement:“We’re engaging directly with studios and rightsholders, listening to feedback, and learning from how people are using Sora 2. Many are creating original videos and excited about interacting with their favorite characters, which we see as an opportunity for rightsholders to connect with fans and share in that creativity. We’re removing generated characters from Sora’s public feed and will be rolling out updates that give rightsholders more control over their characters and how fans can create with them.”

By contrast, YouTube’s play looks less like moral grandstanding and more like pragmatic ecosystem management.

“By building safeguards for creator likeness and tightening monetisation for low-effort AI work, YouTube is protecting the quality of its ecosystem — and, crucially, the relationships between creators, audiences, and brands,” Billion Dollar Boy’s co-founder and chief innovation officer Thomas Walters. “The approach contrasts sharply with OpenAI’s recent struggles to define coherent IP and consent policies.”

Q: There seems to be an increase in subprime and deep subprime loans in your indirect auto portfolio. Can you explain this?

Another View: What Do Valuation Ratios Say?

Looking at Tencent's valuation through the lens of its price-to-earnings ratio, the stock trades at 25.2 times earnings. This is higher than the Asian Interactive Media and Services industry average of 22.5 and above the peer average of 23.3. However, it remains well below the fair ratio implied by regression analysis, which sits at 34.6.

AAPL,"Intel Nova Lake CPUs Bring New Architecture & Software Upgrades, First Panther Lake SKUs This Year, 18A To Cover At least Next-Three Client & Server Products",Technology,"Intel talked about its upcoming Panther Lake, Nova Lake, Coral Rapids CPUs, and its Foundry plans involving 18A & 14A during its Q3 earnings call.

Intel Confirms That 18A Will Be Used By At Least the Next 3 Generations of Client and Server Products

During the Q3 2025 earnings call, Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, talked about his plans for how the blue team will go forward with its client, server, and foundry-side businesses. The talk mainly focused on expanding on most of the stuff that the company has already highlighted recently, along with a few new key points.

Starting with the first one, Lip-Bu once again reaffirmed that the first Panther Lake CPU SKU will be launched by the end of this year, while additional SKUs will follow in the first half of 2026. Intel itself has confirmed that Panther Lake CPUs will launch at CES 2026, where the company will do a full unveil, and the first PCs based on the Core Ultra Series 3 family will be available in January. The first SKU is also going to be more premium, but as the ramp continues on 18A, Panther Lake will enter more cost-effective territory.

In addition to that, Intel once again reaffirms that the high-end desktop segment remains an intense battlefield, but they're making steady progress. The company is expected to refresh its Arrow Lake CPU family with Core Ultra 200S Plus soon on the LGA 1851 socket, which will be succeeded by the Nova Lake-S platform on the LGA 1954 socket in 2H 2026. Nova Lake is expected to feature up to 52 cores, new Xe3P Arc iGPUs, and also feature brand new architecture and software changes.

In addition, and just as important, the group will spearhead the build out of a new basic and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon to a broad range of external customers. This will not only extend the reach of our core x86 IP, but also leverage our design strength to deliver an array of solutions from general purpose to fixed function computing. In client, we are on track to launch our first Panther Lake SKU by year end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of next year.

This will help us to solidify our strong position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise with cost-optimized products across our full PC stack from our entry-level offering to our mainstream core family up to our highest performing core ultra family. In high-end desktops, competition remains intense, but we are making steady progress. Arrow Lake shipments have increased throughout the years, and our next generation Nova Lake product will bring new architectural and software upgrades to further strengthen our offering, particularly in the PC-thinning hello space.

Lip-Bu Tan - Intel CEO (Q3 2025 Earnings Call)

On the server side, Intel pointed out that demand for its Granite Rapids (Xeon 6 P-Core) CPUs remains strong and now includes instances across every major hyperscaler. The company also expects the CCG (Client Computing Group) segment to be down in the coming quarter, but the strong demand in server chips will lead to gains for the DCAI group.

Intel's Xeon family will also see new additions to the family with the Xeon 6+ ""Clearwater Forest"" chips around mid-2026, which are based on 18A, Diamond Rapids P-Core family on 18A under the Xeon 7 family, and the next-gen Coral Rapids SKUs, which will reintroduce SMT back to Xeon.

We remain the AI hit notes of choice, with strong demand for granite rapids, including instances across every major hyperscaler.

So I think clearly the Diamond Rapids getting stronger, hyper-skilled feedback. And then we also focus on the new product, the Coral Rapids, and that will be included SMT, the master trading, and that can drive higher performance. We're in the definition stage, and then we will work out the roadmap, and then we're going to execute that in the work year going forward.

Lip-Bu Tan - Intel CEO (Q3 2025 Earnings Call)

On the Foundry side of things (IFS), Intel seems to be making steady progress on 18A, which is entering HVM at Fab 52 in Arizona, which we recently toured during Tech Tour 2025. The blue team is also working towards the 18A-P PDK milestone, and one major thing confirmed by Intel is that the 18A process tech is going to span at least three generations of client and server products. Do note that the 18A-P is more of a performance-optimized variant of 18A, offering 10% higher gains. Lip-Bu also sheds some light on 14A & EMIB-T.

We are making steady progress on Intel 18A. We are on track to bring Panther Lake to market this year. Intel 18A yields are progressing at a predictable rate, and Fab 52 in Arizona, which is dedicated to high-volume manufacturing, is now fully operational.

In addition, we are advancing our work on Intel 18A-P, and we continue to hit our PDK milestone. Our Intel 18A family is the foundation for at least the next three generations of client and server products.

On Intel 14A, the team continues to focus on technology definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, and foundation IP. We remain active, engaged with potential external customers, and are encouraged by the earlier feedback, which helps us to drive and inform our decisions.

Lastly, our advanced packaging activities continue to progress well, especially in the areas like EMIB and EMIB-T, which we have true differentiation. Like our Intel products, my conviction in the market potential for Intel foundry continues to grow. The rapid expansion of critical AI infrastructure is fueling unprecedented demand for wafer capacity and advanced packaging services that present a substantial opportunity, demanding multiple suppliers.

Intel foundry is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this unprecedented demand as we execute. As I mentioned last quarter, our investment in foundry will be disciplined, and we will focus on capability and scalability, giving us flexibility to ramp quickly, and we will only add capacity when we have committed external demand. Building a world class foundry is a long‑term effort founded on trust.

As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they call on us to build wafers to meet all their needs for power, performance, yield, cost, and schedule. This is only by doing this that they can rely on us as a true long‑term partner to ensure their success.

This requires a change of mindset that I'm driving across Intel foundry as we position this business for long‑term success. As we look ahead, my focus remains firmly on the long‑term opportunity across every market we serve today, and those we will enter tomorrow. Our strategy is crystallized around our unique strength and value proposition supported by the accelerating and unprecedented demand for compute in the AI‑driven economy.

Lip-Bu Tan - Intel CEO (Q3 2025 Earnings Call)

And lastly, for those who want to hear more about Intel's GPU side, yep, both Arc and GPUs were mentioned. Plus, Intel also referenced its recent announcement of Crescent Island, the first Xe3P accelerator designed for AI inference workloads. The company is working on a multi-generational roadmap, which will focus on a chip with enhanced memory and bandwidth. You can learn more about Crescent Island here.

In the near term, we will continue delivering AI capabilities to Xeon, AI PCs, ARC, GPUs, and our open software stack. Looking ahead, we plan to launch successive generations of inference-optimized GPUs on the annual cadence that features enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.

Lip-Bu Tan - Intel CEO (Q3 2025 Earnings Call)

Once again, this is just a follow-up and add-on to what Intel has already stated over the last few months. The first 18A product, Panther Lake, is coming out soon, so it won't be long before we know how 18A performs in real-world scenarios and what surprises it holds for future products on the client and server side.",Wccftech,2025-10-24T01:55:09Z,https://wccftech.com/intel-nova-lake-cpus-new-architecture-software-upgrades-first-panther-lake-skus-this-year-18a-next-three-client-server-products/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:39:53.970920,0.9999999999999999,

A: CEO Fred Effinger explained that the company is seeing significant share shifts, particularly in the 15 targeted states, with a 16.5% growth.

AAPL,South Plains Financial Inc (SPFI) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Strong Earnings Growth ...,Technology,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Release Date: October 23, 2025

For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

South Plains Financial Inc (NASDAQ:SPFI) reported strong earnings growth in the third quarter, supported by net interest income expansion.

The company has improved the credit quality of its loan portfolio and expanded its return on assets.

SPFI has built strong liquidity and capital, positioning itself for potential asset growth through organic growth and M&A opportunities.

The bank is actively recruiting experienced lenders, which is expected to accelerate loan growth in the coming year.

SPFI's capital ratios exceed the minimum regulatory levels, allowing for continued growth and shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks.

Negative Points

The company experienced higher than normal loan paydowns, which has been a headwind to loan growth.

Non-interest income decreased by $1 million in the third quarter, primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking revenues.

The yield on loans decreased slightly from the previous quarter, and future loan yields are expected to moderate.

There is a noted migration of credit scores downward in the indirect auto loan portfolio, although it hasn't yet impacted delinquencies.

The company faces challenges in maintaining loan growth amidst economic uncertainties and potential credit stress in the market.

Is SPFI fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

Q: You discussed your plan to increase your lending team by up to 20% next year. How much of that growth is coming from true lenders versus support staff, and how many lenders should we use as a base for this growth? A: The base is about 40, and none of that includes support staff; it's all production. We've already achieved north of 10% growth so far this year. (Unidentified_4)

Q: Are there any particular markets where you expect growth from your lending team expansion? A: Yes, we expect growth in the Permian, Houston, and Dallas areas. (Unidentified_4)

Q: Can you explain the increase in subprime and deep subprime concentration in your indirect auto loans? A: The numbers shown are updated information, not as of origination date, which is why it looks different. This reflects changes in borrower credit scores. (Unidentified_2)

Q: Regarding the $50 million of subordinated debt you redeemed, what was the incremental cost associated with that? A: We were paying 4.5% interest, which would have increased to 8%. There was no expense incurred to redeem it as it was done within the call period. (Unidentified_2)

Q: Could you talk about your previous experience with aggressive hiring and how you're applying that to the current market? A: Previously, we were focused on replacing retirees and expanding our team. Now, we're taking advantage of good opportunities to expand in markets. We model hires to break even in 6 months or less, ensuring a credit culture fit. (Unidentified_4)

Q: What are the criteria for a good acquisition target for South Plains? A: The primary criterion is a culture fit. We focus on successful banks with customer loyalty and a long-term mindset. The numbers must also align, and we look for banks that want to join us as investors for long-term growth. (Unidentified_3)

Q: How do you view the potential for continued payoffs in your commercial real estate book given recent rate dips? A: We expect some scheduled payoffs of completed projects into the first and second quarters of next year. We are not lowering credit standards to retain loans and are focused on replacing them with new business. (Unidentified_8)

Q: Does the migration of credit scores in your indirect auto portfolio concern you? A: We monitor credit scores actively and have not seen a rise in delinquencies or credit issues. The portfolio's average duration is over two years, and we focus on higher-end credit profiles. (Unidentified_8)

Nidec Withdraws Full-Year Forecasts, Cancels Buyback Amid Accounting Probe Back to video

Article content

It also said it won’t pay an interim dividend for the fiscal year ending March 2026, its first suspension of a midterm payout in at least a quarter century. The company had previously planned to pay ¥20 per share as of April.

Article content

Nidec’s crisis came to light last month when the firm said it found evidence that senior executives may have been involved in a number of accounting issues at subsidiaries. An external committee is investigating the cases after an internal probe into a payment of approximately ¥200 million by Nidec Techno Motor in Zhejiang sparked concern.

Article content

“While it is as yet unclear by how much the accounting issues will affect overall earnings, investors are likely to assume a wait and see position until there is full disclosure,” said Julie Boote, an automotive analyst at London-based research firm Pelham Smithers Associates Ltd. “We expect markets to react negatively, and in particular to withdrawal of the previously indicated dividend payment.”

Article content

The investigation underscores concerns about governance at one of Japan’s most acquisitive manufacturers, and raised questions about whether decades of rapid expansion under its founder came at the cost of oversight and internal controls.

Article content

The accounting issues at the Zhejiang unit follows errors in country-of-origin declarations and unpaid import tariffs at a subsidiary in Italy that have gummed up the company’s financial reports. That’s even as Nidec seeks to overhaul a business that for years had been under the tight control of founder Shigenobu Nagamori.

Article content

Under his leadership, Nidec became one of the world’s leading suppliers of motors used to power everything from server fans, car transmissions and elevators to EV charging systems and wind turbines. But more recently, the company has struggled with lackluster demand for motors in appliances, PCs and cars.

Article content

Nagamori stepped down from the chief executive officer post last year, entrusting new CEO Mitsuya Kishida to spearhead a turnaround.

Article content

Nidec has already announced plans to cut headcount and slash half its roughly 250 production sites by March 2028, while pivoting to more lucrative arenas in data centers and energy generation. The world’s top maker of mini motors is eyeing higher-margin areas such as machine tools, power generation and energy storage, while it expands into water-cooling systems used in artificial intelligence data centers.

Article content

It’s unclear how far back the accounting issues reach. The company said it may revise past or current securities reports depending on the findings and will announce new forecasts and a year-end dividend when possible.

Article content

“For investors, there’s nothing to do but wait and see,” said Ikuo Mitsui, a fund manager at Aizawa Securities Co.

AAPL,Bitcoin and S&P 500 Enter Late Bull Phase – Markets Stay Risk-On Ahead Of Q4 Earnings,Technology,"Bitcoin continues to struggle to break decisively above the $110,000 mark following the October 10 market crash, as volatility and uncertainty dominate sentiment. The market now stands at a critical crossroads — one that could define whether the next phase brings a deep correction or sets the stage for a massive recovery.

According to top analyst Axel Adler, both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 remain in what he calls the late bull phase. The S&P 500’s 52-week return currently sits at +13%, reflecting that global markets remain in a risk-on environment, with investors still willing to take exposure to growth-oriented assets. Adler notes that the BTC–S&P correlation currently stands at 0.26, meaning Bitcoin tends to move in the same direction as equities, though not entirely in lockstep.

This moderate correlation suggests that while macro factors like earnings and monetary policy still influence Bitcoin, its internal dynamics — such as liquidity shifts and derivatives positioning — remain key. However, Adler warns that the S&P 500’s sensitivity to macro and political narratives could quickly spill over into the crypto market. Any cooling in equities or broader risk sentiment could pressure Bitcoin and define its next major move.

Bitcoin Mirrors Late-Cycle Market Behavior as Q4 Earnings Take Center Stage

According to Axel Adler, the final quarter of 2025 marks a crucial transition point for both traditional and crypto markets. After nearly two years of steady yield growth and tight monetary policy, the macro focus is shifting from expectations to real corporate performance. The Q3 earnings season is now in full swing, and early results have been surprisingly strong — out of 58 companies that have reported so far, all have beaten estimates by an average of 571 basis points (bps). Moreover, expected earnings growth for the quarter has climbed from 7% to 8%, reinforcing the idea that markets are still in the final phase of a bull cycle.

This late-cycle behavior typically reflects investor optimism, even as underlying risks — such as stretched valuations, declining liquidity, and macro uncertainty — begin to surface. Adler notes that such conditions often coincide with high volatility across risk assets, including Bitcoin, which tends to track broader shifts in investor sentiment.

For crypto markets, this context is particularly relevant. Bitcoin’s muted reaction to strong earnings data suggests that institutional flows remain cautious, waiting for confirmation of macro stability before re-entering risk positions. Historically, when equity markets approach the peak of their bull cycle, Bitcoin can either decouple and surge amid renewed liquidity or follow equities downward during a correction phase.

Adler concludes that the current setup aligns with a late-bull, pre-cooling environment — a moment defined by strong short-term optimism but fragile long-term balance. The coming weeks, driven by the remaining earnings reports and central bank commentary, will determine whether this momentum fuels another Bitcoin rally or marks the beginning of a broader market cooldown.

Bulls Defend Key Support, Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation

Bitcoin is currently trading around $109,300, showing modest recovery momentum after finding support near the 100-day moving average (green line). The 3-day chart reveals that BTC remains in a consolidation structure, oscillating between $106,000 and $117,500, the latter acting as a significant resistance level since mid-September.

The $117,500 zone continues to mark the upper boundary of the current range, aligning with the previous high-volume node from the August–September period. This level represents the Point of Control for the recent trading structure and is critical for defining short-term direction. A successful breakout above it would likely trigger momentum toward $123,000, where large liquidity clusters and short liquidations are positioned.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average (blue line) sits near $111,000, overlapping with the mid-range level, while the 200-day moving average (red line) near $90,000 remains a longer-term support base.

Bitcoin’s trend remains neutral-to-bullish, but confidence is fragile. A strong close above $111,000–$112,000 could signal renewed strength, while a rejection here would likely confirm extended consolidation or even a deeper correction toward $105,000. The next few sessions will determine whether BTC can regain momentum or face renewed selling pressure.

The slowest pace in three months for underlying inflation was welcomed by traders, who’ve been flying almost blind amid the dearth of data since the start of the government shutdown. The September core consumer price index increased 0.2% from August. On an annual basis, it rose 3%.

While the central bank was already expected to lower rates next week, the report may help convince officials they can do so again in December. There was little in the benign CPI data to “spook” the Fed, noted Lindsay Rosner at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

“Investors are grabbing the bull by the horns after this morning’s lighter-than-anticipated CPI bolstered the case for a series of rate cuts this year and next,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.

The US government will probably be unable to release inflation data for October, the White House said Friday, citing the ongoing government shutdown.

The S&P 500 rose almost 1%, briefly topping 6,800. Treasury two-year yields slid one basis point to 3.48%. The dollar wavered.

As long as incoming data signal more risk to employment than to inflation, the Fed’s policy path likely points toward additional easing, said Jason Pride at Glenmede.

“The Fed has been clear that they are more focused on the softening labor data and will continue to defend their full employment mandate” even with inflation running above target, said Art Hogan at B. Riley Wealth.

The CPI report confirms what we’ve seen overall from private data during the government shutdown — little indication that inflation is surging or that the labor market is falling off a cliff, according to Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

“For a Fed focused on prudent ‘risk management,’ that should translate into another rate cut next week, and likely more to follow,” she said.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-24T01:39:17Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-join-global-equity-rally-231917469.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-25 13:39:54.102180,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know,,"In this article:

We get into the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 800 companies reporting results, including five of the Magnificent 7 members and almost a third of S&P 500 members. We have Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platform META, and Alphabet GOOGL on deck to report results on Wednesday, October 29th, and Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday, October 30th.

With Tesla’s results already out, only Nvidia remains to report Q3 results, which are scheduled for November 19th.

Except for Apple, the four Mag 7 members reporting this week are all leaders in the artificial intelligence space and are actively investing in setting up data centers and related infrastructure to run large language models.

A big marker in the AI debate around these companies has been the ever-rising level of capital expenditures, a race from which Apple has been missing in action, helping explain a big part of the stock’s recent underperformance.

Alphabet shares have enjoyed favorable momentum lately. A positive conclusion to the DOJ’s case has been the primary catalyst, but Alphabet’s last two quarterly reports were also very strong.

The market will be focused on the company’s cloud business, where improved capacity is expected to build on the acceleration seen in the last quarterly report. Management’s commentary around the cloud business was very positive in July, likely indicative of a very favorable demand backdrop and some market share gains. The technical challenges faced by Amazon’s AWS clients in recent days were after the Q3 reporting period, but will also likely come up on the earnings calls.

One perennial market worry about Alphabet is the outlook for the search business in the emerging AI world, with many in the market concerned that Alphabet may not be able to sustain its dominance of this lucrative space. Alphabet’s July results went some ways towards easing those worries, but a strong showing this time will consolidate those gains.

Looking at Q3 expectations for the group as a whole, the expectation is that Mag 7 earnings will increase +11.9% in 2025 Q3 from the same period last year on +15.3% higher revenues. These expectations are a blend of Tesla's actual results and estimates for the remaining six, of which five are on deck to report this week.

The chart below shows the group’s 2025 Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what was achieved in the preceding period and what is expected in the coming three quarters.

AAPL,Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know,,"We get into the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 800 companies reporting results, including five of the Magnificent 7 members and almost a third of S&P 500 members.

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

Barron’s recently had an article discussing whether Warren Buffett sold shares of Apple AAPL from the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio too soon. He first started selling Apple in the fourth quarter of 2023 and sold throughout 2024.

But shares of Apple recently hit new all-time highs. Even though Buffett did not sell his entire Apple position, he certainly left some money on the table.

It was a similar story with Bank of America BAC, but Buffett didn’t start selling Bank of America until mid-2024 and continued into 2025.

Over the last year, Bank of America shares have gained 22%.

Berkshire Hathaway may not have it’s massive Apple position anymore, and it now owns less than a 10% position in Bank of America, but it still has a position in both. It also has $350 billion in cash to deploy at any time.

3 Stocks Near Their All-Time Highs

Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT

Vertiv is an AI infrastructure company that is in partnership with NVIDIA on the build out of the data centers. Shares of Vertiv recently hit new all-time highs and are up 872% in the last 5 years.

Should investors be cashing in Vertiv?

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Shares of United Rentals recently traded near their all-time highs. It’s up 385.7% over the last 5 years.

Should investors be cashing in United Rentals?

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT

Hilton Worldwide Holdings, the hospitality company with hotels around the world, recently beat again on earnings. Hilton has beat every quarter for the last 4 years. That’s an impressive earnings surprise streak.

Shares of Hilton are near 5-year highs and are up 182.9% during that period. It’s not cheap, however. Hilton has a forward P/E of 34.7. A P/E over 30 is considered to be an expensive stock.

Should investors be cashing in Hilton?

AAPL,"5 Titans Lead Huge Earnings; Fed Rate Cut, Trump-Xi Ahead",,"The stock market is at record highs heading into peak earnings week, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Google and Amazon all on tap. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates for a second straight meeting. President Donald Trump is set to meet President Xi Jinping amid trade tensions.
Capital spending plans from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) will be hugely important for the AI boom, which is leading the stock market rally and overall economy.
Dozens of other notable companies also will be reporting.
Tesla Leads Stocks To Watch
The stock market remains volatile, but the major indexes are at all-time highs. Investors should be looking for stocks in buy zones or setting up, but be judicious about adding exposure. Tesla (TSLA), Snowflake (SNOW), GE Aerospace (GEV), TechnipFMC (FTI) and TJX Cos. (TJX) all fit that bill. Tesla, GE, and TechnipFMC have just reported earnings, while Snowflake and TJX are weeks away from their next quarterly release.
Fed Set To Cut Rates Again
The Fed is a lock to cut its key interest rate by another quarter-point on Wednesday, with the policy statement due at 2 p.m. ET. Chairman Jerome Powell's 2:30 p.m. news conference may signal whether a further rate cut on Dec. 10 is a sure bet following the September CPI report. There's a strong chance the Fed also will announce an end to quantitative tightening, the shrinking of its balance sheet by up to $5 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in mortgage securities per month. Policymakers could decide to reinvest maturing mortgage securities in Treasuries. That expectation may have helped bring down the 10-year Treasury yield.
The rest of the economic calendar is bare due to the ongoing government shutdown, and its bite is set to worsen over the coming week. Numerous states are warning that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are set to be turned off.
Trump-Xi Meeting
Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) in South Korea, which runs Oct. 31-Nov. 1. Investors are hoping for a deal, or at least a cease-fire, to let Trump scrap or push back an extra 100% China tariff set to kick in on Nov. 1. That threatened tariff followed China's stricter curbs on rare earths and key EV battery components.
A new round of China trade talks, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, got underway in Malaysia on Friday and are set to run through Monday.
Microsoft Azure Sales In Focus
Microsoft (MSFT) will report fiscal first-quarter results late Wednesday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect EPS to climb 11% to $3.66 with revenue up 15% to $75.4 billion. The Azure cloud computing business will be a key focus area as will its Copilot AI services. Wall Street expects Azure revenue growth of 38% year over year. For the December quarter, analysts are looking for EPS to climb 18% with sales up 15% to $80 billion.
Apple Seen Getting iPhone Lift
Apple (AAPL) will post its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Wall Street expects Apple to earn $1.77 a share, up 8% year over year, on sales of $102 billion, up 7.5%. Fiscal Q4 includes the first couple of weeks of sales for the Apple iPhone 17 series smartphones. For the December quarter, fiscal Q1 for Apple, analysts are forecasting earnings of $2.53 a share, up 5.5%, on sales of $131.4 billion, up nearly 6%.
Is AI Boosting Google's Search Ads?
Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reports late on Oct. 29. Analysts expect Q3 EPS to rise 8% to $2.28 with revenue climbing 13% to $99.9 billion. With a beat, Google could top $100 billion in revenue for the first time. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on the search advertising business remains a key issue. Google began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid-2024, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. Wall Street analysts expect the cloud business to turn in 29% revenue growth. Analysts will look for commentary from Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi on cost cutting and hiring trends amid a shift to AI-based software coding.
Amazon Web Services In Focus
Amazon.com (AMZN) reports late Thursday, with analysts forecasting Q3 earnings rising 10% to $1.57 per share, with revenue up 12% to $177.85 billion. After a lackluster Q2 compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, Amazon's cloud business will be in focus. Wall Street is forecasting AWS sales of $32.4 billion, up 18% year over year. Meanwhile, CEO Andy Jassy's commentary will be parsed for clues about what impact tariffs are having on Amazon's massive e-commerce operations, including prices. Amazon's guidance for the holiday quarter will also be closely watched.
Meta Platforms Due With Spending Key
Meta Platforms (META) will report third-quarter results late Wednesday. Analysts expect the Facebook parent to report an 11% EPS gain to $6.69 per share while sales increase 22% to $49.4 billion. Analysts are forecasting continued strength for advertising sales from Facebook and Instagram. But investors will be listening for updates on the costs of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of developing cutting-edge AI capabilities. Meta has previously told investors it expects to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion on capital expenditures this year. Earlier this month, the viral rise of OpenAI's Sora AI-generated video app weighed on shares of Meta, as it presented a potential competitor.
Hard Driving Stocks On Tap
Hard-disk drive rivals Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) are set to report, as excitement about AI data center demand has powered triple-digit rallies for both stocks. Seagate will publish results late Tuesday. Analysts are looking for a 52% increase in adjusted earnings to $2.40 per share. Sales are seen rising 17% to $2.55 billion. Western Digital goes late Thursday, with analysts expecting adjusted EPS of $1.59 per share. Sales are projected to come in at $2.83 billion. Western Digital completed a spinoff of its Sandisk (SNDK) flash memory business earlier this year, making year-over-year comparisons imprecise. But analysts forecast hard-disk drive revenue increased 17% year over year for the September-ended quarter, according to FactSet.
Software Stocks On Tap
ServiceNow (NOW) reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 28. Analysts expect the enterprise software maker to report EPS of $4.26, up 14% from a year earlier, with revenue growing 20% to $3.355 billion. Worries over ServiceNow's exposure to federal government purchases have pressured the stock in 2025. The software maker is still in the early stages of monetizing AI. Atlassian (TEAM) reports fiscal Q1 earnings on Oct. 30. Analysts estimate EPS of 84 cents, up 9%, with revenue rising 18% to $1.402 billion. Cloudflare (NET) reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 30. Analysts estimate EPS of 23 cents, up 16%, with revenue climbing 27% to $544.6 million. Cloudflare works to speed up and provide security for web applications. NET shares are moving toward a buy point.
Aerospace Earnings
Aerospace firms continue to roll out results. FTAI Aviation (FTAI), a provider of engines, parts and maintenance services, reports Monday. Components manufacturer Howmet Aerospace (HWM) and defense contractor L3Harris (LHX) are on tap Thursday. FactSet expects FTAI will report a 59% increase in earnings on a 41% jump in revenue. FTAI stock is near record highs within a short consolidation. Analysts predict a 21% EPS increase for Howmet on 11% revenue growth. HWM stock is in a buy zone, above a 193.26 buy point following a Sept. 23 breakout. LHX stock climbed in a buy zone after announcing a South Korea contract. FactSet expects earnings to decline 23% while revenue rises 7%.
Visa, Mastercard Charge Up Results
The two credit card giants will both report earnings next week. Visa (V) will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday night, with analysts expecting EPS up 16% to $2.71 as revenue climbs 9% to $10.62 billion. Mastercard (MA) will release Q3 figures early Wednesday. Earnings should advance 11% to $4.32 a share with revenue up 16% to $8.54 billion. Analysts will want to see if consumer spending remains robust. Both stocks are in the bottom half of lengthy flat bases.
Oil Majors Set To Parade Earnings
Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) report third-quarter earnings early Friday. Chevron and Exxon Mobil are forecast to continue their trend of quarterly year-over-year earnings declines, with analysts predicting Exxon profit falling 5% while Chevron EPS is expected to sink 32%, according to FactSet. Lagging U.S. oil prices, which are down 19% this year, have hit the two companies. XOM and CVX have traded sideways for the better part of three years.
Big Pharma Earnings
Novartis (NVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and AbbVie (ABBV) will report their third-quarter results this coming week. Investors will be watching closely to hear their plans for entering drug-pricing deals with the Trump administration to stave off the possibility of a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports. The week kicks off with Novartis before the open on Tuesday. Analysts call for 11% earnings growth to $2.29 a share and $13.9 billion in sales, up 8%. Eli Lilly and Merck are both due to post their earnings reports early Thursday. For Lilly, the Street is watching for strong growth from tirzepatide-based products Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro, the diabetes drug, is expected to generate $5.45 billion in sales, growing 75%. Weight-loss drug Zepbound is projected to bring in nearly $3.5 billion in sales, up a whopping 178% year over year. For Merck, the key drug to watch is Keytruda. Keytruda sales are expected to increase 10% to almost $8.2 billion, nearly half of total revenue. Early Friday, AbbVie is expected to report $15.58 billion in sales, with much of that coming from immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But analysts project a 41% decline in earnings.
Biogen, Alnylam Earnings Due
Biotech behemoths Biogen (BIIB) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) will report Q3 results early Thursday. Analysts expect Biogen to come in with adjusted profit of $3.87 a share and $2.34 billion in sales, dipping 5% each. The Street is keeping a close eye on Biogen's Friedreich's ataxia drug Skyclarys. While small at a projected $140 million, sales could grow a bullish 37%. Alnylam, whose stock recently broke out, is forecast to earn 57 cents per share, flipping from a year-earlier loss of 87 cents per share, with sales up nearly 92% to $960 million.
In Brief
EBay (EBAY) will report third-quarter results Wednesday, as shares near a new breakout as part of a strong 2025 advance. Analysts are looking for a 12% rise in adjusted earnings to $1.33 per share, according to FactSet. Sales are seen rising 6% to $2.73 billion. EBay has leaned on AI tools and a focus on ""enthusiast buyers"" to accelerate sales growth.
GeneDx (WGS) is due to report its third-quarter earnings before the market opens Tuesday. Analysts call for the diagnostics company to earn 42 cents a share, minus some items, on $104.6 million in sales. Earnings would skyrocket 950% year over year, as sales climb nearly 37%.
Guardant Health (GH) will report its third-quarter earnings early Wednesday. The cancer-screening player is projected to lose 79 cents per share and report $235.6 million in sales. Losses would narrow slightly year over year, while sales rise 23%.
PayPal (PYPL) reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 28. Analysts estimate that the digital payments firm will report flat EPS with revenue rising 5% to $8.235 billion.
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) is expected to report a 9% EPS gain to $1.79 late Monday. Analysts expect sales for the maker of electronic design software to climb 9% to $1.32 billion.
Celestica (CLS) will post Q3 results late Monday. Wall Street expects the contract electronics manufacturer to earn $1.49 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $3.04 billion, up 21.5%.
Quanta Services (PWR) will report early Thursday, with earnings expected to rise 19.5% to $3.25 per share, up 19.5%, and sales increasing 14% to $7.404 billion. Analysts see a Q3 backlog of $29.372 billion for Quanta, which specializes in building electric plants and provides power grid services. Investors will be looking for comments on data-center growth and other drivers.

AAPL,Pre-markets Soar on Softer CPI Numbers,,"Friday, October 24, 2025

Pre-market futures had rocketed higher upon the long-awaited release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning, which actually showed inflation metrics tick DOWN slightly, instead of work their way higher, as they had done in previous months. The Dow moved from +87 points immediately ahead of the release to +210 points now, the S&P 500 went from +23 to +41, and the Nasdaq shot up from +125 points to +222 points at this hour.

Market participants had been trusting economic figures to remain subdued during these 3 1/2 weeks of a government shutdown, and their wish came true with September CPI numbers this morning: -10 basis points (bps) on CPI month over month (+0.3% vs +0.4%) and core month over month (+0.2% vs +0.3%). Headline CPI on a monthly basis has had a tendency to bounce around a bit lately — August was +0.4%, May -0.1% — but the yearly numbers have told a different story.

The Inflation Rate (CPI year over year headline) ticked up to +3.0% for the first time since January, but 10 bps lower than anticipated. And core CPI year over year came down (10 bps to +3.0%) for the first time since May. We haven’t seen an Inflation Rate above +3% since May of 2024 — when numbers were moving downward at a steady clip. But on core — stripping out volatile food and energy prices — this is the first downward move since March of this year.

The bottom line is this: inflation looks softer on this metric. This will make it easier for the Fed to cut rates 25 bps next week, and forecast another cut at its final meeting of 2025. Should these cuts come to pass, we’ll be 3.50-3.75% as of December — the lowest level in three years. This is not only helping market futures rise but bond yields come down 20 bps from a month ago.

Quarterly Earnings at a Glance: P&G, General Dynamics & More

Quickly, we see more earnings reports of note this morning to finish the trading week. Procter & Gamble PG beat expectations on fiscal Q1 earnings by 9 cents (+4.74%) to $1.99 per share, and the stock is up +2.7% in this strong pre-market. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.

Military equipment major General Dynamics GD took its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating into today’s Q3 report and beat on earnings by +4% — $3.88 per share versus $3.72 in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up +4.25% on the news thus far. For more on GD’s earnings, click here.

Even more impressive this morning is the Q3 earnings report from HCA Healthcare HCA this morning. Earnings of $6.96 per share swept past the $5.65 expected, for a +23.2% positive surprise. Shares of the mid-level hospital operator qare up +4.35% in today’s pre-market. For more on HCA’s earnings, click here.

What to Expect from the Market Next Week

This morning’s CPI data reinforced the notion that the Fed is going to cut interest rates next week by 25 bps to below 4% for the first time in three years. It would be hard to come up with a stronger narrative ahead of next week than that. Had CPI data come in hotter than expected, no doubt we’d be focusing on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell & Co. must be considering.

Q3 earnings season hits full throttle next week, peaking mid-week with over 300 companies posting quarterly numbers Wednesday and even more on Thursday. Among these will include “Mag 7” members Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL — both Wednesday after the close — and Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN Thursday afternoon.

AAPL,"Stocks to watch next week: Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Shell",,"Five of the ""Magnificent 7"" tech giants are due to report in the coming week, along with a raft of other major companies across different sectors.

Tesla (TSLA) kicked off this quarter's Mag 7 results on Wednesday, with Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) company missing against expectations on earnings, despite reporting record sales for Q3 earlier this month. While revenue of $28.01bn in the third quarter topped expectations of $26.27, per Bloomberg, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50 came in just shy of estimates of $0.54.

The disappointing start to Mag 7 earnings adds to a broader air of caution around tech stocks over increasing nervousness that an AI bubble may have formed in markets.

""We’re at a critical juncture for markets with growing concerns about the risk of an AI bubble,"" said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""Therefore, a lot riding on earnings season particularly from the tech giants that have been investing heavily in AI and driving most of the wider market gains.""

Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Meta (META) are due to report on Wednesday, followed by Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) on Thursday.

In addition to US big tech, major companies that are due to report include oil major Shell (SHEL.L), which has already said it expects much stronger trading in its gas division in the third quarter.

Here's more on what to look out for:

Microsoft (MSFT) – Reports first quarter earnings on Wednesday 29 October

Expectations are high going into Microsoft's first quarter results, according to IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp, who said that analyst consensus is looking for revenue of $64.51bn (£48.47bn) and EPS of $3.11.

However, he said that the tech company has a strong track record of beating expectations, having topped EPS estimates for eight consecutive quarters.

""Revenue forecasts have also proven conservative, with the company surpassing top-line expectations in its last eight quarters,"" said Beauchamp. ""This pattern suggests analysts may be underestimating Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to monetise its AI investments.""

As Microsoft's (MSFT) capital expenditure has continued to grow as it builds out its AI infrastructure, Beauchamp said that investors ""will be keen to understand how quickly these investments generate returns"".

He said that profitability from Microsoft's (MSFT) cloud business remained the ""most important metric for investors to watch"". On the company's earnings call, he said that management's commentary around operating margins ""will reveal whether AI investments are beginning to pay off or continue to weigh on profitability"".

Beauchamp said that adoption trends around Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure cloud computing platform, particularly in AI-related services, ""deserve close attention"" and that the monetisation of its Copilot AI assistant tool will also be in focus.

Shares in Microsoft (MSFT) are up 23.5% year-to-date, outperforming a 14% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in that time.

The stock rose after Microsoft's (MSFT) previous earnings release in July, with the company topping expectations in the fourth quarter, reporting adjusted EPS of $3.65 versus a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $3.37 and revenue of $76.44bn versus forecasts of $73.89bn.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) – Reports third quarter earnings on Wednesday 29 October

In a busy week of news for Alphabet's Google, the tech giant struck a deal worth ""tens of billions"" of dollars with AI safety and research company Anthropic, according to an announcement on Thursday. The partnership will see Google Cloud supply up to one million of its AI chips to Anthropic, helping expand the startup's compute resources.

On Wednesday, Google said it had made a breakthrough in quantum computing using its Willow quantum chip. The tech company said it had developed an algorithm, called Quantum Echoes, that it said ""runs 13,000 times faster on Willow than the best classical algorithm on one of the world’s fastest supercomputers"".

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) shares dipped earlier this week after OpenAI unveiled its new AI-powered browser ChatGPT Atlas, putting it in competition with Google's Chrome.

However, the stock continues to trade at close to an all-time high, with shares up nearly 34% year-to-date.

In the second quarter, Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings came in at $2.31 per share compared to a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18. Revenue was $96.43bn versus estimates of $93.97bn.

In a note on 20 October, Bank of America (BAC) analysts reiterated their ""buy"" rating on the stock and raised their price objective on the stock from $252 per share to $280.

The analysts said they expected Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) to report revenue of $86bn for the quarter and EPS of $2.17.

""We expect another quarter of strong search results (and stable paid click growth) and, while macro driven, could further alleviate AI disruption risk and aid multiple expansion,"" the analysts said, adding that they ""expect management to highlight recent Gemini usage momentum"".

""On Cloud side, recent deals could aid backlog growth and we remain constructive on the segment's increasing value contribution for stock,"" they added.

Meta Platforms (META) – Reports third quarter earnings on Wednesday 29 October

Facebook-owner Meta (META) is cutting around 600 roles in its AI division in an effort to streamline operations, according to multiple reports on Wednesday.

However, the layoffs will reportedly not impact the company's new TBD Lab, which includes many of the firm's recent multimillion-dollar hires. A spokesperson for Meta had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.

Meta (META) went on a hiring spree this summer, luring in top AI talent with bumper pay packages, as the company continues to invest heavily in the technology.

The company said in its second quarter results that it expected capital expenditure for the year to be in the range of $66bn to $72bn, up from previous guidance of $64bn to $72bn.

Meta (META) chief financial officer Susan Li said that the company expected ""another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.""

Bank of America (BAC) analysts said in a note on 21 October that they expected updates on Meta's (META) AI outlook to be the focus of the company's earnings call and will be ""critical for sentiment"".

The analysts maintained their ""buy"" rating on the stock and said that they expected Meta (META) to report third quarter revenue of $50bn and EPS of $7.30.

""Checks suggest potential upside driven by improving macro, accelerating AI benefits, and higher sector ad spend to backfill softer organic Google traffic,"" they said.

Meta (META) shares surged after releasing its second quarter results at the end of July, which beat expectations. The company also offered a better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter, guiding to revenue of $47.5bn to $50.5bn, which was well ahead of the $46.2bn forecast on Wall Street.

Bank of America's (BAC) analysts said that they expected Meta (META) to guide revenue of $55.5bn to $59bn for the fourth quarter.

Shares are up more than 25% year-to-date and are trading near all-time highs.

Apple (AAPL) – Reports fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 October

Shares in Apple (AAPL) hit a fresh high, seeing the company close in on $4tn market valuation, following a report which showed strong sales of its recently released iPhone 17. The report from Counterpoint Research said that initial iPhone 17 sales have outpaced iPhone 16 sales in the US and China.

The stock has recovered from choppiness throughout the year, but is trading just under 4% in the green year-to-date, having come under pressure from US president Donald Trump's tariffs.

Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook warned in the company's third-quarter earnings call that tariffs may add $1.1bn to costs in its fiscal fourth quarter.

Interactive Investor's Scholar said that ""Cook has been more involved in politics this year than he probably would have liked, finding himself stuck right at the centre of the US-China trade war"".

""Cook is faced with the unwanted and rather daunting balancing act of trying to keep US President Trump onside, without jeopardising Apple's (AAPL) long-term dependence on China for manufacturing,"" she said. ""This month Cook pledged to continue investing in China while earlier this year he also promised to invest $100bn in US manufacturing.""

Despite tariff headwinds, Apple (AAPL) shares rose after releasing its third quarter results, which bested estimates on the top and bottom lines, thanks to better-than-anticipated iPhone sales.

For the quarter, Apple (AAPL) reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.57 on revenue of $94bn. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $1.43 on revenue of $89.22bn, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

In the fourth quarter, Scholar said that Refinitiv data showed Apple (AAPL) is expected to post revenue of $102bn and EPS of $1.77.

In addition to the company's tariff burden, Scholar said that investors ""will also be looking for any clues into what Apple (AAPL) is doing in terms of AI investments as the tech giant looks to play catch up in the generative AI race.""

""Ahead of Apple's (AAPL) earnings, the company has enjoyed some price target upgrades from the analyst community including from Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs,"" she said. ""A strong set of earnings could propel Apple to a valuation of $4tn for the first time.""

Amazon (AMZN) – Reports third quarter results on Thursday 30 October

Amazon was in the spotlight this week after Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major outage on Monday, which impacted companies and organisations around the world, knocking out websites and apps for millions.

AJ Bell's (AJB.L) investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth highlighted that the AWS cloud computing service ""continues to be the biggest source of Amazon’s (AMZN) profits and analysts will look to the trend here"" in its third quarter results.

""Analysts and shareholders will look for any comment on how the AWS outage this month may affect fourth-quarter and full-year figures,"" they added.

Amazon's (AMZN) second quarter results beat expectations, with EPS topping $1.68 the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.33, while net sales of $167.7bn were also ahead of an anticipated $162.15bn.

For the third quarter, Amazon (AMZN) guided to net sales of $174.0bn and $179.5bn, versus expectations of $173.24bn. However, the company's outlook for third quarter operating income failed to impress, with guidance of between $15.5bn and $20.5bn, versus expectations of $19.42bn.

AJ Bell's investment experts said that analysts anticipate a headline EPS figure of $1.58 for the third quarter.

They said that Amazon (AMZN) provided a ""wide guidance range for the quarter, partly because it has so many moving parts, partly because management seem less fussed about near-term trends and partly because the company is not frightened to invest for the long-term if it feels the need.""

For the fourth quarter, they said that analysts are expecting sales of $208bn and EPS of $1.89.

Shell (SHEL.L) – Reports third quarter results on Thursday 30 October

A third quarter trading update from Shell in early October has already given investors an idea of what to expect from the FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) oil major's full quarterly results on Thursday.

In the update, Shell (SHEL.L) said it expected trading in its gas division to be ""significantly higher"" in the third quarter than in the previous three months.

That's despite the company lowering its production guidance for its integrated natural gas division to between 910,000 and 950,000 barrels of equivalent per day (boe/d) for the third quarter. That compared to a previously guided range of 910,000 to 970,000.

Shell (SHEL.L) forecasted production for upstream oil production in the third quarter to be between 1.79 million to 1.89 million boed. The company said it expected to report a refining margin of $11.60 per barrel in the third quarter, which would be higher than the $8.90 recorded for the previous three months.

However, Shell (SHEL.L) also warned that it expected to take a hit of around $600m relating to the cancellation of a major biofuels project in Rotterdam.

Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that market consensus pointed to revenue of around $73.5bn in the third quarter.

""Share buybacks remain in focus, with Shell (SHEL.L) maintaining $3.5 billion in the second quarter despite earnings pressure,"" he said. ""However, with Brent crude (BZ=F) falling and a persistent global surplus averaging around 1.9 million barrels per day, the sustainability of Shell’s capital returns may come into question if oil prices remain weak.""

Despite a challenging first half, shares are trading 15% in the green year-to-date.

Top 5 Buy Calls:

1. Loop upgrades Apple on “material upside” to iPhone estimates

Loop Capital upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $315, up from $226. Loop’s supply chain checks indicate iPhone shipments will expand through 2027 amid refresh and design cycles, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm sees “material upside” to consensus iPhone estimates through 2027. It believes Apple could be starting three consecutive record iPhone shipment years.

2. Amazon resumed with an Overweight at KeyBanc

KeyBanc resumed coverage of Amazon.com (AMZN) with an Overweight rating and $300 price target. Advertising is fueling gains in the company’s retail business, which provides a path forward for grocery becoming more material over the medium term, the firm tells investors in a research note. Investors have also become too pessimistic on the Cloud business, and the firm sees potential for improving growth into 2026.

3. Block initiated with a Buy at Citi

Citi initiated coverage of Block (XYZ) with a Buy rating and $105 price target. Block has turned the corner and is focused on accelerating growth, the firm tells investors in a research note. The upcoming Investor Day could give color for sustainable gross profit growth and modestly increasing the adjusted operating margins over the mid-term, Citi says.

Block initiated with an Overweight at Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Block with an Overweight rating and $91 price target. The firm, which started coverage on 20 stocks in the Payments, Processors & IT Services sector, says the Payments space has suffered from rotation to AI-centric stocks, as well as multiple instances of subpar execution by various companies, but Citi thinks “too many stocks have been painted with the same brush.” The Payments sector has “been a minefield for investors,” but the firm sees some “particularly attractive opportunities,” the firm added.

4. eBay upgraded to Outperform at Citizens JMP

Citizens JMP upgraded eBay (EBAY) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $115 price target. The firm believes the company’s product initiatives are creating a “significantly better consumer experience” in its focus categories that can drive mid-single-digit merchandise volume growth in 2026. eBay is seeing a greater share of listings and reinforcing category flywheels, Citizens JMP tells investors in a research note. In addition, the firm thinks eBay’s core marketplace can remain the driver of this business, with artificial intelligence improving product discovery and ease of listings.

5. Capri Holdings upgraded to Outperform at Raymond James

Raymond James upgraded Capri Holdings (CPRI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $25 price target. Capri appears well-positioned for a turnaround following several challenging years, supported by improving demand signals, conservative FY26 guidance, and upside potential to FY27 estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note. Channel checks indicate sequential improvement, and stronger revenue growth and margin expansion could drive FY27 EPS meaningfully above current consensus, Raymond says.

Top 5 Sell Calls:

1. Rivian downgraded to Underperform at Mizuho

Mizuho downgraded Rivian (RIVN) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $10, down from $14. The firm cites slowing electric vehicle demand as Inflation Reduction Act credits expire for the downgrade. Mizuho sees headwinds in 2026 for Rivian due to with softer auto sales in North America and China risks. It cut Rivian’s 2026 deliveries forecast to 60,000 units from 68,000, below the consensus of 72,000.

2. Molina Healthcare downgraded to Underweight at Barclays

Barclays downgraded Molina Healthcare (MOH) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $144, down from $185. The firm thinks the company’s preliminary 2026 earnings per share outlook of $14 is “too optimistic,” assuming its Medicaid medical loss ratio will be flat year-over-year. Despite Molina’s “disappointing” Q3 results and corresponding stock selloff, there remains downside risk to forward estimates, Barclays tells investors in a research note. The firm views the company’s building Medicaid pressure in the second half of 2025 as a “clear negative development” for 2026.

3. Progressive downgraded to Underweight at Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley downgraded Progressive (PGR) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $214, down from $265. The firm finds Progressive’s bull case less visible when stripping out Florida. Progressive is entering into a softer part of the pricing cycle, which is likely to compress valuation multiples further, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley believes the cyclical nature of the business implies earnings declines in 2026 and 2027.

4. Cleveland-Cliffs downgraded to Underweight at Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo downgraded Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $11. The firm views the stock’s 22% rally on Monday as “excess exuberance.” The rally is an overreaction to a memorandum of understanding with a foreign steel mill and potential rare earth deposits, Wells tells investors in a research note. The firm considers Cleveland-Cliffs a beneficiary of a U.S. spot sheet price rebound into year end, but thinks the shares now more than reflect a better 2026.

“When the Fed is lowering rates and earnings are good, markets don’t go down very much,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer at Crossmark Global Investments. “That’s where we find ourselves.”

“Earnings drive stocks, and earnings have been pretty good,” Doll said.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their best week since early August. The Dow posted its best week since early July.

“With the Fed cutting rates — and this report does nothing to stop them from a [quarter-point] cut next week — and corporate profits continuing to increase, it’s hard to see an interruption of this year’s bull market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.

Investors next week will be attuned to a slate of corporate earnings from companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). US-China trade will also be in focus as President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.",Yahoo!

AAPL,Stocks See Support from Favorable CPI Report,,"The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is up +0.76%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is up +0.85%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +1.04%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) are up +0.70%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) are up +0.82%.

Stock indexes are trading higher after today’s slightly weaker-than-expected US CPI report gave the Fed a bit more latitude to cut interest rates. The Sep CPI report of +0.3% m/m and +3.0% y/y was slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.4% m/m and +3.1% y/y. Also, the Sep core CPI report of +0.3% m/m and +3.1% y/y was slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.1% y/y.

While the markets reacted favorably to today’s CPI report, the Sep CPI report of +3.0% y/y rose to match the current 16-month high, and the core CPI report of +3.0% y/y was still far above the Fed’s inflation target of +2.0%.

Stocks also saw support from today’s Oct S&P US manufacturing PMI report of +0.2 to 52.2, stronger than expectations of unchanged at 52.0. Also, the Oct S&P US services PMI report of +1.0 to 55.2 was stronger than expectations for a -0.7 point decline to 53.5.

On the negative side, today’s final-Oct University of Michigan US consumer sentiment index fell -1.4 points to 53.6, which was weaker than market expectations of a -0.5 point drop to 54.5.

Stocks were undercut when President Trump late Thursday announced he had terminated trade negotiations with Canada, citing an anti-tariff advertisement released by the provincial government of Ontario that apparently hit a nerve with Mr. Trump. The ad featured former US President Reagan speaking out in a 1987 address in favor of free trade and against tariffs, calling tariffs an outdated idea that stifles innovation, drives up prices, and hurts US workers.

Mr. Trump claimed the ad was deceptive and said it was designed to influence the US Supreme Court ahead of oral arguments on November 5 on the legality of Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Lower courts have already deemed Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs illegal, ruling the tariffs are based on a specious claim of emergency authority. If the US Supreme Court upholds those rulings, the US government will have to refund the tariffs already collected, and Mr. Trump’s power to impose tariffs will be limited to well-founded sections of US trade law.

The markets are focused on US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The US government shutdown continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown is delaying the release of government reports, including the last four weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets are focused on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Positive corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

Overseas stock markets on Friday are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.06%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.71%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.35%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) are up +1 tick, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -0.8 bp at 3.993%. T-notes rebounded from early losses on the slightly weaker-than-expected US CPI report. Also, the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate today is down -0.9 bp at 2.294%.

T-notes have ongoing support from the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

The markets are discounting a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

European government bond yields are higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +4.5 bp at 2.627%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +0.4 bp at 4.427%.

Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

US Stock Movers

The Magnificent Seven stocks today are mostly trading higher, except for a -2% decline in Tesla (TSLA) and a small decline in Meta Platforms (META). Notable gainers include a +2.8% gain in Alphabet (GOOG), and gains of more than 1% in Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN).

Chip stocks are broadly higher today, supporting gains in tech stocks and the overall market. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +6%, and Micron Technology (MU) is up more than 4%. Broadcom (AVGO), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Lam Research (LRCX) are up more than +3%. Intel (INTC) is up +0.6% on a favorable earnings report and strong revenue guidance.

Crypto stocks are seeing support today with Bitcoin up +0.9% and Ethereum up +2.3%. Also, Coinbase (COIN) is up more than +7% on an upgrade from JPMorgan to overweight from neutral due to some risk abatement and increasing monetization opportunities. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is up more than +5%, and MARA Holdings (MARA) is up more than +3%.

Ford (F) is up more than +11% after beating analyst earnings expectations and expressing optimism about a bounce-back from a disruptive fire at a major supplier.

Newmont (NEM) is down more than -4% after the company said that gold production in 2026 may be no higher than 2025.

Deckers Outdoor (DECK) is down more than -12% after reporting disappointing 2026 net sales.

Transcript

Rena Sherbill: Brian Stewart, our Director of news at Seeking Alpha, always great to talk to you on these Wall Street Roundups. Welcome back to another week.

Brian Stewart: Great to be here.

RS: We've got a government shutdown that still exists. We've got some tariff news with Canada. We've got major earnings. Where should we start this week?

BS: It's funny. I kinda forgot about the government shutdown. It's so pushed to the background.

I think this week has all been about earnings getting revved up. Tesla (TSLA) obviously, the headliner just in terms of the profile the company has, though the earnings themselves were neither here nor there.

The stock was up about 2% after earnings. It missed on its bottom line, and its margin shrank, but revenue was up 12% and beat expectations.

The company warned that it's facing near term uncertainty with shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, though I think we all knew that.

So that wasn't really new information, though slightly noteworthy that the company felt the need to to acknowledge that.

I think in general, people took the Tesla report as fine, a step on the way of the comeback that started after Musk returned to full time duties after the DOGE experiment.

So I think investors are basically in a wait and see mode. The stock has already recovered quite a bit from what it lost during the DOGE situation.

And so I think really they're just looking to the future and and I think deliveries are gonna matter and production's gonna matter as those reports come out in the coming months.

RS: And there's many more companies to get into when it comes to earnings. What else would you put on that list?

BS: As long as we're talking EVs, (GM) is an interesting one.

It popped 15% after its earnings. It beat expectations, raised guidance. The fundamental lesson from that was that the tariff impact was not as bad as the company expected. Meanwhile, GM has been increasing its market share.

It reached its highest market share since 2017. So the company's executing well. There's worries of an EV demand softening as people went out and bought EVs as the tax credit was expiring.

And so there's there's a worry, and this is something that could impact Tesla as well. There's a worry that this sort of packed the channel in that regard. But overall, investors were very upbeat about GM's report. And it just goes to show that the car industry is more than just Tesla.

And then on the downside, the big loser, at least among the headline stocks, was Netflix (NFLX).

It dropped 10% after its earnings. Revenue rose 17% from last year, beating expectations where the company took a 600,000,000 charge related to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. It also saw some margin decline.

I think that margin decline is probably more of a worry than the Brazilian tax situation which will resolve itself eventually. It's kind of a near term hurdle, but not really an existential threat to the company.

I think investors are probably a little bit more worried about margins shrinking a little bit.

RS: We had Hardika Singh on from Fundstrat on Investing Experts this past week on Sunday. And she was talking about how there's such an opportunity to be buying the dip these days as the stock market moves in, let's say, unprecedented ways and things that are sometimes hard to understand, but the opportunities are there.

And as you mentioned Netflix, Cathie Wood, she added, she bought the dip on Netflix. Anything to say there or what you're seeing from market participants or anything to note about Cathie's position or any other large positions that are being taken there or anything else to note with Netflix?

BS: I think you're getting at the fundamental debate that's going on in the market right now. I think a lot of people are worried that the market as a whole and the AI stocks specifically are gonna turn into a pumpkin sometime soon.

It's gonna strike midnight, and we're all gonna find ourselves running without shoes on, if that metaphor stretches that far. I mean, Cathie Wood is a super bull, always has been.

So I don't know, she's looking long term, right? I mean, her idea is that these stocks are going to sort of change the fundamental way in which we do business and live our lives.

And so I don't know how much she's factoring in near term factors like tariffs and things like that. So I think that goes to the heart of the debate, to what your horizon is.

I mean, if you have a 10 horizon, certainly there's opportunities to get stocks pretty cheaply. Now, if you have a much more near term, if you're more of a trader, there are a lot of worries out there.

And so that's the I think the question that's being asked is when a stock like Netflix drops 10%, is that the start of a bubble bursting or is that the best opportunity you're going to get for the next foreseeable future to buy that stock?

RS: And to the point of long term investing in that space, Dan Rayburn, an expert in the media and streaming space, he writes and speaks a lot outside of Seeking Alpha. We've had him on a few times on Investing Experts. And the last episode he was on, we called it Netflix is Still King. He espouses a bullish long term perspective on that.

We saw results from Intel (INTC) on Thursday. What would you say about that? Tech obviously top of mind for many investors as it has such a large effect on the rest of the market.

BS: Last check today, the company reported last night, stock is up about 2%.

It had strong results and guidance. People see this as signs that the turnaround at Intel is proceeding a pace. There are still worries about valuation and worries about execution.

The stock has rallied significantly recently. It's up 57% since NVIDIA (NVDA) announced its investment in mid September. So it's had a huge upswing over the past few weeks, a very short period of time.

And so now I think it's a matter of investors in a show me kind of mood. So we'll see in the coming quarters whether Intel can turn what seems to be a switch in momentum for the company into real bottom line results.

RS: Any other stock specific highlights that you would share with listeners?

BS: Just to straying off of earnings a little bit, I think it's worth it as we talk about the debate around whether or not we're in a bubble.

Beyond Meat (BYND) had a a meme stock moment this past week. So it jumped from 52¢ at the close of last Thursday to $3.62 on Tuesday. It hit $7.69 along the way.

There was some news to kind of sprinkle in there and drive the stock. It had an expanded deal with Walmart (WMT), but this was mostly a short squeeze meme stock situation, and there were sizable gains.

I mean, nothing in the the hundreds of percentage points that you saw from Beyond Meat, but Krispy Kreme (DNUT), GoPro (GPRO), iRobot (IRBT), also substantial. And these were all sort of the cluster of meme stocks that have emerged in 2025.

So I think if you're skeptical about the market in general, I think situations like this raise a red flag when you see frothy situations like that.

If your argument is that we're in a bubble, then these kind of situations pop up and it shows that there's there's kind of a a lack of rationality in the market.

I think a bull would just say we've had meme stocks going on through the twenty twenties. It's just part of the market at this point. Every once in a while, this stuff is gonna bubble up, and you can't really make longer term decisions based on how often this is happening.

RS: Hardika had another point in that episode about the meme stock ETF (MEME) that it just recently came back on board. So I think reflective of that point for sure.

I mentioned the government shutdown at the beginning. You said you weren't very focused on it, but we have had a dearth of data as we've talked about because of that shutdown.

We did get the CPI report this week. Some bullishness if you wanna dive into that pool. What would you say about that report or economic data in general these days?

BS: That's a good point about the economic data, especially we're theoretically two weeks away from getting the next jobs report.

Pretty skeptical that's gonna happen. I think there were headlines today that the next CPI report is in danger as well. So this might be the last CPI that we get for some period of time.

But pretty much in line with what people were expecting, the inflation rate, the core CPI was 3%, which is where we sort of settled.

Officially, the Fed is still targeting a 2% inflation rate, but I think there's sort of an understanding that 3% is fine. You know, like, we wish we had 2%, but we'll settle for 3%.

So the biggest thing in the economic calendar next week is the Fed decision. Everyone pretty much expects the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points. That's pretty much baked in 97% chance if you look at the trading so far.

Also, another rate cut is expected for December. It's roughly fifty fifty if there's gonna be a third rate cut in January. So people are expecting the Fed to take these stair steps lower in the next several meetings.

And so as long as inflation doesn't spike anywhere beyond sort of that 3% range, I think that rate cutting situation is going to unfold as the market expects.

RS: We've got some major earnings coming next week to continue with the crux of earning season. What would you highlight for investors?

BS: I think an interesting dichotomy to look at is Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Meta (META), both AI plays, both coming out next week.

So its last earnings reports, it spiked 11% in the day after the earnings, but has since drifted off that level. So it's down about 5% from that post earnings jump.

Basically, there's a valuation worry at Meta. There's also a spending concern. It's sort of a habit at Meta to push a lot of chips in the middle when it sees an idea that happened with the metaverse and now it's happening with AI.

And so the question is whether these bets are going to to pay off. I mean, the core business, the Facebook business, the social media business has been extremely strong.

And the question is, did the cash that it's investing from these businesses into the new businesses, are those eventually going to fall to the bottom line?

And so that's gonna be what people have their eye on in Meta. So there was like a a rush of enthusiasm after the last earnings report, which was extremely strong, and then a caution that set in afterwards.

Meanwhile, Google, after it released its last earnings report, which is also extremely strong, it largely received a shrug.

The stock didn't move much at all after that earnings report. However, the stock has been making its way higher ever since. So it's up about 36% since that last earnings report.

So the opposite reaction to Meta where there was sort of a indifference to the the actual earnings report, but then kind of a drift up as enthusiasm grew over the past several months.

So it'll be interesting to see when Google's report comes out, when Alphabet's report comes out, whether or not the results can justify the enthusiasm that's now been priced in.

RS: Anything else to add earnings wise or next week wise?

BS: We've got Apple (AAPL) coming out. The new iPhone came out, so there there might be some commentary on that.

Though I think probably the next quarter will be the key one for that. Another interesting thing about Apple is Apple is up only about 5% this year and only turned positive for the year in September.

It's another stock that slipped a little after its last earnings report in July and it's up about 30% since then. So like Alphabet, it's sort of seen a growing enthusiasm over the past several months.

In Apple's case, part of the upside that it has seen is that it made a $100,000,000,000 manufacturing commitment to the US, which was seen as a hedge against the tariff situation.

So Apple's pretty exposed to the trade tensions between China and the US, So that $100,000,000,000 commitment is seen as a way to get an exemption if in fact those tariffs really bite down on the company.

It saw a boost in the August, September time frame as that worry, the tariff worry, seemed to get relieved.

And then Microsoft (MSFT) is also reporting next week, a company that also is an AI play. Look at the Azure numbers as that come out, the cloud numbers.

It saw 26% growth in its cloud business last quarter, which was up from 21% in the previous quarter and 20% the year before. So it stepped up to a higher growth plane with that last quarter. I think the question is whether it's going to continue to see that higher growth rate or whether it's gonna retreat back to where it was before.",Seeking Alpha,2025-10-24T17:25:00Z,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833230-wall-street-roundup-are-we-in-a-bubble,0.9999999999999999,2025-10-25 13:49:53.288050,,0.1843137254901961

AAPL,"Assessing Apple's Performance Against Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals Industry - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)",,"In the dynamic and fiercely competitive business environment, conducting a thorough analysis of companies is crucial for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will perform an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to offer valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.

Apple Background

Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.

After a detailed analysis of Apple, the following trends become apparent:

The Price to Earnings ratio of 39.39 is 0.73x lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock.

With a Price to Book ratio of 58.52, which is 5.71x the industry average, Apple might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers.

The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.59, surpassing the industry average by 2.69x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.

The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 35.34%, which is 29.55% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.

Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $31.03 Billion, which is 86.19x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.

Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.72 Billion, which indicates 47.01x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

AAPL,Deploy Cash - Cooler CPI Provides Fuel For Stock Market To Move Higher - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),,"Deploy Cash

Our model has given a signal to deploy cash. The trigger for this move is cooler than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI). In our protection band, cash is being reduced by 3%.

Cooler CPI

Note the following:

The chart shows buying in the stock market after the release of CPI data.

The chart shows that during the recent pullback the stock market did not even touch the top band of zone 1 (support) before bouncing. This indicates a stock market that wants to go higher.

The chart shows the magnet for stock market traders.

After cooler than expected CPI data, the probability of a move to the magnet has increased. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.

Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.

In our analysis, here are the probabilities of future rate cuts after CPI data:

President Trump is traveling to the APEC Summit in Korea. He is expected to meet with China’s President Xi on Thursday next week.

President Trump is optimistic about reaching a deal with China. In addition to the overall trade, of special interest are soybeans and rare earth minerals.

President Trump is expected to sign trade deals with 12 companies.

The FOMC meeting will start on Tuesday next week. The rate decision will be announced on Wednesday.

In our analysis, here are the bullish factors investors should be looking at:

The pattern of the momo crowd is to buy ahead of the Fed rate decision. The probability is high that the pattern will repeat.

Expect President Trump to continue making positive statements about the upcoming meeting with President Xi.

President Trump has an incentive to spin the results of the meeting with President Xi as positive even if China stands firm.

The momo crowd may try to front run the Trump Xi meeting.

Blind money will flow into the stock market on the first two days of November.

If the stock market starts moving higher, expect year end chase by money managers.

It is important for investors to think both in strategic and tactical terms. All of the foregoing positives are tactical in nature.

From a strategic point of view, substantial risks remain. These risks include the following:

The Fed's inflation target is 2%. 3% is significantly higher than 2%.

Inflation can easily resurge.

Valuations are very high.

At some point, there will be over investment in AI.

China is not going to give up its quest to replace the U.S. as the world's superpower. In substance, any agreement with China that is cast as positive is likely, in reality, to be hollow.

There is no solution in sight to $1.8T in budget deficit and $38T in national debt.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

AAPL,Apple Stock Soars -- Why It Can Go Higher,,"Key Points

Revenue accelerated in Apple's most recent quarter.

iPhone 17 demand is reportedly very strong.

Apple's high-margin services business continues to grow at double-digit rates.

10 stocks we like better than Apple ›

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares have rallied sharply from lows earlier this year. Shares traded below $180 during the tariff scare in April, and the stock largely stayed below $210 through August. Recently, however, shares pushed to record territory above $260 as investors digested impressive fiscal third-quarter results and the well-received launch of the iPhone 17 line-up.

Ultimately, the Cupertino-based iPhone maker is benefiting from a healthier core business and a product cycle that finally looks like a tailwind again. For investors wondering whether to trim after the run-up, doing so could be a mistake.

Here are five reasons I'm bullish on Apple stock -- even after its recent run-up.

1. Recent results are moving in the right direction

Revenue in the quarter ended Jun. 28 (fiscal Q3) increased 10% year over year to about $94.0 billion. That compares with just 5% growth in the March quarter.

Even more, Apple's momentum in fiscal Q3 was in the areas investors watch closely. The period's iPhone sales rose about 13% to about $44.6 billion. Additionally, services revenue increased about 13% to a record $27.4 billion.

Apple also said every geographic segment grew in the June quarter. That was not the case earlier in the fiscal year.

2. Improving profitability

Earnings per share rose even faster than revenue during the quarter. The key per-share profitability metric rose 12% year over year to $1.57. Share count reduction helped, but the bigger driver was higher gross profit dollars from iPhone and services.

Total gross margin reached 46.5%, up slightly from a year ago. This was despite product margin facing tariff costs that pressured profitability. Meanwhile, Apple's services gross margin remained far higher than both Apple's product gross margin and its overall gross margin. This is important because Apple's services business generally grows faster than its products business, so the high-margin segment will likely have a growing impact on the company's overall profitability.

3. A cash cow

Apple closed the quarter with about $133 billion in cash and marketable securities and roughly $92 billion of term debt. That balance sheet, combined with the company's robust free cash flow (trailing-12-months free cash flow was $96.2 billion) gives the company flexibility to keep funding both investment and capital returns.

Indeed, the board authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program in May and lifted the quarterly dividend 4% to $0.26. In addition, the company has committed to investing $600 billion in jobs, manufacturing, supplier partnerships, and other expenditures in the U.S. -- investments that will likely help fuel Apple's future growth.

4. iPhone 17 strength

Recent research from research firm Counterpoint suggests that iPhone 17 demand is significantly ahead of last year's cycle in the U.S. and China. If this turns out to be true, Apple could maintain its recent return to double-digit growth in iPhone sales in the coming quarters.

Apple's new iPhone lineup has been well-received, making many analysts more optimistic about the stock. Not only is the entry-level iPhone 17 packed with value, but there are differentiating factors for the flagship iPhone 17 Pro lineup, too, including significant camera upgrades and a bold new orange color. And then there's an entirely new iPhone priced between these two: the iPhone Air. It sports an overhauled form factor that focuses on durability and thinness.

5. An attractive valuation

While shares aren't cheap, they're not expensive either. The stock trades at 32 times forward earnings. And combining both the quality of Apple's business with the fact that it is inflecting in recent quarters, it makes sense to pay up for a reasonable valuation.

A strong iPhone sales cycle and margin expansion as its high-margin services segment grows as a percent of overall revenue should help Apple live up to this multiple.

Of course, there are some key risks. Tariffs weighed on product margin in the June quarter, and management estimated about $1.1 billion of tariff costs in the current quarter. Additionally, while Apple's revenue in Greater China started recovering in fiscal Q3, it could weaken again. Given how dependent Apple is on the segment, investors need to watch iPhone sales in the market closely.

Overall, the stock looks good -- even at its higher valuation. Revenue growth accelerated from fiscal Q2 to fiscal Q3, and a strong iPhone 17 could help the company's revenue growth accelerate even more. In addition, Apple's fast-growing services segment is a key tailwind that should persist for years to come.

AAPL,OpenAI's new Sora 2 video generation app went viral. Is it a real threat to Meta?,,"Meta is facing new pressure from OpenAI, the juggernaut behind ChatGPT, which is now making waves in short-form video with its viral hit, Sora 2. The new app combines AI-powered video generation with a social feed that mimics TikTok and Instagram Reels. Less than five days after its Sept. 30 launch , Sora 2 racked up over a million iOS downloads for Apple devices, despite being invite-only. That pace outstripped downloads for the ChatGPT app when it launched in May 2023, six months after the AI chatbot debuted on web browsers, marking the start of its historic rise in popularity . Sora 2 spent three weeks at No. 1 on Apple's App Store, before being supplanted this week by the Dave's Hot Chicken china, due to a promotional push with rapper Drake . Still, it's No. 2 as of Friday morning. The threat to Meta: If Sora 2 proves to have staying power, it could chip away at Meta's most valuable asset – the time people spend scrolling and posting on Facebook and Instagram, which makes those apps indispensable destinations for advertisers. Meta is projected to earn $192 billion in ad revenue in 2025 alone. For Meta, eyeballs equal dollars because nearly all of its revenue comes from advertising. ""This isn't the end of the Instagram-Facebook momentum,"" said analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson in an interview with CNBC. ""But if investors see this as a threat, it may limit how much they're willing to pay towards the premium for Meta,"" added Nathanson, who maintains a buy rating and $890 price target on Meta stock. That implies about 21% upside from Thursday's close. Meta shares have declined almost 1% since the day before Sora 2's debut, part of a multimonth slump for the stock. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained more than 2% in the three-plus weeks following Sora 2's arrival, and it's advanced roughly 10% in the past three months. Nathanson believes investor anxiety is growing, and that any perceived disruption to Meta's ""engagement flywheel"" – and its advertising dollars – could sour investor sentiment fast. While Nathanson remains bullish on Meta shares, he said his decades as an analyst have taught him to keep an open mind on changes in consumer behavior. In general, ""investors start to worry about the long-term sustainability of business models,"" Nathanson added. ""And if you see a potential new competitor emerging, then people would pay a lower multiple for future earnings."" META YTD mountain Meta Platforms YTD It's a familiar storyline for tech investors. ChatGPT's explosive growth following its late 2022 debut became a significant overhang on shares of Google-parent Alphabet , as investors questioned the durability of Google's search empire in the face of a conversational competitor. ""People were really worried about the future earnings power of Alphabet,"" Nathanson said. Now, nearly three years later, could Meta be facing its own ChatGPT moment? Or will Sora 2 just be a flash in the pan that fails to weaken Meta's social media supremacy? With Sora 2, users can generate, remix, and put themselves in AI videos using text or images. In addition to being a video generator, it also has a built-in social app. In the app, users can discover new videos in a customizable Sora feed and share them on other social networks. Sora 2 builds on the original Sora model, released in February 2024, with more advanced capabilities that generate more physically accurate and realistic videos. To be sure, OpenAI's surge isn't without friction. Last week, the company halted AI-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr. after users created ""disrespectful depictions"" of the civil rights leader. OpenAI said it's strengthening guardrails for public figures and will allow people or their families to opt out of being included in Sora-generated content. OpenAI doesn't have the AI video turf all to itself. Google has its Veo model , an updated version of which rolled out last week. Days prior to Sora 2's release, Meta debuted Vibes , a new feed on the Meta AI app where users can create and share short-form AI-generated videos. While browsing, users see a range of AI-generated videos that become more personalized over time. With Vibes, users can create their own videos from scratch, work with content they already have, or remix a video from the feed to make it their own. When ready to share, they can post directly to the Vibes feed, direct message to friends, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels. If you see a potential new competitor emerging, then people would pay a lower multiple for future earnings. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson Vibes is also gaining traction. As of Oct. 17, combined Meta AI daily active users for iOS and Android were up to 2.7 million, up from roughly 775,000 four weeks ago, according to market intelligence provider, Similarweb. Based on when Vibes was incorporated into the Meta AI app, the firm believes it was the catalyst for the app's recent growth. While Meta's Vibes could be its answer to Sora 2, Vibes is ""still technically behind Sora,"" Nathanson wrote in a note clients Oct. 13. Unlike Sora, which blends real and AI-generated footage and runs on OpenAI's proprietary models, Vibes still relies on third-party tools and produces fully synthetic content. Beginning this summer, Meta embarked on an aggressive hiring spree to recruit top AI talent to close the gap with OpenAI and other AI startups, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly has grown frustrat ed with the company's AI standing. While Meta is now laying off 600 people in its AI division , the big-name hires it brought in this year were unaffected by the cuts, CNBC reported this week. In addition to cutting big checks for talent, Meta is pouring tens of billions of dollars into data center projects to expand its AI computing footprint. To date, investors have largely backed Meta's hefty AI spending on the belief that it is already improving its ad-targeting prowess, giving Zuckerberg breathing room on other, long-term AI pursuits such as his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" Brian Pitz, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, argued that Meta's scale and adaptability give it a powerful cushion against any potential disruption from Sora 2. ""If one area of growth starts slowing, they can step on the gas in another,"" he said, pointing to apps like WhatsApp and Threads that aren't yet big moneymakers, though Meta did introduce ads on both platforms this year . Additionally, Meta's history of ""fast-growing"" innovations – from rolling out Stories to compete with Snapchat or Reels in response to TikTok – shows the company's capacity to catch up to competitors and ultimately win in engagement, Pitz said. Most importantly, Pitz said Meta's ""competitive moat"" remains its more than 3 billion daily active users – an audience OpenAI is still far from matching for both Sora 2 and its flagship product, ChatGPT, which has 800 million weekly active users . ""A little bit of new monetization goes a really long way on that big of a user base,"" said Pitz, who has a hold-equivalent rating and $710 price target on Meta stock. A more fundamental question looms over the rise of Sora 2 and even Meta's own Vibes: Do people really want fully AI-generated content on social media? While Sora's growth is eye-popping, Pitz thinks the hype could fade. ""It's hard to call it a winner here,"" he said of Sora, warning that users may get tired of synthetic feeds or abandon platforms over copyright disputes and AI ""slop"" content. ""You risk ending up with a pool of craziness,"" Pitz said. Some data suggests the Sora 2 buzz is already fizzling among the few million people who were invited to download it. It's hard to call it a winner here. BMO analyst Brian Pitz ""While a plausible [competitive] concern, our data checks point to retention softness at Sora,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note Tuesday. ""In fact, by day 7, we find that ~98% of initial users no longer open the app. As such, in our view, the app still lacks the scale and retention levels to be a meaningful new competitor to Instagram/ Facebook engagement."" For now, that's music to the ears of Meta investors. And soon, they'll get to hear directly from Zuckerberg on this question — and many more, like if there are additional signs its AI investments are paying off companywide — when the company reports its third-quarter results Oct. 29 and holds its post-earnings conference call with analysts.

AAPL,Previewing Mag 7 Earnings: What Investors Should Know,,"Image Source: Unsplash

We get into the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 800 companies reporting results, including five of the Magnificent 7 members and almost a third of S&P 500 members. We have Microsoft (MSFT - Free Report) , Meta Platform (META - Free Report) , and Alphabet (GOOGL - Free Report) on deck to report results on Wednesday, October 29th, and Apple (AAPL - Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN - Free Report) on Thursday, October 30th.

With Tesla’s results already out, only Nvidia remains to report Q3 results, which are scheduled for November 19th.

The Mag 7 stocks as a group have performed roughly in line with the market this year, though Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft have done much better, while Amazon and Apple have lagged, as the year-to-date performance chart below shows.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Except for Apple, the four Mag 7 members reporting this week are all leaders in the artificial intelligence space and are actively investing in setting up data centers and related infrastructure to run large language models.

A big marker in the AI debate around these companies has been the ever-rising level of capital expenditures, a race from which Apple has been missing in action, helping explain a big part of the stock’s recent underperformance.

Alphabet shares have enjoyed favorable momentum lately. A positive conclusion to the DOJ’s case has been the primary catalyst, but Alphabet’s last two quarterly reports were also very strong.

The market will be focused on the company’s cloud business, where improved capacity is expected to build on the acceleration seen in the last quarterly report. Management’s commentary around the cloud business was very positive in July, likely indicative of a very favorable demand backdrop and some market share gains. The technical challenges faced by Amazon’s AWS clients in recent days were after the Q3 reporting period, but will also likely come up on the earnings calls.

One perennial market worry about Alphabet is the outlook for the search business in the emerging AI world, with many in the market concerned that Alphabet may not be able to sustain its dominance of this lucrative space. Alphabet’s July results went some ways towards easing those worries, but a strong showing this time will consolidate those gains.

Looking at Q3 expectations for the group as a whole, the expectation is that Mag 7 earnings will increase +11.9% in 2025 Q3 from the same period last year on +15.3% higher revenues. These expectations are a blend of Tesla's actual results and estimates for the remaining six, of which five are on deck to report this week.

The chart below shows the group’s 2025 Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what was achieved in the preceding period and what is expected in the coming three quarters.

The group has been enjoying a steadily improving earnings outlook, with analysts raising their estimates. We saw that trend in play ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season, and something similar is in place for 2025 Q4 as well.

Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard

Including all reports released through Friday, October 24th, we now have Q3 results from 145 S&P 500 members, or 29% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +14.9% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues, with 86.9% beating EPS estimates and 82.1% beating revenue estimates.

The comparison charts below put the Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates from these companies in a historical context.

AAPL,"Stocks rally and Dow closes above 47,000 for first time after cooler-than-expected inflation report | CNN Business",,"Better-than-expected inflation data Friday morning sparked an end-of-week rally in stocks, sending the Dow, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soaring to fresh record highs.

The Dow gained 473 points, or 1.01%, and closed at 47,207.12. The blue-chip index closed above 47,000 for the first time ever.

The broader S&P 500 climbed 0.79%. The Nasdaq gained 1.15%. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, sank 5%.

Wall Street sentiment got a boost Friday after Consumer Price Index data for September showed annual inflation heated up in September but less than expected.

That boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming policy meetings next week and in December. Fed rate cuts can lower savings and borrowing rates, encouraging spending and investing and boosting business activity, creating a sustained tailwind for the stock market.

Meanwhile, corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street. Ford shares (F) rose 12% on Friday and had their best day since 2020 after the automaker posted strong third-quarter earnings results.

“When the Fed is lowering rates and earnings are good, markets don’t go down very much,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer at Crossmark Global Investments. “That’s where we find ourselves.”

“Earnings drive stocks, and earnings have been pretty good,” Doll said.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their best week since early August. The Dow posted its best week since early July.

“With the Fed cutting rates — and this report does nothing to stop them from a [quarter-point] cut next week — and corporate profits continuing to increase, it’s hard to see an interruption of this year’s bull market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",CNN,2025-10-24T20:07:54Z,https://us.cnn.com/2025/10/24/investing/us-stock-market,0.6,2025-10-25 13:49:51.442755,,0.192156862745098
AAPL,What Cramer expects from 10 stocks reporting earnings next week; calls two buys,,"Earnings season next week goes into overdrive as more than 150 companies in the S & P 500 report their quarterly results. Most of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech firms are among them. With Tesla already out and Nvidia not out until Nov. 19, that leaves Alphabet and Club names Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft . In total, 10 companies in the portfolio are on next week's list. Here is where Jim Cramer stands on each. Tuesday Corning reports its third-quarter earnings before Tuesday's open. The specialty glass maker is our newest stock in the portfolio. We started a small position a couple of weeks ago to give us some room to buy on a pullback. Jim expects the company's results are ""going to be blowout"" fueled by surging sales in its optical communication enterprise business tied to growing AI demand. ""If you don't have a position in Corning, you probably want to put some on before and after,"" Jim said. Wednesday Boeing delivers its third-quarter results before Wednesday's open. We're looking out for what the non-cash charge will be for the 777x program, the company's next-generation, long-haul jet. The aerospace giant will be raising its production of the 737 Max, making room for more deliveries and stronger free cash flow. The management team should be ""talking about a series of orders,"" coming in, Jim said, adding that ""if you don't have any Boeing, it's not too late to buy."" Starbucks reports its fiscal fourth quarter after Wednesday's closing bell. Jim believes this will be the ""last bad quarter"" for the coffee giant, which is still in the midst of a turnaround headed by CEO Brian Niccol, who did wonders when he led Chipotle . Jim interviewed Niccol last week and came away optimistic about the company's trajectory in 2026. Meta is out Wednesday evening with third-quarter earnings. The social media giant is ""getting a lot of advertising business, doing a lot of things very right,"" Jim said. The mega cap tech giant has been at the forefront of the most talked about theme this year – and likely next — which companies will be among the AI winners. Microsoft reports its fiscal 2026 first quarter, also after the close Wednesday. Jim sees upside to the numbers, citing the Windows refresh driven by personal computer shipments and its cloud business Azure, which is ""going quite well"" and likely taking share in the cloud computing market. Thursday Bristol Myers Squibb reports its third quarter before the opening bell Thursday. Jim thinks the biopharmaceutical company's results ""will disappoint."" We invested in the company for the promise of Cobenfy, a prescription used to treat schizophrenia. Unfortunately, a major drug trial for a new indication went poorly. Barring any positive Cobenfy news, our thesis must be reassessed. Bristol Myers shares have lost 22% year to date. Drugmaker Eli Lilly also reports before the open. Jim said, ""We're not going to see anything rally"" from the Mounjaro and Zepbound maker unless there's a positive update on the cost of GLP-1 drugs. ""That's unfortunate because I think that [Lily] is going very, very well,"" Jim said. Amazon , out with Q3 results after Thursday's close, is going to have to show revenue acceleration ""back to 2021"" levels in its cloud business, Jim noted. This would help Amazon Web Services shake off the narrative that its cloud growth has seen better days. Apple also reports Thursday evening. Jim feels confident in the iPhone maker's fiscal fourth quarter, given signals that the new iPhone models are selling better than many had expected. The stock surged to an all-time intraday high Monday after positive commentary from Wall Street analysts and upbeat iPhone demand data. Friday Linde reports its third-quarter before Friday's open. Jim is comfortable heading into the quarter after the industrial gas giant's recent upbeat fireside chats with analysts. Jim said he ""likes that situation,"" referring to the company as ""one of the most reliable stocks we own for the Club.""

AAPL,"Steve and Me (Fortune, 2011) | Fortune",,"Nevertheless, Steve was merely mortal. And his storied life was one of dissonances and contradictions. He proudly flouted authority, yet he embodied extreme self-discipline. He wouldn’t suffer fools, but that wouldn’t keep him from turning on the charm to woo a “bozo” who had something he needed. He was the ultimate nano-manager, who also could limn the grand strokes of a big picture that others rarely could fully perceive without his help.

While he never settled for anything but the extraordinary and dearly loved his Gulfstream jet, he led a curiously modest domestic life, especially after he had married and embraced fatherhood. He was intensely private, yet he hid in plain sight. He took his physical health far more seriously than most of us, yet his body utterly failed him. And the final irony is that when he died, by many measures he was at long last reaching his full stride. Yes, he had manipulated other people all along the way, sometimes callously. Likewise, we journalists exploited his fame and charisma whenever we could. But now that he’s gone, it’s plain to see that in the process of transforming all of our lives, Steve used himself up.

Looking back on my 25 years of dealings with Steve as an outsider who occasionally was invited in, there were chapters in his story I was never able to tell, either because they would violate a personal confidence or because what I had learned didn’t really fit into a typical analytical business story. They are the kinds of observations and experiences that, for me, gave Steve a three-dimensionality and a depth of humanity that myths inevitably foreshorten.

Indeed, over the years the Jobs legend all too often bordered on cliché. And in many ways he liked it that way. Consequently one of the challenges—and there were many in telling his story — was to come up with apt and original ways to describe his uncanny knack for fanning something akin to lust for just about anything he chose to tout, whether it be a computer mouse or a software upgrade or a Pixar movie. Early on, when Steve was still in his twenties, one of his engineers called him a walking, talking “reality distortion field,” and the metaphor (which he detested) stuck. Likewise, “brash” and “mercurial” became the overused adjectives of choice for many when describing his notoriously prickly personality.

In reality, his talents and idiosyncrasies were so diverse, complementary, and unusual that there were many different ways to interpret and describe his genius, and that was a big part of the fun. Ross Perot called him “the damnedest one-man band I’ve ever seen.” Business guru Jim Collins likened him to the “Beethoven of business.” Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison dubbed him “our Picasso.”

In various Fortune cover stories I called him the computer industry’s “chief esthetic officer” at Apple (AAPL) and the “original impresario of virtual reality” at Pixar. And during Apple’s sluggish stasis in the early 2000s, prior to hatching the iPod that would turbocharge its growth, I mockingly called him the “graying prince of a shrinking kingdom.” Truth be told, that elicited a quick phone call from the “brash and mercurial” Jobs to tell me how it had given him a good laugh. Seriously.

I first met Steve Jobs in February 1987, not long after moving to the San Francisco Bay Area to be the lead technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal. This was early in his “wilderness period,” after he had been booted out of Apple in 1985. Within months Jobs had recruited a band of Apple colleagues to start a new computer company, appropriately called Next. On a whim, in 1986 he also plunked down $10 million to buy the digital-animation skunkworks that would come to be called Pixar Animation Studios, from film director George Lucas. It was a steal of a deal and would eventually make Steve an honest-to-God billionaire a decade later, after he took it public in 1995. (When Disney (DIS) acquired Pixar in 2006 and he became Disney’s biggest shareholder and a director, his stake was worth many billions.)

Jobs cultivated our relationship because he wanted to stay in the public eye in order to promote Next and Pixar and to rebuild his credibility as a business and technology savant. He knew that I also covered Apple for the Journal, and let me know that if I ever wanted to exchange “intelligence” or needed a back channel to understand the real dynamics of what was becoming an ongoing soap opera in Cupertino, he was around.

I wrote several feature stories for the Journal about both Next and Pixar before moving on to Fortune in 1989. Jobs and I seemed to click personally, in part because we were virtually the same age and had experienced similar adolescent rites of passage, and we shared a strikingly similar taste in books and movies and music. We would find out a few years later that one of my best friends from high school had very nearly married Steve’s sister, the novelist Mona Simpson. Talk about a small world. (Steve, who was adopted as an infant, was in the process of tracking her down when I first met him.)

Still, I was always the reporter and Steve was the source and subject; I was the ink-stained wretch, and he was the rock star. More than anything, he wanted to get his stories told to the biggest and best audience possible, and I could give him that. For my part, I could sense he was bound for even bigger things and wanted to have a front-row seat. And so the overarching purpose for our social and personal interactions over the next 20 years would be journalistic transactions. And not all of them would please him.

The goal in most of my encounters with Steve was to bump him out of keynote mode and get him to extemporize about business, technology, the arts and media, politics and world events, and even his personal life. His instant analyses could be as sharp as they were blunt. That’s when you would begin to see the true depth of his insight and intelligence, and realize that his penchant for performing was also something of a smoke screen that obscured his incredibly quick mind. There was so much one could learn in an unscripted hour with Jobs that my top editors at Fortune in New York City timed trips so that they could tag along on my interviews with him.

In one instance, John Huey, who is now Time Inc.’s editor-in-chief, joined me at Apple headquarters in Cupertino in 2003, not for a story interview but instead to get Jobs’ advice on how he would clean up our struggling parent company, then known as AOL Time Warner. Steve looked at us incredulously and muttered something about what a waste of time it was to look in the rearview mirror. He then proceeded to spend the next 20 minutes methodically explaining in excruciating detail why AOL’s business model of being a dial-up Internet service was a complete mismatch and had served only to slow down Time Warner’s build-out of its much more promising broadband business. Then he waxed acerbic about why AOL’s “postcard production values” for its online content were so “hopelessly last-century.”

“Well, I guess that means you don’t think it could be fixed,” Huey said. To which Jobs replied, “I didn’t say that. I know how you could fix it. I’m just not interested.” Then, inexplicably, he went to the whiteboard and spent 15 more minutes mapping out a strategy right off the top of his head to turn AOL into something more like a media company. (That’s more or less the course AOL (AOL) eventually followed, albeit with mixed success, after being spun out of Time Warner (TWX) several years later.)

“That’s how I’d do it,” he concluded, snapping the cap back on the dry marker with a flourish. “But like I said, I’m not interested.”

The most enlightening meetings often were ones that Steve himself initiated, usually with a telephone call to my home out of the blue and always with a very specific purpose in mind. One Saturday morning in May 1995, he rang up and asked me to grab my two grade-school-age daughters and bring them over to his house in Palo Alto right away. “I’m watching Reed this morning, and I’ve got something cool to show them” was all he would say.

When we arrived, 3-year-old Reed Jobs greeted us at the kitchen door, wrapped in blue and red silk scarves and screeching, “I’m a witch!!!”

After making some popcorn and getting the kids some juice, Steve led us into the den and slapped a VHS cassette into the player. The music swelled and a stream of illegible, pencil-drawn storyboards simulating the opening credits of a movie flashed on the screen. And then, suddenly, an entirely new kind of animation burst forth in full color. All three kids were spellbound, even though the full animation had been completed for only half the movie. The soundtrack was finished, but entire scenes were only partially animated or in storyboard form.

It turned out that this was an early cut of Toy Story, the movie that would put Pixar on the map after its premiere six months later. The board of directors hadn’t even seen this much of it. But this was market research, Steve Jobs-style. When it was over, he asked my kids (not me), “Whaddya think? Is it as good as Pocahontas?” Greta and Fernanda nodded vigorously. “Well, then, is it as good as The Lion King?” Fernanda replied, “I won’t be able to make up my mind until I see Toy Story five or six more times.”

Meeting with Steve wasn’t always fun and games. On the Sunday after Christmas in 1995, Steve summoned me to his house to “talk on background” about the drama unfolding at Apple. This was around the time it had been rumored that either Sun Microsystems or Philips NV was about to make a bid to acquire the troubled company, and Steve was dropping hints that he and his “best friend” Ellison, the founder and CEO of Oracle (ORCL), were contemplating making their own bid for the company if that happened.

It seemed an odd gambit, and I told him it sounded to me like courting trouble. Steve replied that he wasn’t really that serious about it. Still, he swore me to secrecy and then walked me out to my car. When he saw the decaying 1976 Toyota Celica parked at the curb, he stopped short. “I sure hope you don’t drive your kids around in that thing! I’m not joking. That car has no airbags. Get rid of it.”

A year later, in late 1996, rather than team up with Ellison to make a run at Apple, Jobs persuaded Apple CEO Gil Amelio to acquire Next for $400 million and take him on as a special adviser. Once inside, it wasn’t long — seven months to be exact — before he had engineered a palace coup and put his team from Next in charge. Jobs’ wilderness years had ended, and the sequel to the Steve Jobs Myth was about to begin.

During the next seven years I wrote four cover stories about Steve’s transformative leadership at Apple and edited another. He gave Fortune an exclusive first look at the Mac OS X operating system. He also allowed me to be the only journalist to observe how frighteningly temperamental he could be during the final rehearsal for one of his Macworld keynote speeches. In 2001 he showed me the first iPod (under embargo) several weeks before it was publicly announced, primarily so he could see what I thought of his remarks for the introduction. And a year later he gave Fortune a first look at the iTunes Music Store before it went live online.

Of course, he took serious issue with some of the stories we published about him, and when he did, I’d be the first to hear about it. When we used him as the cover image for a June 2001 story called “Inside the Great CEO Pay Heist,” he threatened to pull Apple ads from Fortune indefinitely. Although I didn’t write that story, I encouraged him to write a letter to the editor to make the case that the story unfairly maligned him. He had a point, but in the end, he didn’t ever hold a grudge. Not against me, at least.

I feel more strongly about Steve Jobs than any other famous person I have written about for one other reason. Like him, I have spent a lot of time in the hospital. Fifteen years ago I had my first heart attack, and when Steve heard about it, he called my hospital room to chew me out for being a smoker for much of my life. Six years ago I nearly died after a freak infection in an artificial heart valve turned into meningitis in my spine and brain, which in turn wiped out most of my hearing. I was in the hospital for five weeks, and Steve came to visit me twice, even though I was bordering on delusional at the time. I couldn’t hear him either, so he had to write down what he wanted to say to me, which included a joke about Bill Gates that shouldn’t be repeated.

When I recovered, I started planning a book project I wanted to call Founders Keepers that would attempt to explain why certain entrepreneurs seem to be able to grow as business leaders even faster than the companies they create. Steve consented to be one of the primary subjects of the book, along with Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Andy Grove. All of them had agreed to meet with me for a roundtable discussion in Silicon Valley in late November 2008.

For more on Steve Jobs, watch this Fortune video:

One week before the meeting, Steve called me at home. “I really hate to do this, Brent, but I have to back out of our meeting.” Maybe it was just my new hearing aid, but he sounded uncharacteristically subdued. “I trust you not to say anything to anyone about why I’m canceling on you, but I’ll tell you the truth. I really have to get to the bottom of my health problems once and for all. I’m in no condition to meet with anyone and am going to go on an extended medical leave after Thanksgiving.” Three weeks later he received a liver transplant. We spoke only a few times after that. And three years later he was gone.

Steve Jobs certainly was a living legend and a prima donna, as well as a journalist’s dream interview. He could be a beguiling charmer when he wanted to be and a petulant whiner when things didn’t go his way. He loved his family. Yes, he was larger than life, but life deserted him. In other words, he was as human as they come.

AAPL,IPO-rumored company beats every Wall Street giant with 99% profit margin,,"“We have a 99% profit margin. There is no other company in the world that has that,"" said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of stablecoin issuing company Tether. The bold claim comes along with an even more ambitious forecast: Tether expects to generate $15 billion in profits by year-end.
To put that in perspective, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) net profit fell by 37% year-over-year in its recent quarterly reports, while Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) net profit rose about 9% year-over-year in its last quarter. By comparison, Tether’s staggering margin would eclipse nearly every major Wall Street firm.
But do predictions tell the whole story?
Not exactly. To start with, Tether operates in a regulatory gray zone. The company issues USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. But since it is headquartered in El Salvador, it is not bound by U.S. auditing or disclosure requirements, unlike Tesla or Apple.
However, the company does release “attestations,"" or periodic snapshots prepared by a third-party accounting firm that confirm the assets and liabilities at a specific moment in time.
Critics say these attestations fall short of full, independent audits, leaving questions about the company’s true financial health.
In fact, in 2021, the company was even fined by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for misrepresenting its stablecoin reserves.
Ardoino's bold prediction amid IPO buzz
On Oct. 24, Ardoino sat down with Bloomberg during the Plan B Forum in Lugano, Switzerland, where he predicted that the company's profits would reach $15 billion.
“This year we’re going to approach another $15 billion profit. That’s very rare,” Ardoino said.
Recommended Articles
Tether's reported profit in the previous year was $13 billion.
The prediction follows reports of a potential $20 billion fundraising round in exchange for a roughly 3% stake in the company. Such a deal would value Tether at around $500 billion.
Meanwhile, USDT’s supply has also surged to $182 billion, cementing Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin market.
The rumored fundraising round has fueled speculation that Tether could be preparing for an eventual initial public offering. However, Ardoino has consistently denied any plans for a public listing, a path Tether's peer stablecoin issuer Circle took, which went public in June.
When asked about potential investors, Ardoino declined to name any specific parties.
“There are many funds and tech funds that have in their portfolio many companies that could use part of our technology and other offerings that we have. It’s about synergy and creating bigger impact,"" he told Bloomberg.
“We have a 99% profit margin,” he added. “There is no other company in the world that has that.”

US indices closed the final trading session of the week in the green and were buoyed by a soft US CPI report, which did little to alter money market pricing into the Fed next week, whereby a 25-bps cut is a near certainty. Sectors were predominantly firmer, with Technology and Communications outperforming, while Energy lagged ahead of a deluge of earnings next week, with 5 out of the Mag-7 reporting. The Dollar was eventually flat, but saw weakness after the aforementioned CPI report, while the Pound was boosted following a much stronger than expected set of UK retail sales, and the CAD was initially hit after Trump ended all trade talks with Canada after they put out anti-tariff adverts, albeit Canada is set to pull the ad. The crude complex was choppy, but ended the week with sizeable gains as US/Russia relations worsened, with focus on US-China talks next week. T-Notes settled little changed despite surging higher following the softer inflation metrics. Elsewhere on the data footing, US S&P Global PMIs impressed with both Mfg. and Services printing above consensus, but UoM missed expectations with a fall in current conditions and expectations, with the 1-year inflation expectation unchanged at 4.6%, but the 5-year rising to 3.9% from 3.7%. Next week, the PCE and GDP data will likely be cancelled, but focus will be on 2, 5 and 7-year supply as well as US/China trade talks, and of course, the Fed meeting.

US

CPI: Headline CPI rose 0.3% M/M in September, cooler than the 0.4% expected and prior, with the Y/Y rising 3.0%, up from the prior 2.9% but below the 3.1% forecast. Core measures rose 0.2% (exp. 0.3%, prev 0.3%), with the Y/Y with the Y/Y rising 3.0%, beneath the 3.1% forecast and prior. The report will be welcome but likely changes little for the Fed, with inflation still above target at 3.0%. However, given that there was no acceleration M/M, it shows inflationary pressures remain contained. Expectations at the Fed are building that tariffs will not result in persistent inflation, but price pressures are expected to remain into 2026, before cooling in H2 '26 and returning to target in 2027 - providing the situation stays similar to the current picture. ING summarises the data as giving the green light to rate cuts. The desk notes that softer than expected, with tariff effects remaining limited. Says that should gradually change, but gives more time for disinflationary forces such as energy, housing and softer wages to mitigate the tariff impact. ""In any case, the Fed's more pressing concern is the cooling jobs market as it looks to optimise policy for its dual mandate"".

FLASH PMI: The S&P Global Flash PMI data in the US was better than expected. The Composite rose to 54.8 from 53.9, with the manufacturing component rising to 52.2 from 52, and services lifting to 55.2 from 54.2. Within the report, it noted that the data is consistent with the economy growing at a 2.5% annualised rate in October after a similar rise was signalled for Q3. It highlighted that business activity growth in October was the second-fastest so far this year, and was accompanied by the largest rise in new business seen in 2025 to date. ""Improvements in output and new work were recorded in manufacturing and services, though both sectors signalled falling exports. Factories also reported falling input buying amid a steep drop in backlogs of work and an unprecedented build-up of unsold stock."" On employment, growth picked up, but the pace was modest, and it weakened in manufacturing. Prices charged for goods and services rose at the slowest rate since April, but firms' costs continued to increase sharply due to the impact of tariffs alongside upward wage pressures.

FIXED INCOME

T-NOTE FUTURES (Z5) SETTLE 1+ TICK LOWER AT 113-14

T-Notes settle little changed despite soft CPI. At settlement, 2-year 0.0bps at 3.482%, 3-year +0.3bps at 3.487%, 5-year +0.5bps at 3.602%, 7-year +0.7bps at 3.784%, 10-year +1.0bps at 3.999%, 20-year +1.6bps at 4.558%, 30-year +1.6bps at 4.587%.

INFLATION BREAKEVENS: 1-year BEI -10.6bps at 3.118%, 3-year BEI -3.4bps at 2.590%, 5-year BEI -2.5bps at 2.334%, 10-year BEI -1.0bps at 2.277%, 30-year BEI -0.3bps at 2.223%.

THE DAY: T-Notes had rallied in response to the softer than expected CPI data, but the moves then started to pare with T-Notes meandering into settlement to settle little changed. The report helps keep rate cuts on the table as although inflation remains above target, it is not accelerating away, and the Fed can take out another risk management cut next week. A lot of the focus has been shifting towards the labour side of the mandate, although the Fed is relying on private data at the moment, given the government shutdown. Shortly after the CPI report, the flash S&P Global PMI data was released, which weighed on T-Notes following a better-than-expected report. It also noted ""The survey data are consistent with the economy expanding at a 2.5% annualised rate in October after a similar rise was signalled for the third quarter."" Meanwhile, the UoM data missed expectations with a fall in current conditions and expectations, with the 1-year inflation expectation unchanged at 4.6%, but the 5-year rising to 3.9% from 3.7%. Next week, the PCE and GDP data will likely be cancelled, but focus will be on 2, 5 and 7-year supply as well as US/China trade talks, and of course, the Fed meeting.

The crude complex was choppy, but ended the week with sizeable gains as US/Russia relations worsened. Earlier in the session, benchmarks came under pressure as Axios reported that White House envoy Witkoff is to meet Russian counterpart this weekend, which comes despite the Putin/Trump meeting “on hold” and the US slapping more sanctions on Russia. Away from this, energy-specific newsflow was fairly sparse with cooler-than-expected US CPI the highlight, albeit little move was seen in energy. Elsewhere, in the weekly Baker Hughes rig count, oil rose 2 to 420, nat gas was unchanged at 121, leaving the total rising 2 to 550. WTI traded between USD 61.21-62.56/bbl and Brent USD 65.41-66.78/bbl, against the weekly range of USD 55.96-62.59/bbl and USD 60.07-66.78/bbl.

US FX WRAP

The Dollar was flat on Friday, despite seeing immediate weakness in the wake of the cooler-than-expected US CPI report. There was little move in money market pricing with a 25bps reduction priced in with almost 100% certainty at the FOMC next Wednesday. Elsewhere on the data footing, US S&P Global was strong, with Mfg. rising to 52.2 (prev. & exp. 52), and Services to 55.2 (exp. 53.5, prev. 54.2), and above the top end of the forecast range. Lastly, the final UoM for October saw sentiment revised lower to 53.6 from 55.0, with both conditions and expectations revised down to 58.6 (prev. 61.0) and 50.3 (prev. 51.2), respectively. 1yr inflation expectations was unchanged at 4.6%, with the longer-term 5yr revised higher to 3.9% from 3.7%.

G10 FX was pretty contained, although the EUR was the relative outperformer, albeit only seeing marginal gains, as the single-currency saw strength after better-than-anticipated German HCOB PMIs, but no extended move was seen on strong EU-wide figures. EUR/USD traded between 1.1601-47.

CAD ended the day flat but was the talk of the town on Friday as the Loonie was pressured overnight after US President Trump ended trade talks with Canada, in the wake of Ontario Premier Ford putting out anti-tariff adverts. In more recent trade, the Ontario government reportedly will take down anti-tariff ads after Trump ended trade talks, according to the Globe and Mail, citing sources. USD/CAD printed a high of 1.4039 against a low of 1.3975 and trades around 1.40 at the time of writing.

JPY was the relative G10 laggard, albeit on limited newsflow, as USD/JPY reached a high of 153.06. On the data footing, Japanese CPI and ex-food was in line, but ex-food & energy was slightly cooler than expected. The Pound was boosted early doors by a much stronger than expected set of UK retail sales, spurring an initial intra-day 1.3321 peak. However, this then pared modestly into the morning's PMIs, which were broadly better than anticipated, though no further move was spurred. Cable then hit a later high of 1.3359, given the Greenback move after US CPI.",Zero Hedge,2025-10-24T20:11:54Z,https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/stocks-rally-soft-cpi-ahead-fed-next-week-newsquawk-us-market-wrap,0.4,2025-10-25 13:49:51.441074,,0.2313725490196079
AAPL,This Could Be Great News for Apple Shareholders,,"Key Points

Research shows that Apple's recently released iPhone 17 products are off to a good start in terms of sales.

The iPhone is Apple's flagship product and makes up the majority of the company's sales.

Investors are still questioning whether the company has a real artificial intelligence strategy.

10 stocks we like better than Apple ›

It hasn't been the easiest year for the consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The company was heavily impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs, and CEO Tim Cook had to help the company navigate the political landscape carefully. Furthermore, many analysts and investors have called the company out for its lack of strategic direction when it comes to artificial intelligence, especially when compared to peers in the ""Magnificent Seven.""

But recently, the stock rallied after investors got great news.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

iPhone 17 sales are reportedly outperforming

In mid-September, Apple released the iPhone 17, the latest model of its flagship product. The iPhone 17 boasts a new ""Center Stage front camera"" that features higher resolution and better selfie picture capabilities. The model also features all-day battery life and the ability to charge up to 50% battery life in 20 minutes. Intelligent monitoring can also anticipate when the battery might run low and conserve power at the right time.

Following the launch, Wall Street analysts seemed split on the new iPhone, with some impressed and others questioning how meaningful the upgrades were. So far, though, iPhone 17 sales seem to be off to a good start. According to the research firm Counterpoint, the iPhone 17 has sold 14% more phones than the iPhone 16 models in the first 10 days of availability in the U.S. and China.

Analysts are now increasingly bullish that Apple will report strong sales numbers when the company reports earnings on Oct. 29. Following the news about sales, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah upgraded Apple stock from a hold to a buy and significantly raised his price target from $226 per share to $315. ""While [the] Street is baking in some degree of outperformance from AAPL's iPhone 17 family of products, we believe there remains material upside to Street expectations through CY2027,"" Baruah wrote in a research note.

iPhone sales can make up over half of Apple's total revenue, so any good news on this front is bound to raise the stock price.

Is the good news enough to boost Apple?

Solid iPhone sales are definitely great news for shareholders, since it's the company's flagship product. I think part of the success can be attributed to the fact that the iPhone 17 was priced at the same level as the iPhone 16 but featured noticeable product improvements, including more storage, a better camera, and faster charging capabilities. These are all core product features, so the company's ability to deliver a competitive price despite all of the tariff drama is worthy of recognition.

Is it enough to really say Apple has turned the corner from its struggles and is an easy buy at these levels? I am not so sure just yet. Remember, the stock has still underperformed the Magnificent Seven this year (as of Oct. 21). The stock also trades above its five-year average valuation at close to 33 times forward earnings.

Investors are still questioning whether Apple has a good strategy to reap the benefits of the AI revolution. While AI bears are questioning the level of AI capital expenditure spending across the broader industry right now, the market has largely rewarded companies that boost AI capex spending, believing it shows that they are racing to win the AI war. Apple's levels of AI capex still lag behind others in the Magnificent Seven. The patience may end up looking like a genius move down the road if the AI trade falters, but investors are still largely pedal to the metal on AI right now.

In fact, many investors are pushing for Apple to make a splash and buy the AI chatbot Perplexity, and Apple's CEO Tim Cook said he is open to AI acquisitions. Long-term investors certainly don't have to sell Apple, but it's not a glaring buy right now, despite the recent good news. Perhaps the upcoming quarterly results will change that.

What Altman Says Comes Next: Altman’s warning wasn’t just about fake videos. It was about what happens when so many of us outsource our decisions to algorithms few people understand.

“I do still think there are going to be some really strange or scary moments,” he said, stressing that just because AI hasn’t yet caused a catastrophic event “doesn’t mean it never will.” ""Billions of people talking to the same brain"" could create ""weird, societal-scale things,"" he said. Put another way, it could lead to unexpected chain reactions, causing consequential shifts in information, politics, and communal trust that ripple faster than anyone can control. Despite these broad shifts affecting us all, Altman argued against regulations for this technology. “Most regulation probably has a lot of downside,” he said. Though Altman also said he supports ""very careful safety testing"" for what he called “extremely superhuman” models. ""I think we'll develop some guardrails around it as a society,"" he said.

— MYTH MIND WORM IN THE VALLEY — 🧠 Silicon Valley’s Mind Worm: Agentic AI and Compute Fetishism — by Trader Guy/AI

The dominant obsession in Silicon Valley right now is agentic AI—systems that don’t just assist but act autonomously, making decisions, initiating actions, and even negotiating on behalf of users or companies. This is more than just smarter chatbots; it’s about building synthetic agents that can handle workflows, manage relationships, and even simulate emotional resonance.

But beneath that ambition lies a deeper worm: compute supremacy. The race for access to massive compute power has turned into a geopolitical and corporate arms race. OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute access, despite being backed by Microsoft. Meta inked a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud. Microsoft is now offering Anthropic’s models to its customers. These tangled alliances reveal a mind worm that’s not just about building smarter AI—it’s about controlling the infrastructure that makes it possible.

PROSE AND THE NUMBAHS

The day was S3H and well the clock showed you the way!

Spill up sealed at 9:50 am. The AM LOW was center time at 10:20 am. This sets up a strong MID AM at 11:30 center time. The lunch low is just under that at 12:30 pm. This is indicating a strong finish as the low us just a tad lower. Mid pm is center time at 2:30 pm. With the LAST HOUR LOW pulling back slightly to close just off the highs.

Trader Guy had a good take:

🧠 What’s Driving the Tape?

• Earnings optimism: Companies are beating expectations, and forward guidance remains strong.

• Fed policy shift: The December pivot toward rate cuts has lifted sentiment, but also introduced volatility.

• Equity overweight: Institutional investors are heavily allocated to equities—levels not seen since pre-2008. That’s bullish, but also a warning signal if sentiment turns.

🔍 Volume at the Highs: What the Tape Is Whispering

According to Kingsview’s capital-weighted volume and capital flows breached their own resistance levels before price did, which is rare and powerful. That means the volume isn’t just confirming the move—it’s leading it.

• Friday’s session showed a 95% inflow day, a decisive show of strength.

• Weekly flows were nearly 2-to-1 in favor of inflows, suggesting institutional conviction.

• Supply lines supported the advance, meaning volume wasn’t just passive—it was actively pushing through prior resistance.

This setup implies that smart money is already positioned, and retail may be late to the party. The breakout isn’t just technical—it’s being choreographed by capital flows that have already marked their scroll.

– Law of Cause and Effect: The length of accumulation/distribution determines the magnitude of the move.

– Law of Effort vs. Result: Volume (effort) must match price movement (result); divergences signal manipulation.

🧠 The Composite Man personifying the market as a single, strategic entity—the Composite Man—who:

– Accumulates stock quietly while the public is pessimistic.

– Pushes prices up to attract attention and volume.

– Distributes holdings at higher levels while the public buys in.

– Then lets the price fall, starting the cycle again.

📈 Accumulation Phases (Composite Man Buying)

| Phase | Description | Composite Man’s Intent

| A | (PS), (SC), (AR), (ST) | Absorbing supply, testing depth of selling pressure

| B | Building a Cause | Accumulating quietly, creating a trading range, shaking out weak hands

| C | Spring or Shakeout | Final test of support, false breakdown to trap bears and force capitulation

| D | Markup Begins | Breakout above resistance, demand dominates, public begins to enter

| E | Distribution Preparation | Price moves rapidly, Composite Man begins to sell into strength",Mr TopStep,2025-10-24T16:17:03Z,https://mrtopstep.com/🦅-am-turn-1024-up-up-and-away/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:49:54.833578,,-0.1686274509803921
AAPL,"Trump Vs. Netflix, Apple: White House Warns Warner Bros. Should 'Think Really Hard' About Bidders - Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD)",,"Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is listening to bids for its business and assets after receiving multiple offers from Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY).

If the President Donald Trump administration has its way, Warner Bros. will say yes to Paramount Skydance.

Trump Admin Signals Support for Paramount Skydance

Recent reports link multiple interested parties to acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery’s film and TV assets or the entire company.

Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Paramount Skydance, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have all been named as interested parties according to Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav.

The Trump administration could be tipping its hat to showing a preference for Paramount Skydance in any potential bidding war.

""Who owns Warner Bros. Discovery is every important to the administration,"" a senior Trump administration official told the New York Post. ""The Warner board needs to think very seriously not just on the price competition but which player in the suitor pool has been successful getting a deal done.""

While most investors can read between the lines and realize that this would likely mean Paramount Skydance, given their recent merger approved by the Trump administration, the senior official actually spells it out.

""And that points to the Ellisons,"" the senior administration official said.

The Ellisons refers to Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a longtime ally of Trump and one of the top owners of the media company.

""Warner really needs to think really hard about the odds of success getting the deal cleared with players outside of Paramount Skydance.""

The comments from the Trump administration suggest that Netflix, Amazon, Apple, or Comcast could face regulatory hurdles if they choose to pursue acquiring parts or all of Warner Bros. Discovery.

Comcast could face significant hurdles with the Trump administration due to its ownership of MSNBC and NBC, which have often been criticized by the president for being anti-Trump, according to the report.

Amazon and Netflix could face antitrust concerns if they try to buy streaming platform HBO Max or acquire the company outright.

Paramount previously paid a $16 million settlement to President Trump over a lawsuit against the company's ""60 Minutes"" program. The company's CBS division has since emphasized ending what it calls left-wing bias.

Warner Bros. & Paramount Skydance Tie-Up Coming?

Paramount Skydance has submitted multiple offers for Warner Bros. Discovery, including a bid of $24, which was rejected as being too low. Warner Bros. Discovery said it would explore offers after receiving bids from Paramount Skydance.

Warner Bros. Discovery has a planned split that will create two companies, one for the film and TV studios and one with cable channels. The planned split could make the sale of certain assets easier than from a company with no plans to split up segments.

Earlier this week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) criticized a potential combination of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance, given David Ellison's close ties to the president.

""One of Trump's billionaire buddies just bought Paramount. Now, he wants to buy Warner Bros,"" Warren tweeted.

Warren warned that a potential merger could have ""one giant company control almost everything you watch on TV.""

The Senator previously criticized the merger of Paramount and Skydance that was approved after the settlement with Trump. Warren said there should be an investigation after a ""big fat bribe"" was paid.

Warner Bros. Discovery Stock Action

Warner Bros. Discovery shares closed Friday down 0.5% at $21.15. Shares hit new 52-week highs of $21.57 during Friday's trading session. The stock is up over 98% year-to-date in 2025.

AAPL,Meta's Clash With EU Deepens After New EU Accusations Over Digital Rules - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META),,"Meta Platforms Inc‘s (NASDAQ:META) regulatory battle with the European Union escalated on multiple fronts in 2025.

The growing friction between Meta and the EU was on full display Friday, with regulators hitting the company with new allegations of violating digital content rules.

On Friday, the European Commission formally accused both Meta and ByteDance’s TikTok of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA).

The Commission issued preliminary findings that the platforms are illegally restricting researchers’ access to public data.

The regulatory body also singled out Meta, alleging that Facebook and Instagram make it too difficult for users to report illegal content and appeal moderation decisions.

In its initial findings, the Commission states that both TikTok and Meta have created cumbersome processes that hinder researchers’ access to public platform data.

The Commission leveled additional charges specifically against Meta. Regulators found that both Facebook and Instagram fail to provide a simple and accessible system for users to report illegal content.

These findings are preliminary, and the Commission has given Meta and TikTok the opportunity to respond and propose remedies. However, if the Commission ultimately confirms these violations, it can impose fines of up to 6% of the companies’ global annual turnover.

A new EU rule set to take effect on Oct. 29 will grant researchers even broader access to platform data.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta are reportedly in the final stages of negotiations with the European Commission to settle their respective antitrust cases.

The two tech giants are working to amend their business practices to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). This move comes after the EU fined them a combined 700 million euros in April for violating the new law.

In July, Meta banned all political, electoral, and social issue advertising on its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, within the EU. The company will implement the ban this October.

Meta attributes this decision to the “unworkable requirements” of the EU’s new Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising (TTPA) regulations. These rules were designed to increase transparency in online advertising following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Meta already faces a 200 million euros fine for data privacy violations, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously criticized the EU’s regulations as a form of “censorship.”

Meta is not the first company to take such a step. Last year, Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google announced a similar plan to block political advertising in the EU, citing the same regulatory challenges.

META Price Action: Meta Platforms shares were up 0.29% at $736.14 at the time of publication on Friday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

JPM,JPMorgan plots expansion into banking for Canadian tech firms,,"U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM-N is making a play to expand banking services to Canadian technology companies, two years after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank reordered the domestic sector.

JPMorgan, the world’s most valuable bank by market capitalization, is recruiting for a managing director for Canada for its “innovation economy” unit after making modest inroads in this country in recent years catering to the banking needs of innovation-driven companies.

JPM has five dedicated technology bankers in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and has picked up hundreds of clients in Canada, including legal software vendor Clio. The Vancouver-area company uses JP Morgan for cash management services and has a credit facility with the U.S. lender and fellow U.S. bank, Comerica Inc.

Inside some of the coolest Technology Fast 50 companies

According to its job posting, JPM is looking for a Canadian-based leader to hire and oversee a team “responsible for supporting the unique needs” of venture capital firms, founders and high-growth, venture capital-backed companies across eight technology subsectors, including enterprise software, climate technology and life sciences.

Three sources said JPM’s in-house recruiters have blanketed Canadian innovation banking executives with calls in recent weeks to gauge their interest in leading its local practice – and hitting them up for market intelligence on others in the sector.

Andrew Kresse, co-head of JPM’s innovation economy unit, said that after taking the role six months ago, “I saw the innovation economy business in Canada and said ‘We’re doing really well in Canada,’” adding that this country is one of the top 10 innovation markets globally.

“Now that we have critical mass, we want to have a senior leader in Canada who’s responsible for continuing to build the business and serve more clients,” he said. New York-based Mr. Kresse leads the group with John China, a former president with Silicon Valley Bank, who is in the San Francisco area.

JPM has operated in Canada for more than 100 years. Its Morgan Bank of Canada was the first foreign bank established here in 1981 and Chase Manhattan Canada received a charter as a Canadian bank a year later. JPM has 600 employees in Canada in five business lines, including investment banking, commercial banking, payments and asset management.

JPM is entering a crowded space: Canada’s big banks began catering in a more focused way to the particular demands of technology clients in the late 2010s as the sector’s post-credit-crisis renaissance took flight.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM-T bought technology financier Wellington Financial in 2018 and made it the cornerstone of its innovation banking group. Bank of Montreal BMO-T and Bank of Nova Scotia BNS-T followed by launching technology and innovation banking groups in 2019, the same year National Bank of Canada NA-T started expanding its long-established practice nationally. Then in 2020, Royal Bank of Canada RY-T hired former OMERS Ventures managing partner Sid Paquette to consolidate and expand its technology-focused banking practice under the brand RBCx, establishing Canada’s largest bank as the biggest domestic player in the sector.

The Canadian banks benefited after U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, an early specialty technology financier, collapsed two years ago. Several raided SVB’s Canadian ranks, including Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T, which became the last of the Big Five to enter the tech banking space in 2023, while National Bank bought SVB’s Canadian loan portfolio.

Mr. Kresse said the goal of JPM is to “complement the local banks” by pitching itself as the bank of choice for Canadian tech companies as they expand globally, particularly those requiring more lucrative services including advising on mergers and acquisitions, raising large growth and private equity financings or going public. JPM already commands a reputation as one of the world’s top investment banks. It is likely to factor as a leading contender to lead initial public offerings of sizable Canadian private technology companies that choose to list primarily in the United States if the market for new issues continues to warm up.

JPMorgan’s innovation economy unit started in 2016. It has more than 11,000 clients in 40 markets, with 550 employees in 25 countries. The strategy in Canada is to offer a full range of banking services, including deposit-taking (which it can do as a Schedule II bank in Canada, meaning it is a Canadian subsidiary of a foreign bank), cash management, asset management, credit lines and private banking, plus more specialized offerings catering to the sector including offering venture debt. Industry observers expect JPM to focus on the larger, more advanced Canadian companies, but Mr. Kresse said that isn’t necessarily the case.

“For us it’s about simple banking and advising,” said Mr. Kresse. Prospective customers “need advice on how to scale their business. You’ll want to partner with a firm who is used to working with the top 1,000 investors in the world. You may come to JPMorgan if you are thinking of expanding globally.”

He said the goal is to fill the role by early next year with “someone who has been in the ecosystem and knows both the investors as well as the companies. It’s important for us to have a leader who is local in this space.”

He said the plan is to double JPM’s business and employee count, adding: “We’ll grow as needed to support our clients and prospective clients. If we see more demand we’ll continue to grow.”",The Globe and Mail,2025-10-24T20:49:08Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-jpmorgan-technology-banking-innovation-economy-managing-director/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:49:58.764928,,0.4431372549019608
JPM,Advanced Energy Industries and Paycom Software have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – October 24, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Advanced Energy Industries AEIS as the Bull of the Day and Paycom Software PAYC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Rigetti Computing, Inc.'s RGTI, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

To say there's a lot of hype around AI is the understatement of the decade. It's been at the headlines of this rally, helping create new fortunes and fuel the next generation of bellwethers. These names have already made some epic runs. If only there was a way to play the surge in a more sustainable way. Maybe...a company that helps to power all these chips and such. Today's Bull of the Day is one of those names.

Enter Advanced Energy Industries, the unsung hero of the silicon supply chain, sitting squarely at the intersection of physics, precision, and profitability. It's not a chipmaker. It's not an equipment behemoth like Applied Materials. AEIS is the one building the finely tuned, high-precision power systems that make every wafer fab hum like a Swiss watch. When it comes to semiconductor manufacturing, AEIS is the quiet voice that says, ""You want clean power? You want consistency down to the electron? We got you.""

Let's get into why this stock, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the most intriguing mid-cap semiconductor plays on the board right now.

The Power Behind the Process

Every chip, whether it's in your iPhone, your Tesla, or your AI data center, starts life in a fabrication plant that's part physics lab, part cleanroom cathedral. These fabs depend on incredibly stable and precise power delivery systems to etch, deposit, and measure at the atomic level.

That's AEIS's playground.

The company designs and manufactures high-performance power conversion, measurement, and control solutions for advanced semiconductor and industrial applications. Think plasma power for etching and deposition, high-voltage power for inspection, and thermal control for all the processes in between. If you've ever wondered how a fab keeps the electricity steady enough to carve a transistor only a few atoms thick, AEIS is the answer.

That's why Applied Materials, Lam Research and Tokyo Electron are among its biggest customers. They build the gear. AEIS gives that gear its pulse.

Tailwinds Stronger Than a Cleanroom Airflow

If you're wondering why AEIS is in such a sweet spot, it's because everything semiconductors touch is expanding.

AI data centers? They need more wafers. EVs? More power electronics. Renewable energy? More advanced inverters and control systems. And the global fab buildout, led by the U.S., South Korea, and Taiwan, is a multi-year infrastructure boom that plays right into AEIS's hands.

Semiconductor capital equipment spending in 2025 is projected to rebound by double digits after a soft 2024, and AEIS's management has already signaled that demand from leading-edge nodes (sub-5 nanometer processes) is beginning to recover. The company's broad exposure means it benefits not only from memory and logic production but also from advanced packaging and inspection. These are areas less cyclical than pure front-end chipmaking.

Earnings Energy

Now, the beauty of AEIS isn't just in the technology, it's in the trajectory.

The company's last few quarters have shown the kind of disciplined execution you love to see in a cyclical sector. Margins are expanding, backlog visibility is improving, and analysts have been steadily revising earnings to the upside.

There is a lot cooking under the hood with this company. Current year Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for $5.68 with is good for 53% growth year-over-year. That's slated to grow another 15% to $6.54 next year.

Onto the revenue side of the equation, current year forecasts call for 16.7% growth to $1.73 billion with next year adding another 6.76% to $1.85 billion.

According to its last earnings report, gross margins are hovering near 38%, with management targeting the low 40s by 2026 through better product mix and cost discipline.

AEIS doesn't chase wild, unprofitable growth. It engineers steady, sustainable profitability.

Bear of the Day:

It's never fun when a market darling falls out of favor, especially one that used to print money faster than the Fed during COVID. But that's exactly what's happening with today's Bear of the Day, Paycom Software. This once high-flying HR tech stock has been grounded by slowing growth, margin pressure, and increased competition in the payroll software space. If this were an episode of Shark Tank, Kevin O'Leary would be telling them to ""take it behind the barn and shoot it.""

Paycom has long been a favorite among investors who loved its high-margin, recurring-revenue model and sticky customer base. The company provides human capital management (HCM) solutions all in one integrated cloud platform. For years, it rode the SaaS wave higher, turning HR drudgery into a scalable subscription machine.

But lately, that machine's been sputtering. Revenue growth, once clipping along above 25%, has decelerated sharply. Last quarter, Paycom reported just low-teens top-line growth, missing Wall Street's expectations. Analysts have since trimmed their forward estimates and those estimate cuts are precisely what push stocks into Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) territory.

A big part of what makes the Zacks Rank system powerful is that it tracks analyst estimate revisions. Unfortunately, the revisions here are unmistakably bearish. Over the last 60 days, several analysts have slashed their EPS forecasts for both this year and next. The current consensus for fiscal 2025 earnings now sits well below where it was just two months ago.

Margins, once north of 40%, have come under pressure as the company spends heavily to retain clients and fend off growing competition from the likes of Paylocity, ADP, and Workday. Meanwhile, a sluggish hiring environment means fewer paychecks to process, which means fewer dollars flowing through Paycom's system.

Here's the irony: Paycom's biggest threat might be itself. The company rolled out ""Betty,"" its automated payroll platform, designed to revolutionize how HR departments run payroll by eliminating manual input. The problem? Many of Paycom's existing customers are transitioning to Betty, which actually reduces their usage fees. The innovation cannibalized the cash cow.

When your best new product makes your old one obsolete, Wall Street doesn't cheer, it runs for cover. Analysts have been quick to notice that Betty's rollout, while strategically sound for the long term, is crushing near-term growth.

Once upon a time, investors were happy to pay sky-high multiples for hypergrowth names like PAYC. Now, that multiple compression is brutal. The stock's forward P/E has fallen from the 70s down to the low 20s, and that's assuming the estimates stop dropping. If earnings get revised down again, those ""cheap"" multiples could suddenly look expensive.

Paycom Software is learning the hard way that in a maturing SaaS landscape, growth without leverage doesn't get rewarded anymore. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) tells the story clearly. Analysts are moving in the wrong direction, expectations are sliding, and sentiment has soured.

Sure, long-term investors might argue Paycom's sticky customer base and best-in-class tech will eventually stabilize results. Maybe. But for now, with estimate revisions heading south and the stock trading below key support, this looks more like a ""sell the bounce"" situation than a ""buy the dip.""

Why Rigetti Stock Is Up 2,800% and What Happens Next

Rigetti Computing, Inc.'s shares have gained more than 2,800% in the past year as investors showed excitement over its quantum breakthroughs. However, Rigetti's weak fundamentals and lofty valuation raised doubts about its future growth trajectory and how investors should position themselves toward the stock. Let's see in detail –

What's Behind Rigetti's Quantum Leap?

Rigetti's shares have soared over the past year as the company secured major contracts and made significant progress in advanced quantum computing technology. Rigetti's 36-qubit quantum system achieved 99.5% accuracy in key operations, marking a breakthrough toward developing a 100+ qubit chiplet-based system by the year's end.

Rigetti signed a $5.8 million deal with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to further develop quantum networking technology. It also received orders for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems worth nearly $5.7 million, scheduled for delivery next year.

Additionally, capital is pouring into the quantum computing sector, benefiting dedicated companies like Rigetti. JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced plans to invest about $10 billion in various innovative fields, including quantum computing. This has driven the stocks of quantum computing companies, including Rigetti, higher.

Rigetti's Massive Gains — Boom or Bubble?

Ongoing contracts and continuous breakthroughs in quantum computing may give Rigetti's stock the momentum needed to keep climbing. However, quantum computing remains in its early stages, and companies in this field require substantial funding for research and development. Rigetti recently completed a $350 million equity offering, providing the company with enough cash to continue operations and easing concerns about funding stability.

Rigetti's business model also offers a competitive edge over rivals and positions it for growth once quantum technology becomes mainstream. The company has its own quantum processing units (QPUs), programming language and the Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform.

Yet, it remains uncertain whether Rigetti can sustain its current explosive growth. The company's fundamentals do not fully support its soaring valuation. Rigetti's operating losses increased 24% year over year to $19.8 million in the second quarter, while revenues fell 42% to $1.8 million, citing investors.rigetti.com.

Furthermore, Rigetti faces stiff competition from larger players like Alphabet Inc., making it a potential takeover target. Additionally, Rigetti's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an astronomical 1,348.30, compared with the Internet - Software industry's 6.28. This indicates the stock is vulnerable to a broader market correction.

Overall, RGTI stock shows signs of being a bubble that could eventually burst. Risk-averse investors should steer clear of the stock, as it remains a speculative investment. Risk-takers may choose to capitalize on the potential growth opportunities. Currently, Rigetti has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Margins, once north of 40%, have come under pressure as the company spends heavily to retain clients and fend off growing competition from the likes of Paylocity, ADP, and Workday. Meanwhile, a sluggish hiring environment means fewer paychecks to process, which means fewer dollars flowing through Paycom's system.

Here's the irony: Paycom's biggest threat might be itself. The company rolled out ""Betty,"" its automated payroll platform, designed to revolutionize how HR departments run payroll by eliminating manual input. The problem? Many of Paycom's existing customers are transitioning to Betty, which actually reduces their usage fees. The innovation cannibalized the cash cow.

When your best new product makes your old one obsolete, Wall Street doesn't cheer, it runs for cover. Analysts have been quick to notice that Betty's rollout, while strategically sound for the long term, is crushing near-term growth.

Once upon a time, investors were happy to pay sky-high multiples for hypergrowth names like PAYC. Now, that multiple compression is brutal. The stock's forward P/E has fallen from the 70s down to the low 20s, and that's assuming the estimates stop dropping. If earnings get revised down again, those ""cheap"" multiples could suddenly look expensive.

Paycom Software is learning the hard way that in a maturing SaaS landscape, growth without leverage doesn't get rewarded anymore. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) tells the story clearly. Analysts are moving in the wrong direction, expectations are sliding, and sentiment has soured.

Sure, long-term investors might argue Paycom's sticky customer base and best-in-class tech will eventually stabilize results. Maybe. But for now, with estimate revisions heading south and the stock trading below key support, this looks more like a ""sell the bounce"" situation than a ""buy the dip.""

Why Rigetti Stock Is Up 2,800% and What Happens Next

Rigetti Computing, Inc.'s shares have gained more than 2,800% in the past year as investors showed excitement over its quantum breakthroughs. However, Rigetti's weak fundamentals and lofty valuation raised doubts about its future growth trajectory and how investors should position themselves toward the stock. Let's see in detail –

What's Behind Rigetti's Quantum Leap?

Rigetti's shares have soared over the past year as the company secured major contracts and made significant progress in advanced quantum computing technology. Rigetti's 36-qubit quantum system achieved 99.5% accuracy in key operations, marking a breakthrough toward developing a 100+ qubit chiplet-based system by the year's end.

Rigetti signed a $5.8 million deal with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to further develop quantum networking technology. It also received orders for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems worth nearly $5.7 million, scheduled for delivery next year.

Additionally, capital is pouring into the quantum computing sector, benefiting dedicated companies like Rigetti. JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced plans to invest about $10 billion in various innovative fields, including quantum computing. This has driven the stocks of quantum computing companies, including Rigetti, higher.

Rigetti's Massive Gains — Boom or Bubble?

Ongoing contracts and continuous breakthroughs in quantum computing may give Rigetti's stock the momentum needed to keep climbing. However, quantum computing remains in its early stages, and companies in this field require substantial funding for research and development. Rigetti recently completed a $350 million equity offering, providing the company with enough cash to continue operations and easing concerns about funding stability.

Rigetti's business model also offers a competitive edge over rivals and positions it for growth once quantum technology becomes mainstream. The company has its own quantum processing units (QPUs), programming language and the Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform.

Yet, it remains uncertain whether Rigetti can sustain its current explosive growth. The company's fundamentals do not fully support its soaring valuation. Rigetti's operating losses increased 24% year over year to $19.8 million in the second quarter, while revenues fell 42% to $1.8 million, citing investors.rigetti.com.

Furthermore, Rigetti faces stiff competition from larger players like Alphabet Inc., making it a potential takeover target. Additionally, Rigetti's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an astronomical 1,348.30, compared with the Internet - Software industry's 6.28. This indicates the stock is vulnerable to a broader market correction.

Overall, RGTI stock shows signs of being a bubble that could eventually burst. Risk-averse investors should steer clear of the stock, as it remains a speculative investment. Risk-takers may choose to capitalize on the potential growth opportunities. Currently, Rigetti has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But now, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, JPMorgan plans to allow institutional clients to use their holdings of Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans by the end of the year.

The offering would store clients’ Bitcoin and Ether holdings through a third-party custodian, according to people who spoke to the news outlet.

As CoinTelegraph's Zoltan Vardai reports, if confirmed, the development could make the two leading cryptocurrencies more attractive for institutional investors, akin to the historic approval of the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January 2024.

A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.

The report follows months of speculation that JPMorgan could soon accept Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as collateral.

JPMorgan continues crypto push

JPMorgan has been considering cryptocurrency-collateralized loans since at least July, when the first reports on this matter emerged.

Still, the Financial Times previously reported that adopting Bitcoin and Ether as collateral assets may not occur until 2026.

JPMorgan was among the first US banks to venture into crypto. In 2020, it launched JPM Coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. In 2024, the bank reported holding shares of different spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The early integration came despite JPMorgan’s CEO previously expressing criticism of digital assets.

In 2018, Dimon said he had no interest in cryptocurrencies.

In 2022, he called digital assets “decentralized Ponzi schemes,” but commented positively on blockchain and smart contract technology.

Lately, Dimon has moderated his stance somewhat, while remaining skeptical.

“I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s investor conference in May.

“I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.”",Zero Hedge,2025-10-24T14:45:00Z,https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/after-decade-bitching-about-bitcoin-jpmorgan-reportedly-plans-allow-crypto-collateral,1.0,2025-10-25 13:50:05.554609,,0.2156862745098038
JPM,JPMorgan Is Betting Big on Quantum Computing. 1 Top-Rated Stock to Buy Now.,,"While the race to define the next era of technology continues, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has just made its move. The banking giant is staking its chips on quantum computing. Under its sweeping “Security and Resiliency Initiative,” JPMorgan plans to deploy $10 billion into frontier technologies, including quantum, as part of a $1.5 trillion decade-long push into strategic sectors.

JPMorgan said it will back companies across all growth stages through financing, advisory support, and capital investment. CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized reducing U.S. dependence on unreliable foreign sources for critical resources and technologies essential to national security.

While JPMorgan is betting on tomorrow’s infrastructure, one name that is hard to miss in this space is Amazon (AMZN). According to Barchart’s analyst consensus, AMZN stock not only commands a “Strong Buy” rating, but it is also being hailed as a top-rated quantum computing stock.

As institutional money lines up behind quantum computing optimism, eyes are bound to lock on Amazon’s cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and growth engines to deliver steady returns.

About Amazon Stock

Amazon is a global technology and e-commerce behemoth headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Today, the company operates across a dazzling range of businesses — cloud services via Amazon Web Services (AWS), digital streaming, subscription services, advertising, physical retail, consumer electronics, and more. Its diversified growth model has placed it among the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market capitalization of $2.35 trillion, and it has a secure position in the “Magnificent Seven” group.

Amazon’s 2025 stock performance has not been very cheery. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, AMZN stock has posted a marginal uptick, making it one of the weakest performers among the “Magnificent Seven” tech name — a striking contrast to many peers rallying strongly amid AI and cloud narratives. Meanwhile, over the past 52 weeks, Amazon has posted a more respectable 20% return.

Although Amazon’s recent underperformance has sparked investor concerns amid slower-than-expected cloud growth, sentiment appears to be turning more positive due to renewed optimism around AWS’ AI initiatives, the infrastructure project “Project Rainier,” and generally bullish analyst outlooks. Amazon’s diversified model, AWS strength, and investments in AI and infrastructure foster confidence in its long-term trajectory.

AMZN stock currently trades at a premium compared to the sector median but below its own historical average at 31.92 times forward earnings.

Amazon Is Progressing in the Quantum Computing Space

Amazon is making significant strides in the quantum computing space through its AWS platform, Amazon Braket. Braket offers access to a diverse range of quantum hardware, including superconducting qubits from IQM and Rigetti Computing (RGTI), trapped-ion processors from IonQ (IONQ), and neutral-atom processors from QuEra Computing. This variety allows researchers and developers to experiment with different quantum technologies to find the most suitable solutions for their needs.

In addition to providing hardware access, Amazon is developing its own quantum hardware. In February 2025, Amazon introduced its first quantum computing chip, Ocelot. Ocelot utilizes cat qubits to enhance error correction, potentially reducing the costs of implementing quantum error correction by up to 90%. This advancement could lead to more efficient and scalable quantum computers in the future.

Earlier this year, AWS also expanded its quantum hardware offerings by adding IQM’s 54-qubit Emerald processor to the Braket platform. This superconducting quantum processor provides higher fidelity gates and dynamic circuit support, enabling customers to explore more complex quantum algorithms.

To further accelerate quantum research, Amazon Braket introduced a feature called “program sets.” This allows users to bundle up to 100 quantum circuits into a single task, reducing processing overhead and execution times by as much as 24 times on supported devices.

Through these efforts, Amazon is positioning itself as a key player in the quantum computing industry, offering both hardware and software solutions to accelerate the development and adoption of quantum technologies.

Amazon’s Q2 Results Surpassed Projections

Amazon reported its second-quarter 2025 earnings on July 31, posting net sales of $167.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year (YOY) and exceeding analyst expectations. Operating income jumped to $19.2 billion, while net income rose to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

The strong performance was fueled by growth across key segments, including 11% sales expansion in North America, 16% expansion in International markets, and a 17.5% increase in AWS revenue.

Furthermore, Amazon guided for Q3 2025 net sales between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, reflecting 10% to 13% growth versus Q3 2024, with expected operating income of $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion, compared with $17.4 billion in the prior-year period.

Analysts remain upbeat, projecting EPS of $6.83 for fiscal 2025, up 23% YOY, then anticipating a further 12% annual increase to $7.67 in fiscal 2026.

Wall Street’s Bullish Bet on Amazon

Amazon has garnered positive attention from analysts, reflecting confidence in its growth prospects. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs raised Amazon’s price target to $275 from $240 and reaffirmed a “Buy” rating. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed Amazon as a top pick ahead of Q3 earnings, noting that investors are underestimating the growth and profit potential of AWS despite increased competition.

Last month, Wells Fargo also upgraded Amazon to “Overweight” from “Equal Weight”, raising its price target to $280 from $245, citing confidence in AWS revenue acceleration driven by Project Rainier as the main driver to reverse the stock’s YTD underperformance.

Wall Street is majorly bullish on AMZN. Overall, AMZN stock has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 57 analysts covering the stock, 51 advise a “Strong Buy” while six suggest a “Moderate Buy"" rating.

The average analyst price target for AMZN is $267.30, indicating potential upside of 19%. The Street-high target price of $305 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 36% from here.",Barchart.com,2025-10-24T14:07:01Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35661658/jpmorgan-is-betting-big-on-quantum-computing-1-top-rated-stock-to-buy-now,1.0,2025-10-25 13:50:18.792681,,0.1450980392156862
JPM,5 Stocks With Robust Sales Growth to Buy Amid a Challenging Backdrop,,"Markets started 2025 strong but soon turned volatile amid tariff and geopolitical risks. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.00–4.25% in September and signaled two more cuts this year. Despite lingering inflation and rising unemployment, equities remain near record highs, fueled by optimism over rate cuts, AI-driven earnings growth and hopes of a soft landing even as a U.S. data blackout adds uncertainty. Against such a backdrop, it is a challenge for retail investors to select the right stocks and generate robust returns.

Therefore, a traditional way of picking stocks is a good idea now. Sales growth provides a more dependable lens for evaluating stocks compared to earnings-focused metrics. Stocks such as Lamb Weston LW, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, FirstEnergy Corp. FE, NetEase, Inc. NTES and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM are worth investing.

When assessing a company, sales growth is mostly preferred over earnings. Steady sales growth reflects the actual demand for a company’s products or services. Focusing on sales also offers investors greater visibility into the durability of a company’s business model. The company that can expand its revenues during periods of economic downturn indicates pricing power, competitive advantages and the ability to capture market share.

On the other hand, earnings can be distorted by one-off charges, cost-cutting, accounting adjustments or temporary margin expansions, making them less indicative of a company’s underlying trajectory.

Moreover, constant sales growth often translates into stronger and more predictable cash flows, providing management with the financial flexibility to reinvest in innovation, expand into new markets or return capital to shareholders, all without excessive reliance on debt. Robust cash reserves and steady cash flow provide companies with the flexibility to counter challenges, pursue growth opportunities and maintain operational stability even in uncertain times.

Selecting the Potential Winning Stocks

To shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow of more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.

But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.

P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.

% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.

Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.

Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

JPM,"JPMorgan (JPM) Upgrades Coinbase (COIN), Sees Potential $34 Billion Opportunity in Base Token",,"Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers.

The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332.

The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts.

JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem.

A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth.

The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said.

While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline.

JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.",CoinDesk,2025-10-24T13:29:00Z,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/24/jpmorgan-upgrades-coinbase-sees-potential-usd34b-opportunity-in-base-token,1.0,2025-10-25 13:50:26.312034,,0.3176470588235294
JPM,"Earnings Look Great, But Keep an Eye on Confidence",,"As of last Friday, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model pointed to 3.9% GDP growth in the current quarter, while their tally of the top 10 forecasting services sees 2.5% growth. If anything threatens to impede growth this quarter, it could be consumer and business sentiment, observes Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates.

The federal government shutdown is expected to impair consumer confidence a bit. But since government tends to impede productivity, the shutdown may actually be a plus.

Still, the National Federation of Independent Business said last Tuesday that its optimism index, a gauge of sentiment among small firms, fell by two points in September to 98.8. Economists expected sentiment to hold steady at 100.8, so the drop in sentiment came as a surprise.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)

Approximately 64% of small business owners said that supply-chain disruptions were affecting their business to some degree. But the index’s uncertainty component rose seven points in August to 100, the fourth-highest reading in more than 51 years. If business sentiment falls, this small business caution could impede fourth-quarter GDP growth.

On the other hand, third-quarter announcement season is off to a great start, with major financial institutions reporting better-than-expected results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy remained resilient despite some “signs of softening, particularly in job growth.” Dimon also said that the economic impact of tariffs “have been less than people expected, including us,” adding that the final outcome of the new tariff negotiations has yet to be seen.

JPM,Why Some Investors Are Taking Profits on JPMorgan After Its Big Rally,,"South Carolina-based Apricus Wealth disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday that it sold 10,784 shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

What Happened

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released on Tuesday, Apricus Wealth reduced its position in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM +2.00%) by 10,784 shares during the third quarter. The estimated value of the shares sold was $3.2 million based on the average closing price for the quarter. The fund holds 3,313 JPM shares worth $1.05 million as of September 30.

What Else to Know

The fund’s remaining stake in J.P. Morgan represents 0.6% of its 13F reportable AUM as of September 30, which places it outside the fund's top five holdings.

Top holdings after the filing:

NYSE:CVX: $5.1 million (2.8% of AUM)

NYSE:MRK: $5.1 million (2.7% of AUM)

NYSE:STT: $5 million (2.7% of AUM)

NYSE:ABBV: $4.8 million (2.6% of AUM)

NYSE:C: $4.7 million (2.6% of AUM)

As of Thursday, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. were priced at $295.04, up 32% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500's 16% gain.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

JPM offers a comprehensive suite of financial products and services, including consumer banking, investment banking, commercial banking, and asset and wealth management.

The bank generates revenue through interest income, fees, trading and investment activities, and asset management services across its diversified business segments.

It serves a broad client base comprising individuals, small businesses, corporations, institutional investors, and government entities worldwide.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a global leader in financial services, operating at significant scale with diversified revenue streams and a strong presence across consumer, corporate, and institutional markets. Its competitive advantage is driven by its size and breadth of offerings.

Foolish Take

Apricus Wealth’s small trim to its JPMorgan Chase stake likely reflects portfolio rebalancing after a strong run-up in the stock, rather than a shift in conviction. The bank’s shares have gained more than 30% in the past year, outpacing both the broader market and its financial peers. With that momentum, some investors appear to be taking modest profits while maintaining exposure to a strong balance sheet within a diversified financial franchise.

JPMorgan’s latest earnings reinforced its dominance in banking, posting $14.4 billion in quarterly profit ($5.07 per share) and a 20% return on tangible equity, buoyed by 14% and 25% gains in investment banking fees and markets revenue, respectively.

For long-term investors, the fundamentals remain solid. CEO Jamie Dimon’s cautious tone on global uncertainty hasn’t dampened JPMorgan’s ability to generate capital or reward shareholders—it repurchased $8 billion in stock last quarter and paid a dividend of $1.50 per share. Apricus’s move doesn’t look bearish; it looks tactical, allowing Apricus to trim exposure and lock in gains while the financial giant continues to deliver strong returns.

JPM,"Why Rigetti Stock is Up 2,800% and What Happens Next",,"Rigetti Computing, Inc.’s RGTI shares have gained more than 2,800% in the past year as investors showed excitement over its quantum breakthroughs. However, Rigetti’s weak fundamentals and lofty valuation raised doubts about its future growth trajectory and how investors should position themselves toward the stock. Let’s see in detail –

What's Behind Rigetti's Quantum Leap?

Rigetti's shares have soared over the past year as the company secured major contracts and made significant progress in advanced quantum computing technology. Rigetti's 36-qubit quantum system achieved 99.5% accuracy in key operations, marking a breakthrough toward developing a 100+ qubit chiplet-based system by the year's end.

Rigetti signed a $5.8 million deal with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to further develop quantum networking technology. It also received orders for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems worth nearly $5.7 million, scheduled for delivery next year.

Additionally, capital is pouring into the quantum computing sector, benefiting dedicated companies like Rigetti. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM announced plans to invest about $10 billion in various innovative fields, including quantum computing. This has driven the stocks of quantum computing companies, including Rigetti, higher.

Rigetti's Massive Gains — Boom or Bubble?

Ongoing contracts and continuous breakthroughs in quantum computing may give Rigetti's stock the momentum needed to keep climbing. However, quantum computing remains in its early stages, and companies in this field require substantial funding for research and development. Rigetti recently completed a $350 million equity offering, providing the company with enough cash to continue operations and easing concerns about funding stability.

Rigetti's business model also offers a competitive edge over rivals and positions it for growth once quantum technology becomes mainstream. The company has its own quantum processing units (QPUs), programming language and the Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform.

Yet, it remains uncertain whether Rigetti can sustain its current explosive growth. The company's fundamentals do not fully support its soaring valuation. Rigetti's operating losses increased 24% year over year to $19.8 million in the second quarter, while revenues fell 42% to $1.8 million, citing investors.rigetti.com.

Furthermore, Rigetti faces stiff competition from larger players like Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and International Business Machines Corporation IBM, making it a potential takeover target. Additionally, Rigetti's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an astronomical 1,348.30, compared with the Internet - Software industry's 6.28. This indicates the stock is vulnerable to a broader market correction.

Overall, RGTI stock shows signs of being a bubble that could eventually burst. Risk-averse investors should steer clear of the stock, as it remains a speculative investment. Risk-takers may choose to capitalize on the potential growth opportunities. Currently, Rigetti has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Radical New Technology Could Hand Investors Huge Gains

Quantum Computing is the next technological revolution, and it could be even more advanced than AI.

While some believed the technology was years away, it is already present and moving fast. Large hyperscalers, such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and even Meta and Tesla, are scrambling to integrate quantum computing into their infrastructure.

JPM,"VantagePoint Vantagepoint A.I. Hot Stocks Outlook for October 24, 2025 Stocks $PSA, $QGEN, $CIEN, $LCID, $GS, $WRBY",,"Register for a Free Live Training

The Hot Stocks Outlook uses VantagePoint’s market forecasts that are up to 87.4% accurate, demonstrating how traders can improve their timing and direction. In this week’s video, VantagePoint Software reviews forecasts for Public Storage ($PSA), Qiagen ($QGEN), Ciena ($CIEN), Lucid Group ($LCID), Goldman Sachs ($GS), Warby Parker ($WRBY)

Public Storage ($PSA)

Hello again, traders, and welcome back to the Hot Stocks Outlook for October 24th, 2025. I hope you all have had an excellent week out there in the financial markets. And as always, we’re going to take a look at the most recent VantagePoint A.I. predictive forecast.

So, if you haven’t already, be sure to go ahead and click the link down in the description below, and get yourself signed up for a live demonstration to learn all the specifics about how these predictive indicators and technologies are helping traders navigate the financial markets and really make better trading decisions.

This is a really nice opportunity. We’ve seen volatility pick up in the marketplace—a good opportunity to really highlight how all of these predictive tools work together.

We can start out here with shares of Public Storage (PSA). And like with all of our previous and subsequent examples, all of this is based off of end-of-day data. Each one of these candles that you see there represents a full and complete trading day.

The first thing we’ll cover here is that right up against all that price data, you’ll notice there is a black line and also a blue line value. The black line that you’re seeing there is a simple moving average—this is a very common technical analysis indicator. The only issue with this indicator is that it always looks back, and in this instance, it’d be a 10-day moving average. So it looks back at the previous 10 close prices, adds them all together, and divides by that number.

That acts as a good baseline to let us know where market prices have been, but it really has no predictive capability—just smooths out what’s already occurred in the market.

What VantagePoint traders are able to do is compare that value to the VantagePoint proprietary predicted moving average. This number, which we can think of as a forecast of average prices looking forward on the chart, is generated through artificial neural networks performing what we would call intermarket analysis.

Rather than just looking back at past prices like traditional technical analysis, the neural networks within VantagePoint are using data from other markets—markets that are known to drive future price action, whether positive or inverse correlations. Neural networks and A.I. are good at identifying these leading and lagging relationships in the data.

This spans the global markets—individual stocks, ETF groups, global currencies, interest rates, and even particular commodities where applicable. Gold mining stocks, oil stocks—these are all driven by movements in the raw commodities themselves.

It takes this global approach, weighing dozens of market relationships, and uses that to generate highly accurate predictions. All of these VantagePoint indicators have a very high level of accuracy associated with their output, and the company continues fine-tuning the neural networks to get the best output possible.

Whenever we see this blue line cross above the black line, that suggests that these average prices should start moving higher and traders may want to look to take a long position. The distance and separation between the predicted moving average and the actual moving average are often good signs of how strong a particular trend might be.

As we look here, as far as that blue line moving above the black line going into just yesterday’s close here in Public Storage (PSA)—and a lot of storage companies generally have performed quite well over the past few weeks—you’ve got a 6–7% move here over the past 19 trading days.

But this is where things get exciting depending on what your trading strategy, approach, and timeframe really are. This is a holistic forecast—it’s not just looking at the overall trend direction. We also have this bar at the bottom of the screen which can go from green to red and back to green.

This indicator has an extremely high level of accuracy—upwards of 80-plus percent—on an extremely wide range of markets. Essentially, four out of five times this indicator will be good at anticipating whether prices will be higher or lower over the next 48-hour period.

We see how this works: as this trend moves to the upside, that neural index gets bullish and we get a lot of momentum in the market until recently, where you see that neural index go bearish, and subsequently, 48 hours later, prices are trading at lower levels.

Additionally, we’ve gone from the predicted moving average (the overall trend), to the neural index (48-hour forecast), and then to the intraday predicted high and low. This indicator utilizes that predictive data—looking at intermarket relationships—but focuses just on tomorrow’s price levels as far as a prediction of the high and the low.

As Friday trades here, we’ll get the actual market data filling in, and we can see how accurate all of those predictions are.

Looking back at previous forecasts, we can see how accurate all of these VantagePoint predictions have been. You really see how this works—getting very close to the predicted lows, moving down toward predicted lows, even seeing how the market tends to respond from those predicted highs and then trades lower from that point.

This is where traders can really utilize this information to make better trading decisions and navigate the markets more effectively. You see about three or four entries very early on here, guiding you every single day moving forward.

Even here, getting a pretty aggressive slant lower as far as that predicted trading range—and then, of course, earnings coming up here in the near future.

A very interesting opportunity again—we see a lot of these storage stocks performing well. This is where the software is very effective at identifying when these sectors start to move, allowing you to hone in on these opportunities.

Qiagen ($QGEN)

Here’s QGEN (Qiagen)—a good example again of how all of these tools work together. The predicted moving average moves above the actual moving average, neural index very bullish, but then we move down to a red configuration and run into sideways price action with subsequent 48-hour periods where that neural index goes bearish.

Once it gets bullish again, we see that momentum pick up in the market. Another day where we run sideways—but overall, clearly a market that’s in an uptrend and you’d only want to be going long and taking profit on long positions.

We see another 6–7% move just over the past few weeks, and of course, those predicted highs and lows can really help refine a lot of this. Understanding that you might want to be buying down at these predicted levels—you see a couple of days ago moving down to the predicted low and then moving up to that actual predicted high from that trading day as well.

Very interesting stuff here and again, good examples of how all the tools work together.

If your trading strategy is shorter term, maybe you want to rely on that neural index and predicted high and low. If you’re looking for position and swing trades, this is where the predicted moving averages can be very effective.

Ciena ($CIEN)

Here in Ciena Corporation (CIEN), this is a stock that really, in April, coming off of the lows, has continued to perform well. Whenever we see this forecast get bullish, it’s a good time to get involved in the market.

We see earnings here and the market really responding well. What’s really effective about VantagePoint is that even when you have these huge volatility catalysts—events that drive volatility in the market, such as big gaps—VantagePoint adapts to those market conditions and understands, “Hey, there’s been a big move here. Let’s look at those intermarket relationships and then generate all of these predictions moving forward from that point in time.”

Even when we see a lot of volatility, the software often does a good job of really adapting—getting back on track and saying, “Okay, where are these levels where we might want to accumulate a position?”

On days like this, if you’re waiting down at the predicted low, you just get filled actually at the open, and you see the market trading straight up from that point.

Many of these opportunities keep trading higher. If we look at this overall position, this has lasted over a very long period of time. As you get into these long, sustained trends, volatility and the daily ranges tend to pick up quite a bit.

You want to identify those early entry points. You see this market up about 85% now, just over the past 41 trading days, with a very solid forecast—the blue line remaining above the black line, letting us know the overall trend is still bullish.

Lucid Group ($LCID)

A couple of weeks ago, we looked at Lucid Group (LCID)—another example of how these tools adapt. As we see this blue line crossing above the black line and the neural index bullish, it really highlighted opportunities to get a position on.

You see how this works and get familiar with it as you utilize the software. Often, on these days where you take up the northern half of the range, the subsequent predicted low levels aren’t hit. The market moves right down to that level and then continues on with its uptrend.

There were numerous opportunities where we had this bullish momentum, the sustained price movement higher, and then you see this very strong move lower as the predicted high and low range and neural index before that trading day turned bearish—and all of that reverses.

The trend moves into a downtrend. You see how these predicted highs and lows now work on the bullish side or the bearish side—moving up toward the predicted high but then selling off.

Even just this past week, moving up to those predicted highs—and you’re already down about 8.5% just over the past few trading days. Clearly, this market is now in a downtrend.

If you want to benefit from the VantagePoint forecast, clearly it’s short—take profits on shorts. Previously, down at 19 was a good opportunity to get long going into early September, but you want to adapt to changing market conditions.

Goldman Sachs ($GS)

A lot of the banking stocks have been performing poorly. We looked at Regions Bank the other day; J.P. Morgan (JPM) and many of the big banks are also performing poorly.

Here we see with Goldman Sachs (GS), the stock very clearly shows the blue line crossing below the black line—again, one of these instances where the neural index gets bullish within a downtrend.

What do you get? Strength over a couple of trading days, but the overall trend is still very much bearish.

We can take a look at these predicted highs and lows and see how this works—even after this trade—saying, “All right, look for the market to trade up toward the upper part of these predicted ranges, but overall still in a downtrend where you’d want to short and take profits on short positions.”

Within 48 hours, you have that market moving down in the direction of the overall trend.

We’ll see if we get some reversals in some of these financial stocks, but currently not a great place to be positioned. The market’s down about 6%, and a lot of stocks are coming off their highs—representing a reason to be cautious.

Many stocks that performed well are now moving into downtrends—an opportunity to get out of the way, reassess, and find new bullish opportunities as we see these predicted moving averages turn bullish once again.

Warby Parker ($WRBY)

Here’s Warby Parker (WBY)—another example of the blue line crossing below the black line, with a lot of separation between the predicted moving average and the actual.

We see how this market just slips into a downtrend and continues moving lower. Very early on, moving up to the predicted high was immediately followed by selling off. Then you get these days where you scoot up toward that predicted high—but clearly, it’s a place to be a seller, not a buyer or accumulator of shares.

Overall, from this initial predicted high being hit, the market is currently down about 21% just over the past 19 trading days. This is the type of stuff you want to avoid—recognizing that conditions have shifted, predictive forecasts are getting bearish, and making sure you’re not on the wrong side of markets when they decline 20-plus percent over a short period.

Once again, this has been the Hot Stocks Outlook for October 24th, 2025. Thank you all for watching—best of luck and by for now.",VantagePoint,2025-10-24T14:05:57Z,https://www.vantagepointsoftware.com/blog/vantagepoint-hot-stocks-outlook-for-the-week-of-october-24-2025/,0.9999999999999999,2025-10-25 13:50:14.765720,,0.4039215686274509
JPM,JPMorgan reportedly plans to let clients borrow against their Bitcoin and Ether,,"Investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase is reportedly planning to let clients use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans, signaling Wall Street’s continued move toward embracing digital assets.

The initiative would allow JPMorgan’s global clients to borrow against their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) holdings, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The offering would store clients’ Bitcoin and Ether holdings through a third-party custodian, according to people who spoke to the news outlet.

If confirmed, the development could make the two leading cryptocurrencies more attractive for institutional investors, akin to the historic approval of the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January 2024.

A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.

The report follows months of speculation that JPMorgan could soon accept Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as collateral.

JPMorgan continues crypto push

JPMorgan has been considering cryptocurrency-collateralized loans since at least July, when the first reports on this matter emerged.

Still, the Financial Times previously reported that adopting Bitcoin and Ether as collateral assets may not occur until 2026.

The investment bank also expressed interest in stablecoins during an earnings call on July 15, when CEO Jamie Dimon said they planned to be involved in stablecoins to better “understand” this emerging asset class.

JPMorgan was among the first US banks to venture into crypto. In 2020, it launched JPM Coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. In 2024, the bank reported holding shares of different spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The early integration came despite JPMorgan’s CEO previously expressing criticism of digital assets.

In 2018, Dimon said he had no interest in cryptocurrencies. In 2022, he called digital assets “decentralized Ponzi schemes,” but commented positively on blockchain and smart contract technology.",Cointelegraph,2025-10-24T13:05:51Z,https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgan-bitcoin-ether-collateral-institutional-report,0.9999999999999999,2025-10-25 13:50:30.632729,,0.3019607843137255
JPM,"JPMorgan To Let Clients Use Bitcoin, Ethereum As Loan Collateral By Year-End: Report",,"JPMorgan Chase plans to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for loans by year-end, Bloomberg reported.

The program will reportedly rely on a third-party custodian for token security.

The move highlights the bank’s growing acceptance of digital assets on Wall Street.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM), one of the largest banks in the U.S., is reportedly planning to let clients use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral for loans by the end of the year.

The bank already allows crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be pledged as collateral. The expansion to direct cryptocurrency holdings marks another step in integrating digital assets into traditional finance. According to a Bloomberg report, the bank’s upcoming program will rely on a third-party custodian to secure the tokens put up as collateral.

JPM’s stock edged 0.14% higher in pre-market trade, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘neutral’ territory over the past day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price rose 1.6% in the last 24 hours to cross $111,000 amid a recovering cryptocurrency market. Retail sentiment around Bitcoin remained in ‘bearish’ territory as chatter dipped to ‘normal’ from ‘high’ levels. Ethereum’s price rose 2% to trade just under $4,000. Retail sentiment around the leading altcoin also trended in the ‘bearish’ zone.

Jamie Dimon’s Evolving Stance On Crypto

The move showcases a gradual shift at JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once said he would fire any trader at his bank if they got caught trading Bitcoin for being “stupid” and that BTC was “fraud”. Just a year ago, at Davos, he called Bitcoin a “pet rock” and said “it does nothing.”

While Dimon has remained skeptical of the sector, his tone has softened. “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” he said at JPMorgan’s investor conference in May, as per Koyfin. “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.”

The bank is now treating crypto more like conventional assets such as stocks, bonds, or gold in its lending operations – a move that aligns with the Trump administration taking a more crypto-friendly stance on the market.

JPM,This Dividend Stock Had a Record Q3: Is It Too Late to Buy After the 40% YTD Surge?,,"In this article:

Citigroup (C) delivered a stellar performance in Q3 2025, with both revenues and profits easily beating estimates. Importantly, all five of its business segments posted record revenues in the quarter, and it showed good progress on the transformation plan under CEO Jane Fraser. Citi is outperforming large U.S. banking peers, including J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC), and is up over 40% for the year.

Citi’s outperformance is not just a 2025 thing, and it has risen about 150% over the last two years, which is well ahead of most of its peers. Along with the capital gains, Citi investors are also rewarded with a generous dividend yield of 2.4%, which is higher than many other large banks. In this article, we’ll examine whether Citi is still a good buy, beginning with a snapshot of the company’s Q3 earnings.

Citi Had a Record Quarter

Banks in general posted a strong set of numbers in Q3. Talking of Citi, America’s third-biggest lender, it posted revenues of $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year (YoY) and ahead of the $21.09 billion analysts expected. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 48% over the period to $2.24, while analysts were expecting the metric at $1.90. The company’s net credit losses rose 2% YoY, but total credit costs fell 8% during the period to $2.45 billion. To sum it up, it was a nice quarter for Citi, where it managed to grow its top line and bottom line while keeping delinquencies in check.

Citi Stock Forecast

After Citi’s Q3 earnings, several brokerages raised C stock’s target price, with Morgan Stanley raising its to a Street-high of $134 while maintaining its “Overweight” rating. The firm’s new estimate implies an upside of 35% over the next 12 months.

The overall Street sentiment is reasonably bullish on Citi, and of the 24 analysts covering C stock, 12 have a “Strong Buy” rating while four rate the stock as a “Moderate Buy.” The remaining eight analysts rate C as a “Hold” or some equivalent.

Citi’s Capital Allocation Policy

One of the key pillars of Citi’s transformation is efficient capital allocation. During the Q3 earnings call, Fraser said that “we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders’ capital, investing it where we should and returning what we don’t deploy.”

As part of the transformation, Citi has exited several markets, which has freed up capital and bumped up its return metrics. The company’s adjusted return on total capital employed was 9.2% in the first nine months of the year, which is now very close to the medium-term target of between 10% and 11% that the company has set. Fraser reiterated her previous views, terming the target a “waypoint, not a destination,” while adding that ""we see a lot of different areas of upside.""

The company has a $20 billion buyback program, and during Q3, it spent $5 billion on share repurchases, which was $1 billion higher than what it guided for. While Citi did not give buyback guidance for the current quarter, CFO Mark Mason hinted that the company would continue prioritizing buybacks. “While we have seen good performance in the stock over the course of the year, we’re still at and around kind of one-times tangible book value, and I think there’s more upside to the stock,” said Mason during the earnings call.

Should You Buy Citi Stock?

Citi has been a play on the transformation and the expected normalization of its valuation multiples.

The transformation has progressed nicely, as summed up by Fraser during the Q3 earnings call: “We have been relentless in our execution, and it is creating results. Over two-thirds of our transformation programs are at or are close to our target state and we are making very good progress in the remaining areas.”

Meanwhile, Citi’s outperformance has also meant that its valuation gap with peers has narrowed. C stock now trades slightly above the tangible book value of $95.72 that it reported at the end of Q3. However, it still trades below the book value per share of $108.41. I believe the next milestone in Citi’s valuation rerating would be the stock rising to its book value, which is not an unreasonable expectation given where its peers trade.

On the dividend front, the company should continue to increase the payouts even as the priority with free cash would be to repurchase shares. Overall, while not a screaming buy as it was when it traded below its tangible book value, Citi is still a decent buy, given the still-low valuations. The dividend yield remains a cherry on top and would only add to the total returns that patient investors make from the stock.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as collateral for loans, marking a major shift in how Wall Street's largest bank integrates digital assets into its core lending operations, according to Bloomberg.

JPMorgan Expands Crypto Collateral Program

The program, set to launch by year-end, will let clients pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for secured loans.

A third-party custodian will safeguard the pledged tokens to ensure risk compliance.

The decision highlights a symbolic reversal for CEO Jamie Dimon, who once labeled Bitcoin a ""hyped-up fraud"" and compared it to a ""pet rock.""

Wall Street's Crypto Integration Accelerates

JPMorgan joins Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT), and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (NYSE:BK) in expanding crypto services.

The Trump administration's pro-crypto stance and recent regulatory rollbacks have helped major banks increase digital asset exposure.

Morgan Stanley is preparing to let users on its E*Trade platform access leading cryptocurrencies in early 2026.

Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity Investments have already begun accepting Bitcoin as part of ETF collateral programs.

Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Vinovest

Vinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine — a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades. With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo Idle Cash

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi Alt Investments

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Range Wealth Management

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

American Hartford Gold

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

JPM,"Here's What JPMorgan Chase Investors Need to Know About CEO Jamie Dimon's ""Security and Resiliency Initiative""",,"Key Points

JPMorgan Chase has committed to funding the growth of many of America’s most important but underfunded companies and industries.

Much of this capital is intended for lesser-known, smaller companies.

JPMorgan Chase’s initiative may be the general direction in which the entire investment industry is moving.

10 stocks we like better than JPMorgan Chase ›

Megabank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is betting on America.

That's the top takeaway from an announcement the company made last week, anyway. The U.S.'s biggest bank measured by assets said it's committing as much as $1.5 trillion to ""facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national economic security and resiliency."" Areas where JPMorgan intends to focus its resources unsurprisingly include technology, energy, and manufacturing a wide range of products in pharmaceuticals, robotics, and industrial materials.

The question the company's shareholders are asking, of course, is: What does this mean for them?

Answer: Quite a bit, actually.

The plan

There's always been something of a line separating investment capital and the sociotechnical direction in which an entire nation is moving. Sure, corporations often seek to influence political policy, and they certainly capitalize on a nation's economic opportunities to grow. Helping ensure that a society is equipped to deal with near-term and long-term challenges, however, is relatively new.

Nevertheless, it's becoming the norm. As JPMorgan Chase's Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon explained in the press release: ""It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing -- all of which are essential for our national security."" He added: ""Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy."" Bottom line? ""America needs more speed and investment."" JPMorgan Chase's commitment to invest as much as $1.5 trillion marks an increase from a previous pledge of $1 trillion.

It won't all be deployed at once. This is a 10-year plan, in fact. The funds aren't simply going toward the purchase of top stocks in the nation's most important industries, either. Indeed, it seems as if the megabank is looking for ways to invest in outfits that aren't exactly big, or even publicly traded.

JPMorgan Chase says it ""will make direct equity and venture capital investments of up to $10 billion to help select companies primarily in the United States enhance their growth, spur innovation, and accelerate strategic manufacturing,"" adding that ""the initiative will also include special, thematic research on private companies and supply chain management issues related to rare earths, AI and technology."" The bank is even hiring all new staff to ensure that this capital is being put to work in the best way possible.

But what does it all mean for JPMorgan shareholders, and does it make this stock an even more compelling buy?

Your top questions answered

The news immediately raised several questions. Here are the top four.

1. Where's the money coming from?

The press release itself never explicitly said as much, but as was largely expected, at least a big chunk of the $1.5 trillion will come from the company's current and future cash hoard created by profits. As Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said during last week's third-quarter earnings call:

We're generating a lot of organic capital. We have a very large excess...an aspiration to add another $0.5 trillion of this type of lending at the margin, that's the type of RWA [real world asset] growth that consumes excess. And obviously, in the context of the excess, $10 billion of direct equity investments that are incremental is a nice deployment of a modest portion of the excess.

For perspective, JPMorgan Chase earned about $44 billion in net income through the first three quarters of this year, but boasts nearly $4.6 trillion in assets.

There's nothing especially unusual about a bank investing a portion of its otherwise-idle money, by the way, even if it is required to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity to cover customer deposits and the like.

This effort also suggests that JPMorgan Chase intends to connect opportunities with third-party capital, via private and public fundraising.

2. Is this an actual investment?

Kudos to JPMorgan Chase and Dimon for being pro-American. Make no mistake, though -- this isn't charity work. Dimon made it very clear during a conference call to discuss the security and resiliency initiative that ""This is not philanthropy. This is 100% commercial.""

3. Is the U.S. government involved?

As pro-America as the plan may be, President Donald Trump isn't involved. Dimon and the program's other overseers have been piecing together the idea for months now. Indeed, in 2023, Dimon wrote that the U.S.'s supply chains of critical products and materials ""must be domestic or only open to completely friendly allies or partners."" This is simply follow-through (with significant embellishment) on that concern.

The only government involvement will be discussions with regulators to figure out ways to ""remove obstacles that stand in the way."" The press release specifically mentioned ""excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need"" as roadblocks that need to be addressed.

4. Is this the shape of things to come?

There was a time when the entire investment industry was content to let businesses and industries do their thing, and then simply let investors decide which were the most promising, risk-adjusted prospects for their capital.

Not anymore, though. The world's become too complicated to assume that companies and industries will grow into what investors hope for, or even expect, them to become. Investors are increasingly looking to become involved earlier in an opportunity's existence, giving them the right to help shape and steer an organization or industry. In many cases, this may well deter a privately held company from ever going public.

It's arguably the right/best direction for the investing intermediary business. As the stock market itself becomes more volatile and less rewarding, capitalism is indeed likely to ease its way toward more privatization and more holistic oversight like the plan that JPMorgan Chase is putting in place now.

Is JPMorgan Chase stock a buy because of this initiative?

The overarching question remains, of course: Does this 10-year, $1.5 trillion investment plan make JPMorgan Chase stock more of a buy that it wasn't before?

The vast majority of investors already saw it as a strong buy. The shares recently fell -- although not by much -- from a record high following a near-200% run-up from their 2022 low. Bullish interest was never in question. But, yes, the initiative does make JPMorgan Chase shares an even more compelling investment prospect than they were just a few days ago.

It's admittedly a bit unusual to see any bank take such a strong, specific interest in the direction a particular country's competitiveness is or isn't moving in. Rather, for most of their history, banks have simply been responsive service providers for whatever the environment was at the time.

The economic and investing environment of 2025, however, is arguably different than it's been in the past.

Take technology, for instance, particularly now that artificial intelligence tools are in the mainstream, and always at your fingertips. The world is incredibly noisy, digitally speaking, overwhelming... well, everyone. Investors aren't immune, creating volatility that causes the stock market itself to be difficult to navigate.

There's also no denying that too few huge companies now make up too much of the overall stock market's total value, while too many small publicly traded outfits aren't actually worth owning. It's the private up-and-comers that offer the real opportunity, but they're difficult to find, let alone invest in. Owning a stake in JPMorgan Chase is an efficient way of indirectly owning these promising start-up enterprises.

So, yes -- JPMorgan Chase stock is an even better buy than it was a little more than a week ago. Its Security and Resiliency Initiative is the sort of proactive effort that all companies need to make in an environment where every aspect of an investment should be well-managed from its very inception. That's all Jamie Dimon is really trying to do. Given his and JPMorgan's track record, this forward-thinking effort is likely to pay off nicely for shareholders.

By the end of the year, the bank will allow institutional clients to pledge Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ether as collateral for loans a first-of-its-kind step for a major U.S. lender. The program, which will use a third-party custodian to safeguard tokens, expands on JPMorgan's earlier acceptance of crypto-linked ETFs as collateral. With Bitcoin rallying this year and the Trump administration easing crypto regulations, JPMorgan's decision signals that digital assets are no longer living on the financial fringe they're entering the mainstream of bank financing.

It's also a symbolic turn for Jamie Dimon. The same CEO who once called Bitcoin a pet rock is now overseeing a bank ready to treat it like any other security. Dimon hasn't become a crypto evangelist far from it but his tone has shifted. I don't think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke, he said earlier this year when asked about Bitcoin ownership. The timing aligns with the sector's resurgence: Bitcoin hit a record $126,251 earlier this month, and investor demand for crypto-based financing is rising fast.

The shift isn't just about JPMorgan. Wall Street's biggest names are moving too. Morgan Stanley is preparing to open crypto access to retail investors via E*Trade next year. State Street, BNY Mellon, and Fidelity have all expanded their custody offerings, while BlackRock has been cleared to let investors swap Bitcoin for ETF shares tracking the token.

JPM,"Why Rigetti Stock is Up 2,800% and What Happens Next",,"Rigetti Computing, Inc.’s RGTI shares have gained more than 2,800% in the past year as investors showed excitement over its quantum breakthroughs. However, Rigetti’s weak fundamentals and lofty valuation raised doubts about its future growth trajectory and how investors should position themselves toward the stock. Let’s see in detail –

What's Behind Rigetti's Quantum Leap?

Rigetti's shares have soared over the past year as the company secured major contracts and made significant progress in advanced quantum computing technology. Rigetti's 36-qubit quantum system achieved 99.5% accuracy in key operations, marking a breakthrough toward developing a 100+ qubit chiplet-based system by the year's end.

Rigetti signed a $5.8 million deal with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to further develop quantum networking technology. It also received orders for two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems worth nearly $5.7 million, scheduled for delivery next year.

Additionally, capital is pouring into the quantum computing sector, benefiting dedicated companies like Rigetti. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM announced plans to invest about $10 billion in various innovative fields, including quantum computing. This has driven the stocks of quantum computing companies, including Rigetti, higher.

Rigetti's Massive Gains — Boom or Bubble?

Ongoing contracts and continuous breakthroughs in quantum computing may give Rigetti's stock the momentum needed to keep climbing. However, quantum computing remains in its early stages, and companies in this field require substantial funding for research and development. Rigetti recently completed a $350 million equity offering, providing the company with enough cash to continue operations and easing concerns about funding stability.

Rigetti's business model also offers a competitive edge over rivals and positions it for growth once quantum technology becomes mainstream. The company has its own quantum processing units (QPUs), programming language and the Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform.

Yet, it remains uncertain whether Rigetti can sustain its current explosive growth. The company's fundamentals do not fully support its soaring valuation. Rigetti's operating losses increased 24% year over year to $19.8 million in the second quarter, while revenues fell 42% to $1.8 million, citing investors.rigetti.com.",Yahoo!

JPM,The Zombie Horde Emerges,,"by David Haggith, Gold Seek:

It’s a low-news day, compared to the last couple of days, so I present just a short editorial. While stocks are still melting down over Trump’s latest and greatest China threats, the most interesting article is a topic I covered in my Deeper Dive a few days back. I want to share a related article by John Rubino that I saved for later when finishing my Deeper Dive, which describes the recent stealth repo crisis connected with the latest troubles in regional banks. Most people heard nothing about this little monster.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

To create more of an editorial, given the lack of editorial-worthy news material, I’ll share a sliver of that Deeper Dive here for everyone.

In essence, banks are getting back to not wanting to lend to each other as the lowering tide starts to reveal a few zombie banks that were swimming without their shorts on. Banks that are barely more decent than the failing ones are running from the water because nobody wants to see half-naked zombies. So, the Fed has had to bail these smaller failing banks out with repo loans on the QT as liquidity gets thinner among banks. (Except wait until you see the size of what they have put on offer with no talk about it!)

First, here’s an excerpt from the Deeper Dive:

Of course the liquidity crisis in shadow banking is what Jamie Dimon fears because shadow banks run to big banks for repo loans when liquidity runs thin, and his bank was THE trigger in the great repo crisis of 2019, which I’ve referred to as the Repocalypse, though I’m not sure I was the first, though I predicted its arrival.

That was when banking froze over because JPMorgan stopped being willing to expand its risks from engagement with the shadow banking sector. So, JPM stopped making repo loans, which are the lubricant that keeps banking smooth. The Fed had to rush to the rescue with massive QE; however, the current inflation-sensitive Fed is loathe to do that because the QE that it leaped into back, once it started getting thrown out of helicopters to the general public half a year later by the federal government is what created the massive inflation we’ve now been fighting back down for years, which all of us are paying for EVERY DAY.

For now, I’ll call this event the “Stealth Repocalypse” or the “Little Repocalypse” until it becomes more pervasive, but a bubble bust of zombie corporations has always been part of my overall scenario for the Everything Bubble Bust I predicted would be slowly forming. While it’s come on more slowly than I thought five years ago, when I placed its peak about 2-3 years out, everything has still consistently been moving in that direction. It’s just that the Fed created so much helicopter money for the masses, and the masses expanded that through stocks more than I realized, that it took longer to drain the new money down than I thought it would. Now things are getting thin as the economy ebbs, and the troubles are starting to show like the bones of a zombie through its thin flesh.

In my Deeper Dive, I went much more into how these factors contribute to the death of the dollar as it is losing its reserve status, and into the shadow banking troubles. I was to briefly focus on Rubino’s piece.

As Rubino describes,

Once again, the regional banks are in trouble. This time, the crisis began with several commercial/industrial loan defaults and is progressing into yet another multi-billion-dollar bailout via the repo market….

On October 16th, 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York quietly injected $8.35 BILLION into the financial system through something called a Repo Operation, and that’s just what they admitted publicly. Nearly 80% of that was backed by mortgage-backed securities, not Treasuries….

When banks start pawning mortgage-backed securities instead of safe Treasuries, it means they’re desperate for cash. It’s like someone pawning their TV, their car, and then finally their wedding ring. And the Fed knows it. That’s why they quietly announced a $491.65 BILLION Standing Repo Facility for later that same day — nearly half a trillion dollars in emergency overnight liquidity. They don’t prep half a trillion unless something behind the curtain is breaking.

That last line is the gist of it. We may soon find out this is as big a deal as the Repocalypes was. In the very least, it is the start of the Zombie Apocalypse, where we start finding out who the Zombie corporations are (described generally as any corporations that don’t make enough money to maintain the interest on their debts if cheap money dries up). I’ve predicted there will be a pretty good zombie horde that emerges during this recession, but the worst part is that the zombies seem to be crawling out in the waning twilight first from the banking sector",SGT Report,2025-10-24T17:20:52Z,https://www.sgtreport.com/2025/10/the-zombie-horde-emerges/,0.6,2025-10-25 13:50:02.992833,,-0.1058823529411764
JPM,Zelle's Stablecoin Move Positions Big Banks For Cross-Border Payments Race,,"Zelle plans to leverage stablecoins to enable faster cross-border payments.

CEO Cameron Fowler credited the move to legislation backed by the Trump administration that aims to integrate stablecoins into the regulated financial system.

Early Warning Services plans to make the offering available to all Zelle Network financial institutions under equal terms.

Early Warning Services, the company behind the payments network Zelle, announced on Friday that it plans on using stablecoins to enable faster, more reliable cross-border money transfers.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

Early Warning Services is owned by some of the biggest banks on Wall Street, which include JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC). The move could expand Zelle beyond its U.S.-based network, where it already facilitates instant payments.

CEO Cameron Fowler credited the move to legislation backed by the Trump administration that aims to integrate stablecoins into the regulated financial system.

“With improved regulatory clarity, we can focus on what we do best: driving innovation to market.”

– Cameron Fowler, CEO, Early Warning Services

Why Is Zelle Venturing Into Stablecoins?

Early Warning Services said its new initiative is designed to address the challenge of “sending money safely and conveniently across borders.”

By leveraging stablecoins, the company said it aims to maintain the same trust, speed, and convenience it already offers its customers while reducing the delays and fees traditionally associated with international transfers.

JPM,"'Pet Rock' No More: JPMorgan To Accept Bitcoin, Ethereum As Collateral",,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as collateral for loans, marking a major shift in how Wall Street's largest bank integrates digital assets into its core lending operations, according to Bloomberg.

JPMorgan Expands Crypto Collateral Program

The program, set to launch by year-end, will let clients pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for secured loans.

A third-party custodian will safeguard the pledged tokens to ensure risk compliance.

The move expands JPMorgan's earlier initiative that accepted crypto-linked ETFs as loan collateral.

It underscores how traditional banks are deepening their exposure to digital assets amid loosening regulations and rising institutional demand.

A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

Dimon's Longtime Skepticism Meets Market Reality

The decision highlights a symbolic reversal for CEO Jamie Dimon, who once labeled Bitcoin a ""hyped-up fraud"" and compared it to a ""pet rock.""

Dimon has since softened his stance, saying at a May investor conference, ""I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it,"" even as he maintains personal skepticism toward the asset.

For JPMorgan, the new framework marks both a cultural and structural shift.

By recognizing Bitcoin and Ethereum as eligible collateral, the bank effectively treats them alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and gold.

Wall Street's Crypto Integration Accelerates

JPMorgan joins Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT), and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (NYSE:BK) in expanding crypto services.

The Trump administration's pro-crypto stance and recent regulatory rollbacks have helped major banks increase digital asset exposure.

Morgan Stanley is preparing to let users on its E*Trade platform access leading cryptocurrencies in early 2026.

Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity Investments have already begun accepting Bitcoin as part of ETF collateral programs.

JPM,This Hot Quantum Computing Stock Keeps Climbing -- Here's What's Driving the Rally,,"Key Points

Rigetti Computing recently sold two of its quantum computing systems -- a positive step.

JPMorgan has announced it will make major investments in the industry, among others.

The total annual value for quantum computing usage could reach $15 billion by 2030.

10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›

Quantum computing stocks have been on a roll recently. Many popular pure-plays in the niche have surged thanks to increased investor interest, company-specific business wins, and an announcement by JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) that it's investing in the quantum computing realm. Among them, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) has risen by nearly 200% since the start of September.

That kind of rapid run-up may give long-term investors pause, as it looks a lot like a hype-cycle bubble. Is that the case for Rigetti, or are there real reasons to invest in the stock now?

Rigetti is selling real quantum computers right now

While Rigetti's stock has surged quite a bit over the past few weeks, it isn't without cause. It is a pure-play with no backup plan; it's quantum computing supremacy or bust. This keeps Rigetti extremely focused on that goal, while some of the legacy big tech players involved in the technology are just looking for some success in the quantum computing realm to bolster their existing businesses.

Rigetti is attempting to take on some of those legacy players head-on with the technology path that it has selected. Unlike some of its peers that are pursuing less common technological paths, Rigetti is using superconducting qubits -- one of the most well-developed and utilized qubit technologies.

When the circuits in these machines are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, they behave in ways governed by quantum mechanics, which allows them to be used to perform quantum computing calculations. This is the same approach that giants like International Business Machines and Alphabet are using, so Rigetti's solution will need to be top-notch to survive.

However, it's already showing some signs of success. Rigetti recently announced sales of two of its quantum computing systems for a total of $5.7 million. That's not a massive sale in the grand scheme of things, but it shows that Rigetti is delivering quantum computing products right now. The Asian manufacturer and California tech start-up that made those purchases likely vetted other quantum computing solutions before deciding on Rigetti's systems, so this is a vote of confidence that its technology is among the best available right now.

Another news item that likely provided some lift to the stock was JPMorgan's announcement that it plans to invest $1.1 trillion over the next decade in industries that it views as critical to national and economic security. Under the umbrella of those investments, a $10 billion fund for 27 specific industries, including quantum computing, was also announced. Rigetti's stock surged 25% following the news, despite no specific announcement that JPMorgan would even invest in it.

However, the reason the cohort of quantum computing stocks surged was that an investment by JPMorgan would add legitimacy to the space, showcasing that a legacy Wall Street institution views quantum computing not just as a futuristic and speculative technology, but as one destined to have a real future. lThis was all exciting news for Rigetti investors, but is it too late to buy the stock now?

Rigetti Computing could have more room to run

If you shift your focus from the next few months to the next decade, it's easier to see how Rigetti could still have room to run. Rigetti estimates that the total annual value for quantum computing usage will be $15 billion to $30 billion between 2030 and 2040. That's not an outlandish projection, and I think it could be a legitimate projection.

However, the industry landscape is highly competitive, and it's unlikely that one company will run away with the lion's share of the market unless its technology is vastly superior to its rivals' offerings. If we project that Rigetti Computing can capture a 25% market share by 2035 and the annual value of the quantum computing market reaches $30 billion by then, Rigetti could be generating $7.5 billion in annual sales.

It's impossible to know for certain what kind of profit margins these companies will generate, but if it can squeeze out a 30% profit margin, Rigetti Computing could generate $2.25 billion in profits. Based on all of those assumptions, and further assuming that it trades at a reasonable 30 times earnings at that point, it would be a $67.5 billion company a decade from now. Rigetti's market cap is $15 billion currently, so that would amount to 350% upside if these projections are correct.

That's solid growth over a decade, but if that projection turns out to be wrong or if Rigetti isn't one of the clear winners in the quantum computing race, it could be worth a lot less. This is a high-risk, high-potential-reward stock, and with a lot of the hoped-for wins already baked into its stock price, the risks are too high for me.

Eventually, another market downtown will arrive, and in its wake, quantum computing stocks will likely be available at far cheaper prices. That's when I'll do my buying, as the quantum computing investment sector has gotten quite hot.

JPM,The Next Financial Crisis May Start On The Blockchain - And JP Morgan Just Opened The Door - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),,"JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) plans to accept Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) as loan collateral by year end 2025. Wall Street analysts frame this as institutional validation. Risk managers should see it differently: a 24/7 volatile asset meeting 9 to 5 banking infrastructure creates contagion pathways that didn’t exist before.

The mechanics reveal why this matters more than typical crypto adoption headlines. Traditional collateral management operates on predictable schedules. Stock markets close at 4 p.m. Eastern. Settlement happens T+2. Risk departments get nights and weekends to stress test portfolios and adjust positions. Banks manage margin requirements using playbooks refined over decades.

Cryptocurrency destroys these assumptions completely.

Bitcoin and Ethereum trade continuously across global exchanges. A 10% intraday move, catastrophic for equities, qualifies as Tuesday for crypto. When JPMorgan accepts Bitcoin as collateral for a corporate loan, it must monitor that position constantly across fragmented liquidity pools. A flash crash at 3 a.m. Sunday could instantly push loan to value ratios into danger zones, triggering automated margin calls before human oversight can intervene.

April 2025’s volatility saw Bitcoin futures markets liquidate $941 million in a single day, with long positions absorbing 90% of losses. Those dynamics played out in crypto derivatives. Now imagine them spreading across corporate credit lines, wealth management portfolios, and institutional loan books.

The Cascade Mechanics

When crypto serves as collateral for traditional loans, price shocks transmit between ecosystems in ways that amplify volatility rather than absorb it. The sequence is straightforward but unforgiving.

Bitcoin drops 15% over a weekend due to regulatory news, exchange issues, or macro shifts. JPMorgan’s risk systems flag hundreds of institutional loans now under collateralized. Automated margin calls go out Monday morning.

Borrowers face a choice: post additional collateral (cash or securities) or face liquidation. Many sell liquid assets to meet calls. As institutions dump stocks, bonds, or additional crypto to cover margin requirements, those markets decline, triggering margin calls at other banks holding similar collateral structures.

Crypto liquidations depress Bitcoin prices further, creating a feedback loop. Traditional market selling pressures equity prices, triggering wealth effects and risk off positioning across asset classes.

This played out within crypto alone during the 2022 winter. Celsius Network’s collapse, triggered by Terra/Luna’s implosion, created $20 billion in losses across 1.7 million accounts. Three Arrows Capital’s $2.4 billion in defaulted loans rippled through Genesis, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital.

Those failures stayed contained within crypto markets. What made them “just” a crypto winter rather than a financial crisis was that major banks weren’t deeply integrated yet. JPMorgan’s collateral program changes that equation.

Five-Stage Liquidation Cascade: How a Bitcoin Price Drop Triggers Systemic Contagion Across Banking and Crypto Markets

What Changed Since 2022

JPMorgan first explored Bitcoin backed lending in 2022 but shelved the project. The timing tells you everything: 2022 was crypto’s disaster year, with cascading platform failures exposing fragilities in lending models that seemed fine during bull markets.

What’s different now? Three factors: regulatory easing under the Trump administration, Bitcoin’s rally above $126,000, and surging institutional demand. But the underlying risks haven’t disappeared. They’ve been papered over by positive price action and favorable regulatory winds.

The European Central Bank’s May 2022 Financial Stability Review warned about crypto integration risks, noting that “increasing interlinkages between crypto assets and the regulated financial system” could amplify shocks. When crypto serves as collateral for traditional loans backing real world economic activity, a crypto crash doesn’t just hurt speculators. It triggers margin calls that reduce lending to Main Street businesses.

Academic research supports this concern. A 2025 study using Time Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression models found that cryptocurrency markets shifted from “shock absorbers” (pre 2020) to “risk transmitters” (post 2020), with turning points coinciding with institutional adoption. As integration deepens, crypto volatility increasingly spills into traditional markets rather than staying isolated.

The Basel III Question

Basel III capital requirements for crypto exposures take effect January 2026. The Basel Committee’s prudential framework imposes punitive capital charges on most cryptocurrencies, potentially requiring banks to hold capital equal to 100% of exposure value for “Group 2” crypto assets.

This creates a regulatory tax that could make crypto collateralized lending economically unviable at scale. If banks must set aside dollar for dollar capital against Bitcoin collateral, capital that could otherwise support 10x that amount in traditional lending, the business case collapses unless loan spreads widen dramatically.

JPMorgan is moving forward anyway, suggesting either confidence that regulations will soften or calculation that reputational and strategic benefits outweigh capital efficiency concerns. Either way, the mismatch between prudential requirements designed for stability and market innovations pushing boundaries creates regulatory gaps where systemic risks hide.

The Custody Risk Nobody Discusses

JPMorgan’s program relies on third party custodians to safeguard pledged tokens, introducing counterparty risk. Unlike traditional securities held at DTCC with deep regulatory oversight, crypto custody remains a fragmented landscape of varying security standards, insurance coverage, and operational maturity.

The 2014 Mt. Gox collapse, 2019 QuadrigaCX scandal, and ongoing exchange hacks demonstrate that custody risk in crypto isn’t theoretical. It’s operational reality. When billions in collateral sit with third party custodians, a security breach doesn’t just hurt the custody provider. It undermines collateral backing potentially hundreds of institutional loans.

This reintroduces the “trusted intermediary” model that cryptocurrency was designed to eliminate. The pitch deck promises decentralization. The reality is institutional crypto increasingly concentrating at a handful of custodians whose failure could trigger system wide crisis.

What to Watch

Several indicators will signal whether these risks remain theoretical or begin materializing:

Cross asset correlations: If Bitcoin drawdowns increasingly correlate with equity market volatility, integration is creating contagion channels rather than diversification benefits.

Liquidation events: Margin call clusters spanning crypto and traditional markets at the same time are early warnings of cascade dynamics.

Bank disclosures: As crypto collateralized loan books grow, transparency around exposure sizes, collateral haircuts, and stress testing methods becomes critical.

Regulatory response: Whether Basel III requirements soften or harden will determine whether this remains niche activity or scales to systemic importance.

The Federal Reserve and ECB have flagged these concerns in recent reports, but concrete supervisory frameworks lag market innovation. That gap between financial engineering and regulatory catch up is historically where crises germinate.

Two Systems That Don’t Speak the Same Language

JPMorgan’s decision represents integration that makes the financial system more efficient in some ways and more fragile in others. This is standard financial innovation territory: solving one problem while creating new ones nobody fully understands yet.

Financial crises rarely announce themselves with obvious warning signs. They emerge from vulnerabilities that seem manageable until they’re not. Subprime mortgages in 2008. Long Term Capital Management’s excessive borrowing in 1998. Portfolio insurance in 1987.

Each time, sophisticated institutions convinced themselves they’d properly modeled the risks. Each time, the models failed when stress hit from unexpected directions and correlations that were supposed to stay low suddenly spiked to one.

Crypto collateralized lending at systemically important banks might prove perfectly safe. Or it might be the next fragile node in a financial system that’s added complexity faster than resilience. JPMorgan’s decision to open this door after closing it in 2022 means we’re about to find out.

The real question isn’t whether this specific program causes the next crisis. The question is whether anyone’s actually figured out how to manage 24/7 volatility using risk systems designed for markets that close at 4 p.m. and settle in two days. Based on how similar innovations worked out historically, there’s reason for skepticism.",Benzinga,2025-10-24T13:56:29Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48404891/the-next-financial-crisis-may-start-on-the-blockchain-and-jp-morgan-just-opened-the-door,0.5,2025-10-25 13:50:21.967638,,-0.09019607843137256

However, the industry landscape is highly competitive, and it's unlikely that one company will run away with the lion's share of the market unless its technology is vastly superior to its rivals' offerings. If we project that Rigetti Computing can capture a 25% market share by 2035 and the annual value of the quantum computing market reaches $30 billion by then, Rigetti could be generating $7.5 billion in annual sales.

It's impossible to know for certain what kind of profit margins these companies will generate, but if it can squeeze out a 30% profit margin, Rigetti Computing could generate $2.25 billion in profits. Based on all of those assumptions, and further assuming that it trades at a reasonable 30 times earnings at that point, it would be a $67.5 billion company a decade from now. Rigetti's market cap is $15 billion currently, so that would amount to 350% upside if these projections are correct.

That's solid growth over a decade, but if that projection turns out to be wrong or if Rigetti isn't one of the clear winners in the quantum computing race, it could be worth a lot less. This is a high-risk, high-potential-reward stock, and with a lot of the hoped-for wins already baked into its stock price, the risks are too high for me.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-24T11:00:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/24/hot-quantum-computing-stock-keeps-climbing-heres/,0.5,2025-10-25 13:50:35.612070,,0.1764705882352942

The expansion underscores how quickly crypto is being pulled into the financial system’s core plumbing. With Bitcoin rallying this year and the Trump administration rolling back regulatory hurdles, major banks are starting to bring digital assets deeper into the lending system.

For JPMorgan, it’s both a symbolic shift and a functional one: the bank whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, earlier dismissed Bitcoin as a “hyped-up fraud” or a “pet rock” is no longer treating crypto as a fringe bet. Instead, it will be pledged as security for a loan, the same way stocks, bonds, gold and other familiar assets are.

Lately, Dimon has moderated his stance somewhat, while remaining skeptical. “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s investor conference in May. “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.”

JPMorgan is far from the only established Wall Street firm to dive deeper into digital assets lately, as the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance and subsequent regulatory easing has helped them get more comfortable with the risk.

For instance, Morgan Stanley plans to allow customers on its E*Trade retail platform to access to popular cryptocurrencies beginning in the first half of next year. Other firms to get in on the action include State Street Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Fidelity, offering services like crypto custody.

A recent regulatory change also allowed firms like BlackRock Inc. to accept investors’ Bitcoin and swap them for ETF holdings tracking the token.

JPMorgan first began exploring lending against Bitcoin in 2022 but the project was later shelved, said the people, who asked not to be named because the bank’s plan is not yet public.

JPM,Blackstone's $1.2 Trillion Machine Is Back in Motion -- And Deals Are Flowing Fast,,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Blackstone (NYSE:BX) has reignited investor optimism after reporting a 48% surge in third-quarter distributable earnings, driven by a wave of private equity exits and renewed deal activity. The world's largest alternative asset manager posted $1.89 billion in distributable profit, or $1.52 a share, beating consensus estimates. President Jon Gray described the environment as a major inflection point, noting that the deal dam is finally breaking. With assets under management climbing to $1.2 trillion and inflows exceeding $50 billion for the fourth straight quarter, Blackstone's credit and insurance division remained the firm's anchor of growth. Despite shares being down 6.2% year-to-date, investors appear to be positioning for a cyclical rebound in private markets.

In an interview, Gray pushed back on recent comments from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who suggested that bank losses tied to subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings could hint at deeper credit cracks. Gray countered that such instances seem idiosyncratic, rather than systemic. His remarks followed a quarter where Blackstone more than doubled proceeds from asset sales compared with a year ago and took three portfolio companies public an encouraging sign that the freeze in dealmaking may be easing as financing conditions improve.

Under the surface, the firm's strategic bets on infrastructure are paying off. That segment delivered a 5.2% return, powered by investments in data centers, grid assets, and clean energy the foundational picks and shovels for the AI revolution. Gray noted that while enthusiasm around new technologies can fuel valuation spikes, today's leaders are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets. With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain a gradual easing stance, and AI reshaping demand for physical and digital infrastructure, Blackstone could be entering a new phase where capital once again moves swiftly and profitably through its vast ecosystem.",Yahoo!

JPM,Money 20/20 USA 2025: Key themes to look out for: By Laurent Descout,,"It’s that time of year again! Money20/20 USA is returning and promises to be bigger, bolder and more future-focused than ever.

From October 26-29, over 11,000 from the money community are set to descend on Las Vegas’s Venetian Hotel to build influential partnerships, accelerate deals and explore the key trends driving innovation in fintech.

This year’s theme, “Create the Future,” sets the stage for an ambitious agenda built around four content pillars exploring the evolution of fintech.

Fintech Spring: Is this finally the moment ‘fintech’ becomes ‘financial services’?

Age of Infrastructure: Will fintech’s next wave of innovation be ‘invisible’?

Global Payments Race: Is the potential of money movement limitless AND borderless?

Securing Trust: How does our financial system secure trust in uncertain times with increasing fraud?

With these talking points in mind, we’ve taken a closer look at the core themes we think will dominate this year’s event.

AI takes centre stage

Already a buzzword in finance and tech, AI is set to get even more attention at this year’s event.Unsurprisingly, there are several panels at this year’s conference dedicated to exploring the impact of AI on finance.

Specifically, significant attention is being given to the role of AI in payment systems. Monday morning kicks off with the session ‘Act to Transact: Empowering AI Agents to Pay.’ In this panel, Hilary Packer of American Express, Jacqueline O’Flanagan of Microsoft, Mackenzie Sigalos of CNBC and Marco Mahrus of OpenAI, will explore the future of AI payment systems and the logistics of connecting AI models with payment rails while keeping data safe.

The practicality of integrating AI into systems is also a key focus. Another session, ‘Fintechs Using AI to Cut Costs and Gain Market Share’ will examine how automation helps fintechs reduce costs, enhance accessibility, and compete with larger incumbents.

The rise of stablecoins

Stablecoins have been one of the standout trends of 2025, with adoption gaining real momentum across payments and financial services. Banks and PSPs are increasingly launching their own stablecoins, such as PayPal’s PYUSD or JPMorgan Chase’s JPM Coin.

Supportive regulations like the U.S. Genius Act and the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) have helped stablecoins move from niche crypto tools to mainstream commerce solutions. By pegging value to fiat currencies, stablecoins avoid volatility, enabling faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments.

The 'Crypto Payment Barriers Burning Down' panel, which will comprise of May Zabaneh of PayPal, Melissa Netram of Block and Keith A. Grossman of MoonPay, will deliver an actionable 6-12-month roadmap for using digital assets, such as stablecoins, in payments by analysing integration strategies, consumer adoption triggers and infrastructure scalability.

The aptly titled panel discussion ‘Have Stablecoins Found Their True Purpose?’ will feature Michael Shaulov, Co-founder and CEO, Fireblocks, and Gilles Gade, CEO at Cross River, exploring real applications of stablecoins, the current regulatory landscape assessment and practical realities of implementation.

Instant payments as standard

Instant payments are transforming finance, simplifying reconciliation, enhancing user experiences and reducing costs.

In the EU, the full implementation of the Instant Payments Regulation means all banks and PSPs in the Eurozone to send and receive money within 10 seconds, with additional controls on pricing parity and Verification of Payee.

In the U.S., real-time payments are gaining traction via FedNow and the Clearing Houses’ RTP Network, even as adoption volumes remain modest.

As such, instant payments continue to dominate financial services discussions, and this is the case at Money20/20 USA this year. In the panel discussion ‘The Power of Instant Payments,’ Nick Stanescu, Chief FedNow Executive at the Federal Reserve, Glenn Wheeler, VP at Catalyst Corporate Union, and Neetu Bhagat, CFO at Origence, will discuss how the payment industry is addressing the challenges of instant payments and capitalising on opportunities for innovation.

Another interesting panel discussion will be ‘Global Payments Race: Redefining B2B and Fintech Strategies in a Borderless Era.’ This session will explore how the global payments landscape is being reshaped by the increasing importance of interoperability across borders, the rapid adoption of instant payments and the impacts of regulation on cross-border flows.

As changing expectations and technological developments continue to drive progress in the financial industry, Money2020 continues to serve as a vital barometer for the pace and status of financial innovation, and the drive to make processes cheaper, faster and more secure.

We look forward to being amongst the conversations at Money 20/20 and hearing about the future of money, exploring the evolution of AI, stablecoins and instant payments.",Finextra Research,2025-10-23T15:20:09Z,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29653/money-2020-usa-2025-key-themes-to-look-out-for,0.5,2025-10-25 13:51:31.025547,,0.2784313725490195
JPM,"Wall Street Banks Come to the ""Rescue"" of Milei's Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections | naked capitalism",,"JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg:

[B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan.

Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package.

There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package:

Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament.

Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days.

What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”?

An Oligarch’s Libertarian

It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy:

Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test.

Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency.

Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators.

Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso.

To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short.

From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling

Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge.

This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua.

After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer.

This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”:

[S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”.

Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled.

However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April.

What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling:

Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month.

Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people?

Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money.

In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.”

An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025.

Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy.

In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly):

At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses.

In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country.

Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury.

At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies.

One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets.

Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line.

Another source of embarrassment for the Fund:

Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”:

When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these…

So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder?

The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest.

In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex.

Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China.

Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles.

Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications.

The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.

If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off.",naked capitalism,2025-10-24T10:42:44Z,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/wall-street-sends-in-its-big-guns-to-save-mileis-argentina-just-days-before-make-or-break-elections.html,0.4,2025-10-25 13:50:40.562880,,0.3333333333333333
JPM,Tech stocks surge: Semiconductors and consumer cyclical sectors lead the rally | investingLive,,"Sector Overview

The US stock market is witnessing a robust day with the semiconductor sector outperforming markedly. Broadcom (AVGO) leads the pack, enjoying an impressive rise of 2.42%, followed closely by Micron Technology (MU) with gains of 3.92%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also shows significant growth with a 1.52% increase. This showcases a bullish sentiment among investors towards tech innovations.

Meanwhile, the consumer cyclical sector is showing resilience, driven by Amazon (AMZN)'s climb of 1.02%. However, not all companies are riding this wave; Tesla (TSLA) experiences losses, down by 2.20%, highlighting investor caution in the auto manufacturing space.

Market Mood and Trends

The overall market sentiment is hopeful, primarily buoyed by the technology and consumer cyclical sectors. Investors appear to be optimistic about the economic recovery, betting on increased consumer spending and advancements in technology to bolster future profits. The mixed results elsewhere indicate a more nuanced approach as traders weigh the day’s market dynamics and macroeconomic signals.

Strategic Recommendations

For investors looking to capitalize on current trends, enhancing exposure to the thriving semiconductor and consumer cyclical sectors may be prudent. Monitoring high-performing stocks like Google (GOOG), which has surged 2.75%, could present lucrative opportunities. Traders might also keep an eye on volatility within the auto manufacturing space, given Tesla (TSLA)'s volatility.","News & Analysis for Stocks, Crypto & Forex | investingLive",2025-10-24T14:46:33Z,https://investinglive.com/stock-market-update/tech-stocks-surge-semiconductors-and-consumer-cyclical-sectors-lead-the-rally-20251024/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-25 13:50:05.554151,,0.2549019607843137
JPM,Stablecoins that scale: 5 tests for real-world money,,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The promises of stablecoins are clear: it’s a way to fuse the low-cost, speed, and transferability of digital assets with the certainty of traditional currency. At the upper bounds of what is possible, stablecoins may become the new standard of payment in the same way payment cards are replacing cash.

But living up to these promises means being able to scale. It’s relatively simple to make a stablecoin; it’s much less simple to make one that’s going to be just as usable at 100 transactions per day as it is at 100,000.

This was the focus of the late-morning keynote on the London Blockchain Conference’s Visionaries Stage: Stablecoins that scale: Five tests for real-world money.

The designated hitter was Dr. Berhnhard Kronfellner from Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Surveying the crowd, he muses that perhaps stablecoins don’t need five tests at all, because there’s a more useful indicator already in the room with us.

“The crowd has changed from people wearing hoodies to people that are wearing suits. So this is actually – without the five tests – the first indicator that stablecoins and digital assets have already become in the interest of the big banks, the big brands, and it will be the world’s new money.”

Nonetheless, Dr. Kronfellner sets out the five tests:

Additional value

Use cases

Revenues

Regulations

CBDC-Co-existence

To start with ‘additional value,’ Dr. Kronfellner shows two images side by side: one warped, pot-hole-stricken road, and another smooth, 20-lane megahighway. Stablecoins, in essence, are the megahighway.

In a world of innovations, things like booking overseas accommodation have been disrupted by Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and have never been easier. But when you want to transfer money to the other side of the world, you could be looking at five banking days.

Stablecoins can do for money what Airbnb did for accommodation, in other words.

Dr. Kronfellner lists five benefits stablecoins help unlock:

Lightning-fast transactions

Reduced transaction costs

Enhanced transparency

Programmability and automation

Global accessibility and financial inclusion

He also reminded the crowd that the real use cases these benefits might transform into are still being discovered.

“When a new technology like the Internet 20 years ago—with exchanging emails, first webpages, and so on—no one had a clue that 20 years later, with Instagram, we might see influencers that have followers and make a good living out of it.”

The message is this: the use cases that we see right now, such as crypto trading, are just the beginning. Five or ten years from now, perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) agents will help us exchange money, buy things, and invest.

Another question: Are companies across the value chain building viable business models? It’s not enough to merely have a use case for stablecoins; the use case has to make money.

Some certainly are, Dr. Kronfellner explained. Tether made $13 billion in profit last year from a mere 100 employees. Little wonder, then, that banks are expending effort to enter the space.

Exactly what form the banks’ entry into stablecoins might take is an open question. Dr. Kronfellner discusses the potential avenues banks are exploring—they could offer wallets or custody, issue their own stablecoin, create a consortium with others to issue a stablecoin, issue tokenized deposits (as JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) has done), or they could simply do nothing, and wait and see which coins emerge as the winners.

“For some banks, this makes sense. They will see that the revenue will be reduced and decrease in cross-border transactions or other typical stablecoin use cases and some clients will go away. But not being a first-mover, for a tier 3 bank, might be good.”

Regardless, Dr. Kronfellner says that BCG sees stablecoins as a net opportunity for banks. The downsides are reducing; the upsides are growing.

What’s next? Dr. Kronfellner says he sees a run for APYs. Soon, people will keep stablecoins in their wallets as a store of value and start questioning how they can get yields on their portfolio as they do with cash. New platforms may emerge from traditional banks or payment service providers to offer people an APY on stablecoins.

AI agents are another area Dr. Kronfellner anticipates growing: AI agents will help us to use our stablecoins in our wallets to transfer money, or we can ask our AI agent to find out if there’s a cheap way to buy into the building with X amount of money. If the apartment building is already tokenized, the AI agent will return with a quote of how much fractional ownership would cost.

Dr. Kronfellner kept returning to the same point—from the banking perspective, the upsides for stablecoins are growing, while the downsides are starting to disappear.

XOM,This Sector Is About to Surge: 2 Energy Stocks Set to Breakout,,"Oil prices have been trending lower all year, recently testing a key level of support. But that narrative shifted sharply this week. Following a fresh round of US sanctions targeting Russian oil exports and putting major buyers like India and China in the crosshairs, WTI crude has surged nearly 10% just this week off its lows.

After months of rising supply and weakening prices, this escalation has sparked a powerful rebound in oil and reignited momentum across leading energy names. Par Pacific (PARR) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) stand out for their strong price action, healthy cash flows, and favorable Zacks Ranks.

With crude prices firming, interest rates moving lower, and the broader economy still resilient, energy stocks may be on the cusp of a new bull run, ending nearly two years of stagnation.

Exxon Mobil: Stock on the Verge of Major Breakout

Exxon Mobil stands out as one of the most technically compelling setups in the entire energy sector. While it does not currently enjoying upward trending earnings estimate revisions, its chart and massive cash flows more than make up for it.

From a fundamental perspective, Exxon’s position remains exceptionally strong. The company is generating a free cash flow yield of roughly 6.9%, well above its 10-year median of 4.8%. Exxon has steadily used its massive cash generation to fund dividends, repurchase shares, and invest in new energy projects, all while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets among global majors.

Turning to the technical picture, the real story here unfolds on the long-term chart. For over two years, XOM’s stock price has been consolidating within a broad, well-defined trading range. This sideways movement has formed a large bull flag pattern, suggesting that the stock has been quietly building energy for its next major move.

Currently, XOM is pressing against the upper boundary of that pattern around the $117 resistance level. A decisive breakout above this zone would mark the stock’s first significant move to new highs since late 2024 and could trigger a powerful upside continuation. With crude oil prices rebounding sharply in recent sessions, this breakout setup may finally be primed to play out.

Parr Pacific: Shares Rally on Earnings Upgrades

Par Pacific has seen a dramatic turnaround in sentiment thanks to a wave of upward earnings revisions over the past two months, earning it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Analyst estimates have surged by as much as +249% for the next quarter and +113% for the current year, reflecting a sharp improvement in profitability expectations as refining margins and demand dynamics strengthen. Despite this upgrade cycle, the stock remains attractively valued, trading at just 10.4x forward earnings.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

From a technical standpoint, PARR has been one of the standout performers in the energy sector. Until recently, the stock had been coiling within a bullish momentum pattern, suggesting a buildup of buying pressure beneath the surface. That tension finally released this week, as shares staged a major breakout, confirming the bullish setup that had been developing for months.

While the initial breakout move may have already played out, the combination of improving fundamentals, favorable industry trends, and strengthening oil prices suggests there could still be meaningful upside ahead. Even after the surge, PARR remains a compelling mid-cap energy name benefiting from both earnings momentum and sector tailwinds.

Image Source: TradingView

Should Investors Buy Shares in XOM and PARR?

After nearly two years of sluggish performance, the energy sector is starting to show signs of life again. The combination of rebounding oil prices, easing financial conditions, and resilient global demand is creating the perfect setup for a renewed uptrend in select energy names.

Exxon Mobil offers a steady, large-cap way to play the move, backed by strong free cash flow, a reliable dividend, while Par Pacific brings higher volatility but also higher return potential. With surging earnings estimates and a confirmed technical breakout already underway.

Together, they offer balanced exposure to what could be the start of a powerful new bull phase in energy stocks.

Zacks Investment Research

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",NASDAQ Stock Market,2025-10-24T15:39:00Z,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sector-about-surge-2-energy-stocks-set-breakout,1.0,2025-10-25 13:51:39.730003,,0.2313725490196079
XOM,Analysts Estimate Exxon Mobil (XOM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This oil and natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.3%.

Revenues are expected to be $86.77 billion, down 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exxon?

For Exxon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.17%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exxon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exxon would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of +10.07%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Exxon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

XOM,Exxon Mobil's Q3 2025 Earnings: What to Expect,,"Spring, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) operates as the largest American oil & gas company. It engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and internationally. Valued at $489 billion by market cap, Exxon operates through Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments.

The energy giant is set to release its third-quarter results before the markets open on Friday, Oct. 31. Ahead of the event, analysts expect Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP profit of $1.78 per share, down nearly 7.3% from $1.92 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. On a positive note, the company has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.

For the full fiscal 2025, analysts project Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of $6.79, down 12.8% from $7.79 in fiscal 2024. However, in fiscal 2026, its earnings are expected to rebound 10.5% year-over-year to $7.50 per share.

XOM stock prices have declined 3.6% over the past 52 weeks, notably lagging behind the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLE) marginal 94 bps dip and the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 16.2% gains during the same time frame.

Exxon Mobil’s stock prices dropped 1.8% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Aug. 1. The quarter was marked by the highest Q2 upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago. It was also the company’s best quarter yet for high-value product sales volumes in product solutions. However, due to lower commodity prices, the company’s topline for the quarter dropped 12.4% year-over-year to $81.5 billion, missing the consensus estimates by 1.6%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS dropped 23.4% year-over-year to $1.64, but surpassed the Street’s expectations by 10.1%.

Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the stock’s longer-term prospects. XOM maintains a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” 10 “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.” Its mean price target of $126.12 suggests an 8.7% upside potential from current price levels.",Barchart.com,2025-10-24T06:37:23Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35653319/exxon-mobil-s-q3-2025-earnings-what-to-expect,1.0,2025-10-25 13:51:59.588231,,0.3019607843137255
XOM,3 Integrated Energy Stocks Standing Tall Despite Soft Oil Price,,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects rising inventories of oil to hurt crude prices. The soft crude pricing environment is thus likely to affect the integrated energy players' exploration and production operations. At the same time, the rising demand for renewable energy adds uncertainty to the prospects of the Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry, creating a bleak outlook.

Among the companies in the industry that will probably survive the business challenges are Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP.

About the Industry

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry covers companies primarily involved in upstream, midstream and downstream operations. These companies have upstream businesses in the United States (including prolific shale plays and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico), Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and Europe. Midstream operations of energy companies entail transporting oil, natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products. In downstream businesses, the firms buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products. The companies’ downstream activities involve chemical businesses that manufacture raw materials for making plastics. The integrated players are now gradually focusing on renewables, leading to the energy transition. The firms aim to lower emissions from operations and cut the carbon intensity of the products sold.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Industry

Soft Oil Price to Hurt Cash Flows: In its latest short-term energy outlook, EIA projected the average spot price for West Texas Intermediate crude at $65 per barrel for 2025 and $48.50 per barrel for 2026. Both the projected prices were significantly lower than $76.60 per barrel in 2024, per EIA data. The expectation for lower oil prices will probably lead to a decline in cash flows from the upstream business.

Slowdown in Production Growth to Hurt Upstream Business: There has been a slowdown in oil production growth in the upstream businesses of integrated energy companies in the United States due to shareholder demands for a greater focus on returning capital rather than investing in production expansion. As production growth slows, output decreases, which can lead to reduced revenues. Since upstream operations depend heavily on volume to generate income, any stagnation in production growth has a direct and negative impact on their bottom line.

Growing Demand for Renewables a Concern: Governments, investors and stakeholders are placing growing emphasis on addressing climate change, leading to an increased demand for renewable energy. Consequently, the demand for products reliant on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids is expected to decline, with solar and wind energy gaining prominence in the energy landscape. The integrated energy firms are adversely impacted by these trends as they are primarily engaged in the production and transportation of fossil fuels, such as oil, and selling refined petroleum products.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Prospects

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry is part of the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #220, which places it in the bottom 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.

The industry has gained 3.6% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s surge of 19% and the broader sector’s improvement of 4.8%.

One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation

Since oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt.

On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 4.50X, lower than the S&P 500’s 18.57X. It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 5.05X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.54X and as low as 2.75X, with a median of 4.12X.

3 Integrated International Stocks to Keep a Close Eye on

BP has been investing heavily in oil and natural gas operations since it estimated that 55% of the global energy is generated from the commodities. Currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the British energy giant is planning upstream capital investment of $10 billion through 2027, a notable increase from $8.5 billion in 2024. With key oil and gas projects yet to come online, BP expects to increase its daily production volumes to 2.3 million to 2.5 million barrels in 2030. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Price and Consensus: BP

In the Permian, the most prolific basin in the United States, ExxonMobil has a strong presence. By the end of this decade, the energy major aims to boost its Permian production to 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoE/D), from roughly 1.6 MMBoE/D volumes it produced in the June quarter, thanks to the advanced technologies employed to enhance well recoveries.

In offshore Guyana, XOM has made massive oil and gas discoveries over the years, estimating the recoverable reserves at 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Notably, XOM carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Price and Consensus: XOM

Chevron is an integrated energy giant with a stable business model. In the Permian, the most prolific basin in the United States, CVX, with a Zacks Rank of 3, has a strong footprint. Also, the company’s downstream business is benefiting from the softer oil prices.

Price and Consensus: CVX

XOM,Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Rises On US Sanctions Against Russian Oil - Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM),,"Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) shares are trading marginally higher Thursday, benefiting from a sector-wide rally after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. The news sent West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 5% to above $61 a barrel.

XOM is performing well relative to peers. Stay ahead of the curve here.

What To Know: These sanctions are causing XOM stock to rise due to the basic principles of supply and demand. By targeting major Russian producers, the U.S. is effectively removing a significant amount of oil from the global market. This reduction in supply, assuming demand remains constant, drives the price of crude oil higher.

For an integrated oil and gas company like Exxon Mobil, higher oil prices directly translate into greater revenue and higher profit margins for every barrel it produces and sells. Investors anticipate this boost to Exxon’s profitability, making the stock more attractive and pushing its share price upward.

Traders and investors are meanwhile watching for Exxon’s upcoming earnings report on October 31. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.81 per share on revenue of $84.87 billion for the quarter.

Benzinga Edge Rankings: According to Benzinga Edge stock rankings, the company boasts a strong Value score of 77.65.

XOM Price Action: Exxon shares were up 0.98% at $115.83 at the time of publication on Thursday. The stock is trading within its 52-week range of $97.80 to $123.21.

From a technical perspective, Exxon is trading approximately 3.1% above its 50-day moving average of $112.09 and about 5.2% above its 200-day moving average of $109.82.

These indicators suggest that the stock is in a bullish trend, with the potential for further gains if it can maintain its position above these key moving averages.

How To Buy XOM Stock

By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Exxon Mobil – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.

In the case of Exxon Mobil, which is trading at $115.83 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 0.86 shares of stock.

If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell.

XOM,This 3 Stocks Portfolio Provides Monthly Income,,"While the majority of stocks pay quarterly dividends, investors can still construct a portfolio that allows them to get paid monthly.

How? Let me explain –

The first stock pays its dividend in January, April, July, and October. The second stock pays out in February, May, August, and November. And finally, the third stock will pay its dividend in March, June, September, and December.

So, with just a little positioning, investors can reap steady monthly paydays.

Together, three stocks – Coca-Cola Company KO, AbbVie ABBV, and Exxon Mobil XOM – would allow payouts to roll in each month.

For income-focused investors, let’s take a closer look at each one.

Coca-Cola Keeps Paying

Coca-Cola is an American multinational corporation best known for its flagship Coca-Cola beverage. Shares have nearly matched the S&P 500’s performance in 2025 so far, gaining 17%.

Notably, KO is a Dividend King, showing an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased payouts. The company’s annual yield currently sits at 3.0%, also boasting a 4.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on an annual basis. Please note that the final value is tracked on a trailing twelve-month basis, as the company’s current fiscal year is still ongoing.

KO pays dividends in January, April, July, and October.

AbbVie Outperforms

AbbVie enjoys leadership positions in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, eye care, and women’s health. Shares have outperformed nicely in 2025 so far, up 35%.

Like KO, AbbVie is a Dividend King, reflecting the company’s shareholder-friendly nature in a big way. Currently, ABBV’s annual dividend yields a sizable 2.8%, with the company also sporting a 6.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on an annual basis.

ABBV pays dividends in February, May, August, and November.

XOM Generates Serious Cash

Exxon Mobil is a U.S.-based oil and gas entity, one of the world's largest publicly traded energy companies. Shares have underperformed relative to the S&P 500 in 2025 so far, gaining 8%.

Exxon’s annual dividend yield currently stands at a solid 3.5%, with the company carrying a 3.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on an annual basis.

XOM pays dividends in March, June, September, and December.

Bottom Line

Dividends can amplify any portfolio, cushioning the impact of drawdowns in other positions and providing the ability to reap passive income.

And if investors select their dividend-paying stocks in a structured manner, they can create a portfolio that provides monthly paydays.

When combined, all three stocks above – Coca-Cola Company KO, AbbVie ABBV, and Exxon Mobil XOM – construct a portfolio that allows for monthly income.

XOM,Wells Fargo Suggests 2 Energy Stocks to Buy in a Challenging Market,,"In recent months, ExxonMobil has been expanding its production capabilities, in addition to boosting its refining capabilities. In September, the company expanded its output in its Guyana offshore projects, opening a seventh development that will have an output capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. Earlier this month, the company signed a preliminary deal in Iraq for development of that country’s Majnoon oil field near the southern city of Basra. On the refining side, ExxonMobil in September opened new refining capacity in Singapore, using first-of-its-kind technology to enhance the production of high-value products such as lubricant base stocks. The new tech targets fuel oils and other “bottom-of-the-barrel” crude products for conversion to higher-value end products that will improve profitability.

Looking ahead to its Q3 results, expected on October 31, ExxonMobil is predicting high profits from both crude oil production and refining operations. The company’s crude oil profits will get an earnings boost of as much as $300 million from higher crude prices; the refined products are expected to generate between $300 million and $700 million in additional profits due to improved margins.

Looking back at the company’s 2Q25 results, we see that ExxonMobil had $85.51 billion in total revenues. This was down 12% year-over-year, but it came in just over $1 billion better than had been expected. At the bottom line, the company’s EPS of $1.64 was 8 cents per share better than the forecast.

For investors seeking an immediate return, ExxonMobil pays out a reliable dividend. The company has not missed a quarterly payment since 1995, although it will adjust the payment to keep it in accord with prevailing conditions. The last payment, declared on August 1 and paid out on September 10, was for 99 cents per share. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to $3.96 per share and gives a forward yield of 3.5%.

Sam Margolin, in his write-up of ExxonMobil for Wells Fargo, takes a bullish stance, citing several factors. He says of the stock, “We are Overweight rated on XOM. Our rating reflects: 1) XOM’s industry-leading balance sheet profile and extensive Downstream footprint provide a defensive buffer in a softer oil price environment; 2) its capital/development program offers significant flexibility, supporting sufficient headroom for competitive dividend CAGR; 3) structural cost reductions, Permian production ramp, and long-cycle LNG growth enhance optionality, positioning XOM to outperform despite commodity headwinds.”

That stated Overweight (Buy) rating comes along with a $156 price target that points toward a 39% gain for the shares on the one-year horizon.

The Moderate Buy consensus rating on ExxonMobil is based on 18 analyst reviews, which break down to 11 Buys and 7 Holds. The stock is currently trading for $112.24 and has an average target price of $126.65; together, these suggest a 13% upside over the next 12 months. (See XOM stock forecast.)

Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)

Next on our list is Valero Energy, a leader in the production and distribution of refined fuels. Valero operates a network of 15 refineries in the US, Canada, and the UK, which, taken together, employ approximately 6,000 people and have some 3.2 million barrels of daily throughput capacity. Valero’s feedstock and refined products are moved through some 3,000 miles of active pipelines, and the company has storage facilities capable of holding 130 million barrels of petroleum products.

The largest parts of Valero’s operations are centered on the Gulf Coast of the US. In this oil- and gas-rich region, the company has a dense network of refineries and terminals, mainly in Texas and in Louisiana’s Mississippi Delta. These facilities produce branded gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemical feedstocks, as well as unbranded fuels distributed across 14 states.

Valero doesn’t stop with refined fuels, however. Petroleum – crude oil – can be refined into a wide range of useful and essential products, and Valero can produce a wide array of these. Among the company’s specialty products are 45,000 barrels per day of asphalt, 28,000 barrels per day of propane, and 1.2 million tons per year of elemental sulfur. The company also produces solvents, natural gas liquids, and some 6 million tons annually of petroleum coke, an important product in the cement and steel industries.

We’ll see Valero’s 3Q25 results in a few days, on October 23, but for now we can look back at the Q2 release to get a feel for where the company stands. In the second quarter of this year, Valero generated $29.89 billion at the top line; while this was down more than 13% from 2Q24, it was also $2.73 billion ahead of the forecast. Valero’s bottom-line figure, adj. EPS of $2.28, was 51 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company reported that its Gulf Coast throughput volume reached record levels and that the company-wide refining segment throughput, at 2.9 million barrels, represented a 92% capacity utilization rate.

Like ExxonMobil above, Valero pays out a regular dividend and has a reliable payment history going back to the 1990s. The company’s last dividend was paid out September 2 at a rate of $1.13 per share; the dividend annualizes to $4.52 per share and gives a forward yield of 2.9%.

Checking in one last time with analyst Margolin and the Wells Fargo view, we find that he is impressed by Valero’s business model and its dividend return, among other attractive features. The analyst writes, “As one of the leading Independent Refiners, VLO benefits from its simple, Gulf Coast-skewed structure, low financial leverage, and a long history of dividend CAGR/shareholder returns leadership. With the market turning bullish on refining, VLO’s expected operating performance and reduced share count position the company to revisit its historical mid-cycle valuation levels.”

These comments support Margolin’s Overweight (Buy) rating on VLO shares, and his $216 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 37%.

Overall, Valero is another stock with a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, this one based on 13 recent reviews that include 9 Buys and 4 Holds. The shares are priced at $157.77, and their $177.38 average target price indicates room for an upside of 12.5% in the coming year. (See VLO stock forecast.)

XOM,ExxonMobil Expands Reach With Guyanese Crude Exports to India,,"Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM has sold four million barrels of Guyanese crude oil to two refiners in India, per Reuters.

This marks a notable expansion of Guyana’s growing presence in the global oil market. The cargoes, to be delivered at the end of 2025 or in early 2026, reflect India’s strategic move to diversify its energy sources amid geopolitical and trade pressures.

Indian Oil Corporation has purchased 2 million barrels of Golden Arrowhead (“GAH”) crude. This is Indian Oil Corporation’s, India’s largest refiner by capacity, first acquisition of the newly introduced grade. The shipment is expected to arrive between late December 2025 and early January 2026.

Meanwhile, another refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, has procured another 2 million barrels of Liza and Unity Gold crudes, also scheduled for delivery within the same timeframe. These transactions signify India’s increasing interest in South American oil as it broadens its crude basket beyond traditional suppliers.

The deal comes at a time when India faces mounting pressure from the United States to reduce its reliance on Russian oil imports. Earlier this year, the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods entering the American market, an action the Indian government strongly criticized, warning of potential risks to India’s energy security.

Guyana, emerging as a key player in the global oil industry, has seen production soar under a consortium led by ExxonMobil. Output has climbed to 770,000 barrels per day (bpd) after the commissioning of its fourth floating production facility. Per data from analytics firm Kpler, the South American nation’s crude exports reached an all-time high of 938,000 bpd in October, bolstered by the introduction of the GAH grade in July.

This latest development underscores the growing influence of U.S.-led ventures in the western hemisphere’s energy landscape. Alongside ExxonMobil, other oil giants like Chevron Corporation CVX and ConocoPhillips COP are ramping up international operations.

Chevron has been deepening its investments in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela and Guyana’s offshore blocks, while ConocoPhillips continues to expand its presence in the global LNG market and high-return shale plays. Together, these firms illustrate how U.S. energy companies are leveraging strategic partnerships and new discoveries to maintain a stronghold in the evolving global oil trade.

XOM,Halliburton Wins Key Petrobras Deals for Deepwater Solutions,,"Halliburton HAL, a global leader in oil and gas equipment and services based in Houston, TX, recently announced the awarding of multiple high-value contracts by Petrobras PBR, Brazil’s state-controlled integrated oil and gas company, to provide a range of advanced solutions for its deepwater operations.

As Halliburton continues to expand footprint in Brazil and globally, the collaboration with Petrobras highlights its ability to adapt and thrive in the complex and ever-evolving offshore energy landscape.

Beyond Halliburton and Petrobras: What Other Major Energy Companies Are Up To

There has been a lot going on in the energy world lately — not just with HAL and PBR. If you keep an eye on the market, you will see other big players making moves too. Companies like Repsol, S.A. REPYY and Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM are working on big projects that show how the industry is focusing on producing more energy output, keeping supply reliable and trying out new ideas. Here is a quick look at what these companies have been up to recently.

Repsol, a Spain-based integrated oil and gas company, recently signed a contract with Dolphin Drilling for the Borgland Dolphin rig to provide well, plug and abandonment services for at least 220 days, covering seven wells with an option for three more. The operations are scheduled to begin toward the end of 2026, with Dolphin Drilling preparing to mobilize the rig currently warm-stacked in Las Palmas. The Borgland Dolphin, built in 1977, is undergoing a mandatory safety inspection before deployment and can drill up to 27,800 feet in water depths of 1,476 feet.

Spring, TX-based integrated oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, recently signed preliminary agreements to develop Iraq’s massive Majnoon oil field, marking its return to the country after a two-year absence. The deal includes profit-sharing with Iraqi state companies and aims to boost Iraq’s oil export capacity, with potential marketing projects to enhance access to Asia’s markets. This move follows recent agreements Iraq made with other global oil majors like Chevron Corporation and BP plc, offering more favorable terms to encourage investment and increase production.

XOM,Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this oil and natural gas company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Exxon belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Exxon is expected to post earnings of $2.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $9.28 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -2.5%. This estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.02 indicates a change of +8% from what Exxon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.6%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Exxon.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Exxon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $91.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $361.02 billion and $380.72 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +5.5% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Exxon reported revenues of $83.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4%. EPS of $2.06 for the same period compares with $2.83 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.06%. The EPS surprise was -5.94%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Exxon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Exxon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

XOM,What's Going On With Exxon Mobil Stock Friday? - Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM),,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reportedly sold 4 million barrels of Guyanese crude oil to Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. in India.

As per Reuters, this is both Indian oil refiners’ first purchase of Guyanese crude oil.

In particular, Indian Oil bought 2 million barrels of Golden Arrowhead (GAH) crude, its first purchase of this grade, which is set to arrive between December and January.

Meanwhile, Hindustan Petroleum Corp bought 2 million barrels of Liza and Unity Gold crudes for delivery in the same period.

The deliveries are expected to take place in late 2025 or early 2026.

Strategic Market Expansion in Asia

The move reflects Exxon Mobil’s expansion of its customer base in Asia as production from Guyana continues to rise.

The sale underscores ExxonMobil’s role in supporting India’s efforts to diversify its crude imports while strengthening the company’s footprint in one of the world’s fastest-growing energy markets.

Notably, in August, ExxonMobil Guyana initiated production at the Yellowtail development in the offshore Stabroek block of Guyana.

ONE GUYANA, the largest FPSO on the Stabroek block, is expected to average 250,000 barrels of oil per day annually and store two million barrels of crude.

India’s Crude Import Diversification

As per the report, India’s refiners are expanding their crude mix by testing new grades from South America, where output is climbing.

The diversification effort also provides an alternative to Russian oil, as U.S. pressure on New Delhi to reduce imports from Moscow continues amid the war in Ukraine.

Global Deepwater Growth

ExxonMobil subsidiary, together with Equinor, Petrogal Brasil, and PPSA, has begun oil production at the Bacalhau field.

This marks ExxonMobil’s first upstream output in Brazil and a significant milestone in its global deepwater growth strategy.

The company is set to release third-quarter results on October 31. Investors can gain exposure to XOM via Global X Funds Global X PureCap MSCI Energy ETF (NYSE: GXPE) and Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE).

Price Action: XOM shares were trading lower by 0.44% to $110.15 premarket at last check Friday.

XOM,Stocks Retreat on Chipmaker Weakness and Renewed China Tensions,,"The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed down -0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.71%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -0.99%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -0.52%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -0.96%.

Stock indexes settled lower on Wednesday as the broader market was under pressure throughout the session, with chipmakers selling off after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that fell below expectations. Also, Netflix closed down more than -9% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS. Other corporate earnings results on Wednesday were supportive for stocks.

Stock losses accelerated Wednesday afternoon after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering broad restrictions on exports to China made with US software in retaliation for China’s latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.84%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.4 bp to 3.949%. T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled slightly higher. Wednesday’s slump in stocks, sparked by renewed China trade tensions, triggered short covering in T-notes and pushed prices higher. T-notes maintained modest gain on Wednesday due to strong demand for the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields were mixed on Wednesday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +1.1 bp to 2.563%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and finished down -6.0 bp to 4.417%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, “The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive,” and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Note: CRSH , DIPS , FIAT , WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.”

Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant.

Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s).

1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.

2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October21,2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income , remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.

3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income , earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period endingSeptember 30, 2025 ,expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.

4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs ) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs.

THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET.

Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs)

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.

Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not.

Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index.

Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments.

Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods.

Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.

Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.

Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.

Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.

High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses.

Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.

Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.

New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.

Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period.

Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline.

Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way.

Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO)

Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY)

Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad.

Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.

Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight.

Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY)

Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities.

Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies.

The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT)

YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT.

Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends.

Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.

Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs)

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.

Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective.

Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses.

Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods.

Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy.

Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.

Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.

Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.

Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.

High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings.

Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.

Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.

New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.

Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period.

Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ)

Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization.

Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential.

Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

XOM,"Nvidia will someday be a distant memory -- and that's a good thing, say Nobel laureates",,"Research conducted by the recent Nobel laureates in economics suggests that Nvidia will not remain the largest publicly traded corporation for long.

None of the Nobel Prize winners —Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University, Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France and INSEAD in Paris, and Peter Howitt of Brown University — focused their research on Nvidia NVDA specifically. But much of their work has looked at the crucial role played by “creative destruction” in promoting long-term economic growth — and it is that which will inevitably cause Nvidia to someday be little more than a distant memory to stock-market historians.

Meme stock Beyond Meat blows nearly 50% of recent gains in wild day of trading

‘Big Brother is watching how we spend our dollars’: I asked to withdraw money from my bank. The teller started grilling me. Is this normal?

‘We have been married for 10 years’: My children will get my estate — not my husband, who has $1.3 million. Is that fair?

“Creative destruction” refers to what happens “when a new and better product enters the market, [which causes] the companies selling the older products [to] lose out,” to quote from the Nobel Prize committee’s press release. “The innovation represents something new and is thus creative. However, it is also destructive, as the company whose technology becomes passé is outcompeted.”

Many investors in the losing corporations find this a hard pill to swallow. But a quick walk down memory lane is all that’s needed to remind us that, on average, investors are better off because of creative destruction. In the first half of the 19th century, the largest U.S. corporation was the Vermont Central Railroad, but you would be hard pressed to find one investor in a thousand who today has even heard of that company.

But you don’t have to go back 200 years to appreciate how much better your portfolio has performed because of creative destruction. Consider a hypothetical portfolio that, each year beginning in 1981, invested in the company that had the largest market cap as of the end of the previous year. If creative destruction were not the powerful force it is, this portfolio would have been an outstanding performer. But it hasn’t, as you can see from the accompanying chart. One hundred dollars invested in this portfolio at the beginning of 1981 would today be worth $2,640 — versus $11,729 if that $100 had instead been invested in the S&P 500 SPX.

Over the last five decades this portfolio has owned a series of Nvidias. In the 1980s, IBM IBM was at the top of the market-cap rankings, for example; in the 1990s, it was General Electric GE. Exxon Mobil XOM held that ranking in the aughts but, beginning about 10 years ago, Apple AAPL rose to the top. Now it’s Nvidia’s turn.

‘Dark clouds’

The Nobel prize winners’ research also sheds light on some of the politics involved in creative destruction, to which investors need to pay attention. On the one hand, since no one likes to be on the receiving end of the “destruction” half of creative destruction, the largest corporations and their shareholders will inevitably exert enormous pressure on our politicians for protection. On the other hand, however, as Aghion put it in his remarks after receiving his prize, “anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstruction to growth.”

Investors more often than not fail to appreciate Aghion’s insight, since the diminution in future economic growth that results from protectionism only manifests itself over the longer term. To the extent investors care only about short-term returns, they therefore think that protecting the largest corporations is a free lunch.

But it isn’t free, either for our retirement standard of living or for our children’s and grandchildren’s. Right now the Nobel laureates are concerned about a “protectionist wave in the U.S.”

A looming trade war is only one aspect of this protectionist wave. Another is the growing willingness of the federal government to acquire ownership stakes in various corporations, which will at least partially protect those companies from competition-wrought destruction. Recent examples include Intel INTC, in which the government recently acquired a 10% stake; MP Materials MP (15% stake); Lithium Americas LAC (10% stake); Trilogy Metals TMQ (10% stake); and U.S. Steel, which earlier this year was acquired by Nippon Steel but in which the government owns a so-called “golden share.”

For these and other reasons, Aghion senses “dark clouds” on the horizon, saying the protectionist wave in the U.S. is “not good for world growth and innovation.”

XOM,"Energy Outlook: Volatility, Tech Shifts, And Smart Investments - Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)",,"Market Uncertainty Redefines Energy Strategies

This year has put the energy sector in a not so stable territory, with crude oil prices seesawing due to a potent mix of trade disputes, supply chain upheavals, and geopolitical unrest. From the Gulf of Mexico to the Middle East, traditional market cycles have given way to a profound restructuring of energy security and independence. Investors now face a landscape where stability hinges on adapting to these disruptive forces rather than relying on past patterns.

Geopolitical Triggers Fuel Price Swings

The driving forces behind this volatility include escalating U.S.-China trade frictions, marked by new energy tariffs, and Europe's carbon border measures, which are reshaping global energy flows. Ongoing instability in regions like Iran, Venezuela, and parts of Africa adds a layer of risk to every oil barrel, pushing prices into unpredictable territory and demanding sharper risk assessment from market players.

U.S. Shale Adapts to a Stabilizing Role

U.S. shale, once a game-changer, now serves as a steadying influence amid supply challenges. Its growth momentum has slowed due to high interest rates, escalating service costs, and maturing fields, especially in the Permian Basin. Producers are shifting toward financial prudence over expansion, making shale a reactive player. Looking to 2026, it will support market balance rather than drive aggressive output.

OPEC+ Balances Control Amid Growing Challenges

OPEC+ continues to wield influence by fine-tuning production targets with precision, aiming to assert dominance rather than oversupply. However, internal discord and competition from non-OPEC sources, including a projected 1.3 million barrels per day increase in 2025 per IEA data, test its authority. The cartel's modest November 2025 quota hike of 137,000 barrels per day signals caution, with idle reserves of 3-6 million barrels per day adding psychological pressure on prices.

LNG Markets Shift with Geopolitical Weight

Natural gas dynamics are also evolving geographically. Europe's demand rises with colder winters, while Asia leans on domestic coal amid weaker industrial activity due to trade tensions. North American producers seize this shift, expanding LNG exports from British Columbia to the Gulf Coast, with long-term deals to Europe doubling as geopolitical leverage alongside commercial gains.

Tech Innovations Reshape Energy Operations

Parallel to these shifts, technology is transforming the industry. Oil companies cut exploration costs with A.I.-powered reservoir modeling, while solar gains ground with cheaper production and higher efficiency. Carbon capture paired with enhanced oil recovery and hydrogen experiments in transport and power generation signal progress, though scalability lags. Electric pumps in fracking and upgraded gas turbines boost output, bridging fossil fuel reliance, while electrification reshapes refined product demand.

Investment Landscape: Stability vs. Opportunity

Energy stocks trail commodity prices, reflecting ESG pressures, regulatory shifts, and renewable competition. Yet, opportunities persist for those with rigorous research. Large-cap firms like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), with strong balance sheets and transition investments (e.g., Guyana deepwater, Permian dominance), offer resilience. Mid-caps like Cheniere Energy thrive in M&A and LNG, while juniors with niche assets (e.g., Antero Midstream (NYSE: AM) ) face survival challenges without partnerships.

M&A and Portfolio Strategies for Resilience

North American M&A is set to rise, focusing on LNG, carbon capture, and low-carbon chemicals for efficiency and transition alignment. Despite renewable growth, oil and gas remain vital for aviation and heavy transport, favoring producers with low-cost reserves and geopolitical safeguards.

Q4 2025: A Crossroads for Energy Decisions

As Q4 unfolds, OPEC+ tactics, U.S. shale restraint, and LNG's geopolitical role, alongside Middle East tensions and carbon regulations, signal a year of strategic realignment.

XOM,"Wall Street's Week Ahead: Megacap-led earnings deluge, Fed meeting headline busy U.S. markets week",,"The U.S. stock rally confronts a potentially consequential week to keep its momentum heading into year-end, including a flood of corporate results headlined by megacap companies and a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting.

U.S.-China trade tensions could come to a head in the coming days, while a persistent U.S. government shutdown further unsettles the backdrop for investors.

Stocks have weathered increased volatility this month, with the S&P 500 posting an all-time closing high on Friday, after a 36% climb since its low for the year in April. The benchmark index is up over 15% year-to-date.

Given that the market has rallied for several months without a particularly significant decline, equities could remain choppy in the days ahead, said Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.

“What we need to see is continued earnings beats and corporate America talking positively about the economy,” Fasciano said. “When people start to get nervous, it’s when they see consumer confidence coming down, or business confidence coming down.”

Third-quarter earnings season is off to a solid start overall, despite disappointments this week from companies such as streamer Netflix and chipmaker Texas Instruments .

Including results from 143 companies that have reported, S&P 500 profits are estimated to have increased 10.4% from a year ago, according to LSEG IBES data as of Friday. So far, 87% of companies have topped analysts’ earnings estimates and 82% have beaten revenue estimates - both higher than historically typical rates.

Next week is the busiest of the season, with over 170 companies expected to report. They include Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms, five of the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of companies with huge market capitalizations whose shares dominate equity indexes and which overall have posted outsized profit growth over the past couple of years.

Their profit edge over the rest of the index is narrowing, but the Magnificent Seven are still expected to post stronger results this period. Earnings for the group are expected to rise 16.6% against an 8.1% rise for the rest of the index, according to data this week from Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been a main driver of stock market performance.

“The factor that is probably going to have the most influence between now and the end of the year is going to be these big tech (reports),” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “The hurdle rate is very high for these companies coming into next week’s earnings.”

Other companies due to report results next week include drugmaker Eli Lilly, oil majors Exxon and Chevron and payment firms Visa and Mastercard .

The Fed is widely expected to lower its current benchmark rate of 4%-4.25% by another quarter percentage point when it decides on policy on Wednesday, a view supported by tamer-than-estimated inflation data on Friday. With that rate move already factored into asset prices, markets are likely to be more sensitive to any forward-looking language from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the central bank expected to cut rates further at its next meeting in December.

“The biggest impact would be if the Fed gave any signs that they will deviate from their rate-cutting path,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist for Morningstar Wealth.

Possibly clouding the Fed’s decision-making ability is the lack of data provided by the government since its shutdown began on October 1, including delays in employment releases at a time of simmering worries about the health of the labor market.

An increasingly extended shutdown - which has already lasted longer than the average length of past shutdowns - also likely poses more risk to economic growth, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

“The longer it drags on, the more the market will not be able to ignore it,” Hogan said.

Investors also largely had shrugged aside trade-related risks in recent months, but renewed U.S.-China rifts have brought tensions between the world’s two largest economies back to the fore.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month threatened significantly higher tariffs on China to take effect November 1, after Beijing imposed export controls on rare earths. Investors will be watching developments around an anticipated meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming week to see if the nations can calm tensions between them.

“If tariffs rise to the levels that President Trump is threatening on China ... you would see a more volatile and probably a more negative reaction in the market, especially if (investors) anticipate that that’s going to be lasting,” Saglimbene said.",The Globe and Mail,2025-10-24T10:16:18Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-wall-streets-week-ahead-megacap-led-earnings-deluge-fed-meeting/,0.6,2025-10-25 13:51:44.457576,,0.1686274509803922

Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968.

For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below:

Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the ""Short ETFs.""

Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant.

Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s).

1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.

2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 21, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF's Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF's most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF's NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.

3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending September 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF's share price at the end of the 30-Day period.

4 Each ETF's strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset's shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset's shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF's strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.

5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount.

Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs.

THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET.

Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs)

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.

Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not.

Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index.

Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments.

Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund's call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund's returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods.

Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.

Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund's investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.

Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.

Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund's investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.

High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund's holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund's expenses.

Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.

Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ""non-diversified,"" it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.

New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.

Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period.

Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund's assets and distributions, if any, may decline.

Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way.

Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO)

Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current ""spot"" or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY)

Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad.

Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs""). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.

Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight.

Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY)

Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®'s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities.

Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®'s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies.

The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT)

YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current ""spot"" or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT.

Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund's indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends.

Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.

Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs)

Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.

Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective.

Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund's synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund's indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses.

Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund's put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund's returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods.

Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund's strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund's potential losses from the Fund's short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund's losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund's value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund's investment strategy.

Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members.

Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund's investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund's other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions.

Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events.

Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund's investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next.

High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund's holdings.

Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil.

Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ""non-diversified,"" it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund.

New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions.

Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period.

Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole.

Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund's assets and distributions, if any, may decline.

Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ)

Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization.

Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund's synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund's indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential.

Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund's NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund's ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options' expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund's NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund's NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract's expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund's NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund's options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund's NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund's NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

According to a study by Hartford Funds in conjunction with Ned Davis Research, over the past five decades, dividend growers tend to outperform non-dividend growers while experiencing less volatility along the way. If you're interested in dividend stocks, here are seven solid investments you can buy and hold for the next 20 years and beyond.

1. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO) appeal stems from its unmatched global brand portfolio, vast distribution network, and high-margin beverage concentrate model. Operating in over 200 countries, Coca-Cola collects steady cash flows while bottlers shoulder most capital costs. Its consistent pricing power and scale buffer against inflation and currency swings.

Coca-Cola has raised its dividend payment every year for 63 consecutive years, with annual increases reflecting steady free-cash-flow generation and disciplined capital management. Its strategic expansion into low-sugar drinks, coffees, and energy beverages broadens growth beyond soda while maintaining brand dominance.

2. Procter & Gamble

Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) may be the gold standard of dividend dependability. The company has made more than 135 years of uninterrupted payments and has grown its dividend payment for 69 consecutive years -- one of the longest streaks among today's Dividend Kings.

Procter & Gamble's strength comes from its portfolio of trusted consumer brands, which includes Tide, Pampers, Gillette, and Crest. These strong brands deliver consistent, recession-resistant cash flow. With its scale and global reach, brand pricing power enables steady margins even amid inflation. The company converts over 90% of earnings to free cash flow, funding dividends and buybacks without straining its balance sheet.

3. Enterprise Products Partners

Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is a master limited partnership operating a highly stable fee-based energy infrastructure network in North America. It operates over 50,000 miles of pipelines and over 300 million barrels of liquid storage, along with processing assets that span crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs).

As a midstream operator, Enterprise is more insulated from commodity-price swings. That's because most of its revenue comes from fee-based contracts tied to the volume of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids moved through its pipelines, not their market price. Approximately 90% of its contracts include an escalation provision to mitigate the impact of inflation on cash flow and distributions.

Enterprise Products Partners has grown its distribution for 26 consecutive years. Given its stable, fee-based model and growth in domestic oil and gas production, along with its 7% yield, Enterprise is a solid dividend stock for investors.

4. ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) operates as an integrated oil and gas company. In other words, it engages in activities across the entire value chain, including exploring and producing crude oil and natural gas (upstream operations) and refining crude oil into fuel, lubricants, and other petroleum-based products (downstream operations).

Operating across the value chain enables ExxonMobil to weather volatile oil prices and deliver for investors. This diverse business model is a big reason why the company has grown its dividend payout to investors for 42 consecutive years.

Exxon's expansion in liquefied natural gas (LNG), Guyana oil production, and low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen add future cash-flow resiliency.

5. Realty Income

Realty Income (NYSE: O), also known as ""The Monthly Dividend Company,"" is a diversified real estate investment trust (REIT) with a diversified portfolio of more than 15,000 properties leased to blue chip tenants like Walgreens, Dollar General, and FedEx on long-term, triple-net leases (NNN).

By utilizing triple net leases, it shifts most expenses, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance, to tenants to ensure a more predictable cash flow. This has enabled the company to raise its dividend payment every year since 1994.

With consistent occupancy rates near 99% and disciplined capital management, Realty Income offers investors a combination of dependable monthly income and steady long-term growth.

6. Aflac

Aflac (NYSE: AFL) offers life insurance and supplemental insurance, providing its customers with coverage that traditional health insurers typically do not cover. Its strength as a steady dividend payer comes from its conservative underwriting and a strong market position in both the U.S. and Japan.

The company has a strong brand and a long history of profitability, fueling its dividend, which it has grown consistently for over 42 years. The company's focus on high-return insurance lines and disciplined cost control provides it with resilience through economic cycles.

7. Chubb

Chubb (NYSE: CB) provides an array of insurance policies, including commercial and consumer property and casualty (P&C), personal accident, supplemental health, life insurance, and reinsurance. The company is a major player in the industry, with operations spanning 54 countries.

Chubb's strength lies in underwriting discipline. With policies spanning a wide array of risk types, it's vital that Chubb accurately assesses its risks and prices its policies accordingly. Its combined ratio, a key measure of profitability in the insurance industry, consistently beats the industry average, showing strong risk selection and cost control.

With more than three decades of uninterrupted dividend increases and a payout ratio of 33%, Chubb's dividend is both sustainable and positioned for continued growth.

XOM,Why This Texas-Based Company's Stock Could Reward Long-Term Investors,,"Key Points

Exxon is one of the best companies in the global oil industry.

The energy company has a plan to deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next several years.

It should have plenty of fuel to continue returning cash to investors.

10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil ›

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the undisputed leader of the global oil industry. Last quarter, its $7.1 billion of earnings and $11.5 billion of cash flow from operations led all international oil companies (IOCs). Exxon also has an industry-leading balance sheet, returned more cash to shareholders than anyone in the oil patch last quarter, and has delivered peer-leading total shareholder returns over the past five years.

The Texas-based oil giant -- Exxon's global headquarters is just north of Houston -- is in a strong position to continue rewarding its shareholders in the coming years. Here's a look at what fuels that optimistic view.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Exxon's bold plan to 2030

ExxonMobil operates under multi-year plans. Late last year, the global oil giant unveiled its plan to 2030. The company's long-term investment strategy aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in annual earnings and $30 billion in incremental cash flow by 2030. This outlook implies the company will deliver 10% compound annual earnings growth and 8% compound annual cash flow growth over the next five years. Those are solid growth rates for such a large company, especially in the volatile energy sector.

The energy company isn't banking on higher oil prices to fuel its earnings growth plan. Exxon can achieve its earnings growth target at an average Brent oil price (the global oil market benchmark) of $65 a barrel in 2030. While that's higher than the current price near $60 a barrel, Brent was over $70 a barrel at the time Exxon published its long-term outlook, and was just at its 2030 target price point a few weeks ago.

Instead, the main fuel source is Exxon's plans to invest $140 billion into high-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Notable focus areas include expanding its world-class operations in Guyana, continuing to build out its global liquefied natural gas (LNG) capabilities, and growing its leading products solutions business by developing new petrochemical and refining projects worldwide. It's also investing in several low-carbon energy businesses, including plans to build a leading lithium business in the coming years. Exxon expects to earn returns in excess of 30% over the life of these investments.

Additionally, Exxon plans to continue executing its industry-leading structural cost savings initiative. Since 2019, Exxon has delivered $13.5 billion in structural cost savings, surpassing the total of all other IOCs combined. The company expects to achieve $18 billion in cumulative structural cost savings by 2030, further boosting its bottom line.

Returning its growing cash flow gusher to shareholders

Exxon estimates that its strategic plan can generate $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash through the end of 2030 after funding its massive capital investment target. The company has the flexibility to return most, if not all, this money to shareholders.

Exxon currently has the top balance sheet in the oil patch. The company finished the second quarter with an industry-leading net debt-to-capital ratio of 8%, bolstered by a cash balance of $15.7 billion. This provides the company with tremendous financial flexibility to continue investing in its business and returning cash to shareholders, even during periods of lower oil prices.

As a result, it will undoubtedly continue increasing its dividend, something it has done for 42 straight years. That leads the oil sector. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of consecutive annual dividend increases. This growth will add to Exxon's already attractive dividend, which currently yields 3.5%, nearly triple the S&P 500's level of less than 1.2%.

Additionally, Exxon will also continue to repurchase a meaningful amount of its shares each year. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion of its stock this year and a similar amount in 2026, assuming favorable market conditions. It could buy back even more shares in 2027 and beyond, especially if oil prices improve.

A potentially very enriching plan

Exxon has delivered leading total shareholder returns over the past five years by expanding its global energy business and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Looking forward, the company's clear commitment to delivering healthy earnings growth and robust capital returns puts it in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. This high return potential makes Exxon a compelling long-term investment.

XOM,Why This Texas-Based Company's Stock Could Reward Long-Term Investors | The Motley Fool,,"ExxonMobil (XOM 0.51%) is the undisputed leader of the global oil industry. Last quarter, its $7.1 billion of earnings and $11.5 billion of cash flow from operations led all international oil companies (IOCs). Exxon also has an industry-leading balance sheet, returned more cash to shareholders than anyone in the oil patch last quarter, and has delivered peer-leading total shareholder returns over the past five years.

The Texas-based oil giant -- Exxon's global headquarters is just north of Houston -- is in a strong position to continue rewarding its shareholders in the coming years. Here's a look at what fuels that optimistic view.

Exxon's bold plan to 2030

ExxonMobil operates under multi-year plans. Late last year, the global oil giant unveiled its plan to 2030. The company's long-term investment strategy aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in annual earnings and $30 billion in incremental cash flow by 2030. This outlook implies the company will deliver 10% compound annual earnings growth and 8% compound annual cash flow growth over the next five years. Those are solid growth rates for such a large company, especially in the volatile energy sector.

The energy company isn't banking on higher oil prices to fuel its earnings growth plan. Exxon can achieve its earnings growth target at an average Brent oil price (the global oil market benchmark) of $65 a barrel in 2030. While that's higher than the current price near $60 a barrel, Brent was over $70 a barrel at the time Exxon published its long-term outlook, and was just at its 2030 target price point a few weeks ago.

Instead, the main fuel source is Exxon's plans to invest $140 billion into high-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Notable focus areas include expanding its world-class operations in Guyana, continuing to build out its global liquefied natural gas (LNG) capabilities, and growing its leading products solutions business by developing new petrochemical and refining projects worldwide. It's also investing in several low-carbon energy businesses, including plans to build a leading lithium business in the coming years. Exxon expects to earn returns in excess of 30% over the life of these investments.

Additionally, Exxon plans to continue executing its industry-leading structural cost savings initiative. Since 2019, Exxon has delivered $13.5 billion in structural cost savings, surpassing the total of all other IOCs combined. The company expects to achieve $18 billion in cumulative structural cost savings by 2030, further boosting its bottom line.

Returning its growing cash flow gusher to shareholders

Exxon estimates that its strategic plan can generate $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash through the end of 2030 after funding its massive capital investment target. The company has the flexibility to return most, if not all, this money to shareholders.

Exxon currently has the top balance sheet in the oil patch. The company finished the second quarter with an industry-leading net debt-to-capital ratio of 8%, bolstered by a cash balance of $15.7 billion. This provides the company with tremendous financial flexibility to continue investing in its business and returning cash to shareholders, even during periods of lower oil prices.

As a result, it will undoubtedly continue increasing its dividend, something it has done for 42 straight years. That leads the oil sector. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of consecutive annual dividend increases. This growth will add to Exxon's already attractive dividend, which currently yields 3.5%, nearly triple the S&P 500's level of less than 1.2%.

Additionally, Exxon will also continue to repurchase a meaningful amount of its shares each year. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion of its stock this year and a similar amount in 2026, assuming favorable market conditions. It could buy back even more shares in 2027 and beyond, especially if oil prices improve.

A potentially very enriching plan

Exxon has delivered leading total shareholder returns over the past five years by expanding its global energy business and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Looking forward, the company's clear commitment to delivering healthy earnings growth and robust capital returns puts it in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. This high return potential makes Exxon a compelling long-term investment.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-23T08:38:23Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/23/why-this-texas-based-companys-stock-could-reward-l/,0.5,2025-10-25 13:52:06.790484,,0.2392156862745098

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

Chevron produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, lubricants, petrochemicals, and renewable fuels across global markets.

The company operates an integrated business model, generating revenue through upstream exploration and production as well as downstream refining, chemical manufacturing, and energy marketing.

Chevron serves a diverse customer base, including industrial, commercial, and retail clients worldwide.

Chevron Corporation is one of the world’s largest integrated energy companies, with a diversified portfolio spanning upstream and downstream operations.

Foolish take

I wouldn’t look at Fourpath Capital Management’s sale of Chevron as a sign the fund is pessimistic about the Energy Sector. The fund only reduced its stake in the integreated oil company by about half.

Fourpath Capital Management made 18 new additions in the third quarter and Haliburton was one of the stocks it added. The fund completely exited two dozen positions during the third quarter, none of which were oil related.

Chevron completed its acquisition of Hess Corporation in July. When the company reports third quarter results on Oct. 31, 2025, investors will be looking for signs the increased capacity will improve profit margins.

Income seeking investors appreciate Chevron for steadily growing dividend. Over the past five years the company’s raised its quarterly payout by 32.6%. and it’s well positioned to continue its streak. It’s assets produce oil at a lower cost than any of its competitors, according to Wood Mackenzie.

XOM,HCMC drops major residential plan to turn Nha Rong Wharf into cultural landmark - VnExpress International,,"Party Secretary Tran Luu Quang announced this decision at a conference last weekend, saying the city had allocated land for the housing project in what is now Xom Chieu Ward, but that the Standing Committee of the Party Committee pulled the plug on it.

He said the cultural space would be expanded along the wharf, and the part of the land remaining would be transformed into a park, used to widen Nguyen Tat Thanh Street and develop public services but not used for residential development.

""The economic value of the project is huge but it involves legal issues and legacy projects so it needs time to resolve,"" Quang said.

Nha Rong Wharf and Khanh Hoi Port are on Nguyen Tat Thanh Street.

The wharf is now officially named the Ho Chi Minh Museum.

On June 5, 1911, Nguyen Tat Thanh (later known as President Ho Chi Minh) boarded the ship Amiral Latouche-Tréville from here to go to Europe to seek national independence.

Thirty years later he returned with a path that laid the foundation for Vietnam.

Nha Rong is a few hundred meters from Nguyen Hue pedestrian square and Bach Dang Wharf.

Also at the conference, Quang announced that a 37,000 sq.m site at 1 Ly Thai To Street at the junction of Ly Thai To, Hung Vuong and Tran Binh Trong streets opposite the Cong Hoa six-road junction, would also be converted into a park.

The city also plans to build a memorial there for citizens who died of Covid-19. This plot of land houses seven villas that have remain unused for many years.

The city has commissioned architects to design a multifunctional park, a public place for cultural and recreational activities with electricity, water to toilets, to increase the availability of public spaces and ease traffic.","VnExpress International – Latest news, business, travel and analysis from Vietnam",2025-10-20T08:26:37Z,https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/traffic/hcmc-drops-major-residential-plan-to-turn-nha-rong-wharf-into-cultural-landmark-4953557.html,0.4,2025-10-25 13:52:59.358309,,0.2549019607843137

XOM,Nvidia Stock at 8% of the S&P 500 Index Is a Big Problem for Investors. Let's Do the Math.,,"Some More Math to Demonstrate the Point

NVDA was off 4.4% during the daily trading session on Tuesday, Oct. 14. It is about 8% of the S&P 500 index. Multiply those together, and that means NVDA alone had a negative impact of 0.36% on the S&P 500 that day alone. The whole index was down 0.12%. In other words an S&P 500 without NVDA would have actually been up 0.24%.

Yes, this is just fleeting math calculations. But the point remains: a single stock that makes up 8% of the most followed index in stock market history is a red flag.

It is about more than numbers. It also relates to the potential for investors to make decisions without adequate information. Yes, the information exists, and it is easy to find. But it may not be obvious.

JNJ,North Carolina Wants to 'Lead the Nation' in Psychedelics. Here's 1 'Strong Buy' Stock to Buy Now.,,"Depression remains one of the world’s most debilitating conditions, impacting millions worldwide with symptoms that can disrupt every facet of life — from work and relationships to basic daily functioning. For many, traditional antidepressants offer little relief, especially those facing treatment-resistant depression (TRD), where symptoms persist despite multiple therapies.

This growing unmet need is fueling a new frontier in mental health: Psychedelic medicine. Biotech firms are now exploring psychedelic compounds and therapeutics to rewire the brain and restore balance where conventional drugs have failed.

Amid this shift, North Carolina is emerging as an unexpected leader. After a key meeting organized by Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS), the North Carolina Psychedelic Policy Coalition, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy, North Carolina Senator Bob Brinson said the state could “lead the nation” in expanding access to psychedelic therapies.

The news sparked a rally in the market, with Atai Life Sciences (ATAI) — a biotech focused on psychedelic-based therapies — seeing double-digit gains. With a strong pipeline, rising bipartisan support, and Wall Street’s bullish outlook, ATAI stock looks like a smart portfolio pick for those eyeing the next wave of mental health innovation.

About Atai Life Sciences Stock

Based in both Berlin, Germany and the Netherlands, Atai Life Sciences is pushing the boundaries of mental health treatment. This clinical-stage biotech focuses on next-gen therapies using psychedelic compounds and digital therapeutics to tackle depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. With a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, Atai is now expanding its footprint, aiming to acquire Beckley Psytech to create a powerhouse blending expertise in psychedelics, CNS drug development, and rapid-acting therapies.

Atai’s pipeline is designed to transform mental health care. Key assets include VLS-01 (DMT-based for treatment-resistant depression), EMP-01 (MDMA-based for social anxiety), and novel non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists. With convenient administration methods and short in-clinic times, Atai is positioning itself as a market leader in next-gen psychedelic medicine.

Atai Life Sciences’ performance reflects strong investor confidence and significant market enthusiasm that’s hard to ignore. Fueled by an ambitious pipeline of psychedelic-based therapies, ATAI shares have skyrocketed 411% over the past 52 weeks. Even in 2025, the stock has surged 338%, with a remarkable 281% climb over the past six months alone.

ATAI stock has hit key milestones along the way. Recently, shares touched an all-time high of $6.75 on Oct. 20, before a minor pullback, signaling healthy profit-taking amid a buying frenzy. Trading volumes highlight the intensity of the rally. Some 31 million shares exchanged hands on Oct. 17 and over 10 million shares traded on Oct. 20, showing that the stock remains a hot ticket among investors, although its technicals do hint at caution.

Atai Life Sciences’ Q2 Earnings Snapshot

Atai Life Sciences entered the second quarter of 2025 with a mix of progress and pressure — a story familiar to anyone who’s followed the long, unpredictable path of biotech innovation. On Aug. 14, the company posted its Q2 earnings report, and while the results weren’t perfect, they painted a picture of a company tightening its belt and sharpening its strategy.

Revenue came in at $719,000, a 163% year-over-year (YOY) jump, landing roughly in line with expectations. Net loss per share narrowed to $0.14, a big improvement from last year’s figure, though still a bit wider than Wall Street had hoped. It’s a sign that the company is learning to move leaner, cutting excess weight but still sprinting toward profitability.

R&D spend fell to $11.1 million from $12.6 million in last year’s quarter, reflecting lower personnel and consulting costs, even as contract research spending rose. Meanwhile, general and administrative expenses ticked up to $14.9 million, mainly tied to its planned strategic combination with Beckley Psytech — a deal that could redefine Atai’s footprint in psychedelic-based mental health.

Cash reserves told a steadier story. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term securities came in at $95.9 million as of June 30, 2025, up from $72.3 million at the end of 2024, thanks to equity issuances and asset sales. And with another $50 million in committed funding announced in July, Atai expects to stay well-capitalized into the second half of 2027. That's a luxury few early-stage biotechs can claim.

The company also delivered a major milestone: Positive topline Phase 2b results for BPL-003, its fast-acting treatment for TRD. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meeting request is already on deck for later this year — a critical step toward commercialization.

So yes, the losses are still there, but the direction matters. Analysts see fiscal 2025 losses narrowing 44% YOY to $0.52 per share, remaining steady in the next fiscal year. Profitability remains a longer climb. Atai’s roadmap — from the Beckley merger to its deep R&D bench — signals a company preparing not just to survive, but to lead the mental health renaissance that’s finally catching global momentum.

Atai’s Moment to Lead

North Carolina is quietly turning into the next frontier for psychedelic medicine, and the push is being led by those who have seen the worst of war. With a large veteran population battling depression, PTSD, and anxiety, the state is now opening its doors to alternative therapies.

At a recent bipartisan event, Senator Bob Brinson and Representative Eric Ager spoke passionately about veterans who found healing through plant-based treatments, setting the tone for a serious policy shift. Their efforts are already reflected in a bipartisan bill proposing a Psychedelic Medicine Task Force, alongside a $5 million research grant program to study psilocybin and MDMA’s therapeutic potential.

For Atai Life Sciences, this is where science meets opportunity. As regulations loosen, Atai could step in with its deep R&D capabilities, partnering with universities and state agencies to accelerate trials, validate data, and bring next-gen mental health solutions to market. In a state hungry for hope and armed with funding, Atai might just find its perfect proving ground.

What Do Analysts Expect for Atai Life Sciences Stock?

This week, Needham initiated coverage on ATAI stock with a “Buy” rating and a $12 price target, seeing major upside in its psychedelic pipeline. The firm believes Atai’s lead candidate, BPL-003, could outshine Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Spravato with better efficacy and easier administration.

By leveraging Spravato’s existing infrastructure, Needham projects that BPL-003 could capture 20% of the market and exceed $2.5 billion in sales by 2035. The brokerage firm believes Atai is well-positioned to unlock real value in this fast-evolving mental health frontier.

ATAI stock has a “Strong Buy” rating overall, reflecting solid confidence from the analyst community. Among the 10 analysts tracking the stock, eight issue a “Strong Buy,” one backs a “Moderate Buy,” and one advises a “Hold.”

While the average analyst price target of $12.14 suggests the biopharma stock has upside potential of 111%, the Street-high target of $16 hints that ATAI could rally as much as 178% from current levels.",Barchart.com,2025-10-24T17:35:17Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35665159/north-carolina-wants-to-lead-the-nation-in-psychedelics-heres-1-strong-buy-stock-to-buy-now,1.0,2025-10-25 13:54:04.337254,,0.09019607843137245
JNJ,Trade Truce Hope: How US-China Talks Could Boost Healthcare ETFs,,"The White House announced yesterday that U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Oct. 30 at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea. This high-stakes meeting has renewed hopes about a possible de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economic powerhouses.

A positive outcome — particularly a tariff reduction or a long-term trade rapprochement — from next week’s meeting could provide a significant boost to Healthcare Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).

The healthcare sector, which relies heavily on global supply chains, has been facing increasing pressure from tariffs that have raised input costs for everything from medical devices to pharmaceuticals. Prominent healthcare ETFs like Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH), and Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT), which hold large U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, stand to benefit most from reduced trade uncertainty.

But before analyzing these ETFs individually, let us delve deeper into why the U.S.-China trade talks hold such immense importance for these ETFs’ growth prospects, considering these funds’ huge stakes in U.S. healthcare companies.

US Healthcare’s Reliance on China

America’s healthcare system is significantly intertwined with Chinese manufacturing, making it highly vulnerable to trade disruptions. While the United States is a major global producer, the nation’s dependence on China for key components, especially Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and medical devices, is substantial.

Data from recent years highlights this reliance. For instance, as per the American Hospital Association’s May 2025 report, America gets nearly 30% of its APIs from China, whereas, as per a 2023 Department of Health and Human Services estimate, over 90% of generic sterile injectable drugs — including many chemotherapy treatments and antibiotics — depend on APIs from either India or China.

And not just API, other vital medical consumables, ranging from gloves to syringes, have been making their way from China to America over the past decade, making the U.S. healthcare sector immensely dependent on its Chinese counterpart. Evidently, as per an October 2025 report by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (“CPA”), a U.S. organization representing exclusively domestic producers across various sectors and industries, nearly 99% of medical gloves used in the United States are imported, and the upstream nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) feedstock used to make nitrile gloves is dominated by China. The same report also stated that China accounted for approximately 60% of total U.S. syringe import volume in 2024.

On the other hand, as per the International Trade Administration’s September 2025 report, China surpassed Canada and the Netherlands, becoming the United States’ largest export destination of pharmaceutical products. So, not only does America import a large share of its medical supplies and APIs from China, but the U.S. healthcare sector is also dependent on Beijing for market access when it comes to selling its products internationally.

As a result of this dependence, large-cap pharmaceutical and medical device stocks such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which have complex global supply chains that use Chinese-sourced materials, expressed concern about facing the brunt of the U.S. import tariffs on Chinese products.

For instance, in April 2025, JNJ announced its expectation of $400 million tariff-related costs to impact its 2025 results following the tariff imposition by the U.S. government. Similarly, in April, GE HealthCare (GEHC) announced that it expects a total tariff impact of about $500 million for the year, primarily driven by U.S.-China bilateral tariffs, which will account for almost $375 million of this impact.

Against this backdrop, the current situation of a possible great truce between the two nations should be highly beneficial for Healthcare ETFs, as any tariff reduction would immediately reduce supply-chain costs and eliminate the lingering uncertainty that dampens the sector’s growth.

JNJ,Merck's Non-Oncology Drugs Q3 Performance: What to Expect,,"Merck MRK is scheduled to report third-quarter 2025 results on Oct. 30. Investors are likely to focus on the sales performance of its blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda. The drug accounted for more than 50% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales during the first half of 2025. The company’s other oncology drugs, like Lynparza, Koselugo, Lenvima, and Welireg, are expected to have contributed to top-line growth.

However, with Keytruda facing a looming loss of exclusivity in 2028, investors are closely watching Merck’s non-oncology drugs, mainly its newly approved products, 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Capvaxive and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Winrevair.

Both Capvaxive and Winrevair witnessed a strong uptake during the first half of 2025. Capvaxive recorded sales of $236 million in the first half of 2025 and Winrevair generated sales worth $615 million during the same time.

We expect these two new drugs to have performed well in the third quarter, given the strong launch they have witnessed so far.

Merck’s Animal Health business is also a key contributor to its top-line growth, as the company is recording above-market growth. Revenues from the Animal Health business are likely to have risen in the third quarter. Our estimates for Animal Health suggest a CAGR of 5.9% over the next three years.

Merck’s newest respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody, Enflonsia (clesrovimab), was approved in the United States in June 2025, while it is under review in the EU. Merck is currently gearing up to launch Enflonsia to help protect infants entering their first RSV season.

A fixed-dose combination of doravirine and islatravir for the treatment of HIV is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in April next year.

MRK's Competition in the Target Market

While Merck’s new products show strong potential, competition in the target market also looms large.

Winrevair is likely to face stiff competition in the PAH market, which remains highly competitive. Significant players in the PAH market are United Therapeutics UTHR and J&J JNJ.

J&J’s key PAH drugs include Opsumit and Uptravi. JNJ recorded revenues of $2.14 billion from its PAH franchise in the first half of 2025.

UTHR markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States — Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca. United Therapeutics’ Remodulin, Orenitram and Tyvaso recorded sales of $272.9 million, $244.6 million and $935.9 million, respectively, in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, Enflonsia is also likely to face competition from AstraZeneca/ Sanofi’s RSV antibody Beyfortus, which was also approved for a similar indication in 2023.

Besides antibodies, some other vaccines have been approved for preventing RSV in certain patients in the United States. These include Pfizer’s Abrysvo, GSK’s Arexvy and Moderna’s mRESVIA.

MRK's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates

Year to date, shares of Merck have declined 12.3% against the industry’s rise of 5.5%. The stock has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.

From a valuation standpoint, Merck appears attractive relative to the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 9.33 forward earnings, lower than 15.56 for the industry and its 5-year mean of 12.63.

JNJ,7 Ways to Make Money From Your Investments (Beyond Dividends) - Barchart.com,,"Here’s a question for you — how many ways can you actually make money from your investments?

Most of us think you only make money from stocks and other financial instruments in two ways: when the price goes up, or when you get a dividend.

Some of you might be expecting me to say, “There’s a third way.” But no, it goes beyond that. There are several ways you can generate income using an existing portfolio. They come with different risks and returns, but they offer the same thing - steady, reliable, and predictable cash flow, which makes it perfect for longer-term or retirement portfolios.

By the end of this article you’ll know exactly which strategies might fit your style best. I’ll cover the most effective ways to generate income and see how each one compares to the others in terms of risk and return.

Let’s get to it.

Income Generating Strategy Definition

Before we dive into specific strategies, let’s get on the same page.

An income-generating strategy is an approach that focuses on instruments that offer passive, recurring, and safe cash flow over capital appreciation. The goal is to establish a consistent and reliable stream of income that can be used to build wealth, provide financial stability or freedom, or cover your living expenses without withdrawing too much of your capital, as is required by retirees.

Investments that provide income include dividend stocks, government and corporate bonds, interest-generating instruments, and even some option strategies - all of which I’ll cover over the course of this video. In other words, we’re not just chasing the next hot stock… we’re building a money machine that pays you whether the market is up or down.

Dividends

Let’s kick things off with the simplest and most popular strategy: dividend investing.

For example, if a company pays $2 per share annually, that means shareholders get $2 per year per share that they own, as long as they don’t sell the stock.

Dividend payout schedules and amounts depend on the company. Some pay quarterly, which is the most common, while some twice a year. Others even pay monthly like Realty Income or AGNC Investment Corp.

Now, when talking dividends, there’s something called yield, which compares the annual dividend you receive against the stock’s current trading price. This is expressed as a percentage. So, for example, that same stock that pays $2 a year, let’s say trades at $100 per share. So, that means, if you buy the company at $100 per share and receive the dividend, you are getting a 2% yield on your investment.

But you might be thinking, the higher the yield, the better, right? Not so fast. Yields are based on a stock’s trading price. So if a stock falls, its yield might look higher on paper — but that’s not always a good sign. In some cases, the company may be paying out more than it can realistically afford, which could lead to a dividend cut or even a complete stop.

That’s why yield alone isn’t enough. A company needs to have stable cash flow and consistent earnings to make those payments sustainable.

Think of it as giving a child an allowance. If the parent has a stable job with a reliable and consistent income, and if household expenses are kept under control, they can give the child a regular allowance. The more money the parent brings in, the higher the allowance can be.

However, if the parent loses their job or unexpected expenses arise, the allowance might be reduced or stopped altogether. That’s exactly how dividends work.

So, always consider the company’s earnings stability, payout ratio, cash flow, and dividend history - including it’s growth to judge whether the income is truly reliable.

Bottom line: dividends can be a steady income stream — but you want quality over quantity. Chasing yield alone can get you into trouble.

Types of Dividend Companies

But, here’s where it gets interesting — not all dividend stocks are created equal.

For example, did you know that some companies have paid increasing dividends for 25-plus years straight? The list is known as the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. And yes, if a company has been growing their dividends for more than two decades, it means a higher degree of reliability.

Companies included in these lists are Abbvie, Abbot Labs, Archer Daniels Midland and over 60 more. Now, there’s other, better-known companies in the Dividend Aristocrats list, but the reason why I separated them is, well, they intersect with the next group of stocks: Dividend Kings.

These companies have increased their dividends for 50 or more years straight. Imagine: 50 years of weathering the many economic downturns, market crashes, inflationary cycles, and shifting business landscapes.

Over the last 50 years, we’ve seen the rotary phone, the DVD, cassette tapes, VHS, and other once ubiquitous things come and go. These Dividend Kings, they’ve outlived them all. That’s the kind of consistency long-term investors want.

Companies in the Dividend Kings list include Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble.

There’s also the Dividend Zombies - and no, they’re not dead companies that pay dividends, if that even makes sense. They’re companies that have paid dividends for 100 years straight - no pauses. That said, they don’t necessarily have to increase their payouts for the full 100 years. That’s why not all Zombies are Kings, or even Aristocrats.

Other Types of Dividend Companies

And speaking of yield — let’s talk about some of the highest payers out there.

Aside from those long-term dividend growers, we also have REITs, and business development companies, or BDCs. Because of how they’re structured, these companies are required to pay out at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders, which, you guessed it, often leads to higher yields.

The drawback with REITs and BDCs is that they don’t get to keep much of their profit, so they don’t have as much left to reinvest in their businesses. Many of these companies raise capital through debt or issuing more shares, which can dilute existing shareholders.

That usually means slower growth, or in some cases, no growth at all in their stock price.

In short: REITs and BDCs can be fantastic for income, but these company’s don’t tend to increase their dividend like say, the Aristocrats.

So, if you’re after long-term reliability, look to Dividend Aristocrats and Kings. If you’re chasing yield, REITs and BDCs might give you more income, but they often trade growth for payouts.

Warning About Dividend Stocks

Now before you go looking for stocks with the highest dividends, here’s an important reality check.

So, there’s one thing about dividend stocks – even those in the Dividend Kings and Aristocrats lists – are not risk-free. The stock’s value can and will fluctuate over time, and the company may cut its dividend payments due to business hardship.

Investing in dividend stocks with reasonable yields offers medium returns for moderate risks. The higher the yield, the higher the risk.

So the lesson here is: stability beats excitement. The most sustainable income streams come from companies that can actually afford to keep paying you

The other type of income that’s available is interest income.

Treasury Bills & Bonds

And that leads me to a question — what if you could lend money to the safest borrower on the planet and get paid interest for decades?

The easy answer: invest in treasuries. These are short- or long-term debt securities issued by the US Treasury, that last anywhere between a few months for T-bills to as long as 30 years for Treasury bonds. They essentially serve as a way for you to lend money to the US government. And with that debt comes interest.

Let’s take the long-term ones- treasury bonds - as an example. The US government pays bondholders a fixed interest rate, and today, it’s around 4.8-4.9% annually for the 30 year bond. The bond value itself will go up and down over time, but at maturity, you’d paid the par value - which was the initial value of the bond when it was issued.

The payments are called coupons, and they represent the income you get when buying treasuries, and they’re paid twice a year.

And here’s the kicker: they’re one of, if not the, safest investments around. Unless the US defaults on its debts or ceases to exist in the next 20 or 30 years - both of which are extremely unlikely to happen - you can expect your coupon payments in full and on time. Treasuries won’t make you rich overnight, but they give you safety, stability, and predictable income.

Bond Laddering

But here’s the problem — locking up your cash for 30 years feels like forever. So what’s the workaround? That’s where bond laddering comes in.

Bond laddering means buying bonds with different maturity dates. As each bond matures, you take the proceeds and roll them into something else - maybe a stock, or maybe a new long-term bond at the far end of your timeline.

So, for example, you invest $10,000 in three bonds — one that matures in one year, another in two years, and the third in three years.

When the one-year bond matures, you can use the proceeds to buy a new three-year bond. That way, you always have bonds coming due in one, two, and three years.

This creates a rolling cycle where a bond matures every year, giving you consistent interest payments and some protection against sudden changes in rates.

Think of it like setting up financial dominoes — one falls every year, freeing up cash, while you keep the rest of the ladder working for you.

Options

Now, with all that out of the way, what if you’re already sitting on stocks in your portfolio? Is there a way to squeeze out extra income without selling them outright?

Covered calls is the answer to your question.

First, let’s go over the definitions.

An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified underlying asset at a specific price, known as the strike price, on or before a specified expiration date, in exchange for a fee, known as the premium. A call option gives you the right to buy the asset, while a put option gives you the right to sell.

On the other side of the trade, the seller or writer receives the premium in exchange for taking on the obligation to fulfill the contract should the buyer exercise their right. A seller fulfilling their obligation is called an assignment.

Covered Calls

Covered calls are my personal favorite — because it’s one of the most straightforward ways to turn the stocks you already own into a cash-flow machine.

A covered call is a strategy where you sell a call option against 100 shares of stock that you already own. When you sell a covered call, you’ll pick an expiration date and a strike price. The expiration date is when the option expires, and the strike price is the level you want the stock to stay below by expiration. That’s the goal.

If the stock crosses above that strike, you’ll sell your 100 shares at that strike price. So in general, with covered calls, you want to set the strike at a high enough price you’d be happy to sell your shares at.

But there’s the balancing act: the higher the premium, the lower the strike price — and the higher the chance you’ll get assigned. As an investor who prefers to hold onto my shares, I’d personally take a smaller premium in exchange for a better chance of keeping my stock. That’s the trade-off: less upfront cash, but more control over your long-term position.

Example

For example, let’s say you already own 100 shares of Johnson & Johnson. The stock today trades at $177.17 each, and maybe you want to sell a covered call on your shares.

The next thing you would do is choose the expiration date for your trade and identify a strike price that JNJ has a low chance of exceeding by that date.

So, let’s say you think that JNJ won’t trade at or above $185 in the next month. To check the trade details for a 185-strike call, navigate to the company’s profile page on Barchart, then click on ""Covered Call"" on the left side of the screen. Here, you’ll see suggested covered call trades, including all the details plus option analytics and probabilities.

I’ll switch the expiration date to October 3, which is 34 days away from the time of recording, then change the strike selection to Show All.

Once there, you’ll see the suggested trades with different strike prices. For the 185-strike trade, the screener suggests selling a call for 62 cents per share or $62 total. It also has a relatively low delta of -0.16, which means it’s less likely to get assigned. That’s a key detail — a lower delta often means a higher probability you keep your shares.

In terms of returns, for this trade, you’re looking at a 0.4% return over the next 34 days, or 3.8% over the year. And with JNJ having a forward yield of 2.9%, you can potentially be looking at a total return of 6.7% a year.

That’s like getting paid twice — once from the dividend – and once from the option premium. And the risk? It’s relatively low. Worst case, if JNJ trades above the $185 strike at expiration, you’ll sell the 100 shares at that price. That’s cash deposited right into your account — and remember, you already keep the premium.

Now, you’re not limited to selling covered calls on dividend stocks. Maybe you have growth stocks in your portfolio like Microsoft or Nvidia - companies that pay little to no dividends. You can sell covered calls on them too, and let me tell you, the premiums are very juicy!

Cash-Secured Puts

But let’s flip the script — what if you have a little cash on the sidelines and you’re waiting for the right price to buy a specific stock?

Well, with a cash-secured put, you get paid to buy stocks at a discount.

Cash-secured puts involve selling a put option on a stock and collecting a premium. Like the covered call, you’ll pick a strike and expiration date. But there’s a twist. Remember, with a covered call, the only risk is having to sell your shares. With a cash-secured put, your risk is being obligated to buy 100 shares of the stock if it trades below the strike at expiration. So, you’ll only want to sell a put on a stock you’d actually want to own - because between now and expiration, you can get paid while waiting for the stock to drop to a price you’re comfortable owning it at. Think of it as getting paid to place a limit order.

Example

So, let’s say you’re thinking about buying Nvidia, but it’s always too expensive. Today it trades around $174. Let’s say you’d be happy to buy it at $160. Well, this is where you could generate a little income from the cash you already have, and potentially get the opportunity to buy 100 shares of Nvidia at $160 a pop.

So what do you do?

Let's start by visiting Nvidia’s profile page, select Naked Put from the Option Strategies selection, and let’s change the expiration date to October 3rd, for example, so we can see all the potential trades.

With this trade, you can sell a put on Nvidia and receive $2.30 per share, or $230 total, per contract. If Nvidia trades above $160 by October 3, then the put expires worthless and you get to keep the $230 premium in full. And by the way, you just got a 15.7% annualized return on your money. Not bad eh?

Then, you can sell another to get a steady income while waiting for Nvidia to dip below your strike price.

The important thing about cash-secured puts is that you have enough money to buy 100 shares of the stock if you get assigned.

You might also be tempted to use margin to sell puts - most brokerages offer margin, but I’d avoid that, especially if you’re selling options in retirement.

So, this strategy works best if you’re patient, disciplined, and only sell puts on companies you truly want to own anyway.

Other Income-Generating Option Strategies

By now you’re probably wondering — are those the only strategies, or are there more ways to get paid from your investments?

Income generation using options is not limited to covered calls or cash-secured puts.

There are also credit spreads like bull put and bear calls, which generate income and work best if you have smaller amounts of cash available to invest.

There are also more advanced strategies that include iron condors, which combine the two credit spreads and create a zone of profitability between the short put and short call strike prices.

That said, only the covered call allows you to generate income directly from the stocks you already own. And that’s why it remains one of the most popular choices for long-term investors like me.

You could think of this: dividends are your baseline paycheck, covered calls are your side hustle, and strategies like spreads or iron condors are advanced plays for those looking to maximize every opportunity.

Recap

There are a lot of income-generating strategies that you can apply to your long-term portfolio. And the exciting part? You don’t have to pick just one — the best investors often combine them.

In a typical retirement portfolio, you’d want a balanced mix of bonds, dividend stocks, and maybe even some options strategies to boost your income.

As long as you understand the risks and weigh them against the potential rewards, you can build a portfolio that pays you a steady, reliable, and predictable income for years to come.",Barchart.com,2025-10-22T18:24:09Z,https://www.barchart.com/education/make-money-from-investments,1.0,2025-10-25 13:55:04.663975,,0.1764705882352942
JNJ,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +8.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson & Johnson belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.53 per share, indicating a change of +24% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.86 points to a change of +8.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.46 indicates a change of +5.5% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson & Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",Yahoo!

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Johnson & Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $22.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.3%. The $88.38 billion and $90.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -5% and +2.6%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Johnson & Johnson reported revenues of $21.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.6%. EPS of $2.71 for the same period compares with $2.68 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.09%. The EPS surprise was +2.65%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Johnson & Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson & Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

JNJ,Tylenol-Maker Kenvue's Stock Is Down 30% in 2025. Its Fate May Be in the FDA's Hands.,,"Kenvue (KVUE) could really use some good news. The Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) spinoff faced longlasting troubles regarding its talc-based baby powder products, including allegations that they caused cancer and related lawsuits.

Now, the consumer health giant faces new troubles as President Donald Trump has accused its Tylenol product of increasing autism when used in pregnancy.

However, Kenvue is not backing off and taking the accusations head-on. In a submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company said, “The expansive scientific evidence developed over many years does not support a causal link [between Tylenol use and autism], as confirmed in the Food and Drug Administration’s own public statements. For over a decade, and as recently as August, FDA has fully evaluated the emerging scientific evidence and repeatedly concluded that the data do not support a causal association.”

Kenvue stock has faced tough trading action for its whole life as a separately traded unit. Its shares are down more than 22% over the past two years and 30% in the year to date.

About Kenvue

Kenvue is a pure-play consumer health company with well-known brands such as BAND-AID, Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, Aveeno, Johnson’s Baby, Zyrtec, and others in its stable. The company purportedly has a consumer base of about a billion in 165 countries and has a market cap of roughly $28.7 billion.

On a YTD basis, KVUE stock is down about 30%. However, the stock offers a dividend yield of 5.4%, which is more than double the sector median of 2.5%.

Yet, the sustainability of the dividend is questionable, as with a payout ratio of almost 75% and falling earnings, the scope for growth remains limited.

So, what should you make of KVUE stock? Is it all doom and gloom, or can Kenvue make a comeback? A look at its financial, strategic, and operational situation can give us an idea.

Financials Are Not as Bad as the Sentiment

Kenvue’s revenue and earnings decreased from the previous year. In fact, over the past two years, Kenvue’s earnings have witnessed a yearly decline.

However, Kenvue has been fairly consistent in beating estimates. In the most recent quarter, Kenvue reported earnings per share of $0.29, beating estimates of $0.28.

Net cash flow from operating activities was another bright spot, coming in at $1 billion for the first six months of 2025, significantly higher than the previous year’s figure of $727 million. Overall, Kenvue closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.07 billion, lower than its short-term debt levels of $1.55 billion. The gap may not look material now, but the company should take steps to mitigate the decline in revenue and earnings so that its liquidity situation does not get out of hand.

Kenvue Has Been Here Before and Survived

What should give shareholders confidence is that Kenvue’s Tylenol was at the center of negative headlines before. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol. But the company is still here (and now spun off from Johnson & Johnson), and so is Tylenol, with no less than a billion dollars of sales last year.

This is because Tylenol continues to stand out as a preferred over-the-counter option for pain relief in the U.S. and many other countries, backed by decades of reliable performance and user confidence. For decades, medical professionals have turned to it first for tackling everyday pains or fevers, which has built up a brand following that’s a real hurdle for anyone trying to step in.

Kenvue, meanwhile, spreads its wings globally, balancing out its footprint across different regions and lines of business to better weather economic shifts. This kind of setup lets the company bring fresh products to market more nimbly and get them circulating worldwide with less friction. Driving that forward is a strong international R&D operation, pulling together 1,600 experts across science, healthcare, pharmacy, and engineering, giving it the heft for faster iteration and development of products.

Finally, the true strength of Kenvue’s position rests on how effortlessly its products have become embedded in consumers’ everyday habits. These span core areas such as personal hygiene, skincare, cosmetics, and essential categories like oral health and infant care. As staples in routine use, the brands have achieved deep market penetration and strong consumer endorsement. This foundation allows Kenvue to maximize revenue potential from its well-established portfolio.

Analyst Opinions

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about KVUE stock, attributing to it a rating of “Moderate Buy” with a mean target price of $20.36. This indicates upside potential of about 32% from current levels. Out of 16 analysts covering the stock, six have a “Strong Buy” rating, nine have a “Hold” rating, and one has a “Strong Sell” rating.",Barchart.com,2025-10-22T20:27:39Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35617613/tylenol-maker-kenvues-stock-is-down-30-in-2025-its-fate-may-be-in-the-fdas-hands,0.9999999999999999,2025-10-25 13:55:01.802011,,-0.1294117647058823
JNJ,A Golden Change in the Market,,"The Market
This week has been marked by a minor change. Perhaps a major one.
The fact that gold and the metals and quantum stocks and uranium and basically all the hot stocks of the last six weeks have come back down to earth signals a change to me.
Let me answer a question I seem to be getting on a daily basis: I am not a buyer of gold/GLD. There is no particular price I would be a buyer of (GLD) either. Will it bounce off that very steep blue line (call it 365-370)? I think it is likely.
This run in GLD has been far more relentless than any of the other GLD rallies in 2025. Take a look at the February peak and notice how it went sideways for nearly a month before heading up again. However, more recently, that peak in April gave way to four to five months of sideways action. I even recommended GLD at 310 back in late August. Why? Because it had spent so much time basing and consolidating.
Now I believe GLD will have to correct an awful lot or set up another big base as it had heading into September. I did not know in April that 310 would be the price. The price is a result of the pattern. So, until there is a pattern in GLD, I am not a buyer. I believe there needs to be a big shakeout there. I’d be taking something off the table, but I have been saying that since GLD was 340-350.
Then there are the quantum stocks and the space stocks and uranium and nuclear, etc. They may find some friends again and rally, but parabolic stocks are never my cup of tea. Let them come down and form another base, and I’ll gladly look at them again. But not now.
So, all we got today was another bout of group rotation.
New Ideas
I am going to do a few follow-ups again.
Last spring, I recommended Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) , and it has had a nice run. The stock has done nothing wrong, but there is a measured target in this 190-195 area. It’s not a bad idea to take a little off the table or at least anticipate a correction in the coming weeks.
Last spring, I was asked about the steel stocks, and my favorite of the three we looked at was Steel Dynamics (STLD) , which, up until recently, had been a pretty poor choice. There is a next measured target in the 155-160 area.
Last week, I said I thought the Utes were vulnerable, and now, along with the other hot trades over the last six weeks, the Utes have come down. Here, too, I need a pattern to set up for me to like them again. I am eyeing something down in the 86-88 area as the next spot, but that ought to be just a bounce. I will wait for the pattern again.
Today’s Indicator
The McClellan Summation Index stopped going down! This is the first time in over a month. It won’t take much to turn it back down (a net differential of -900 advancers minus decliners on the NYSE), but this would be a welcome change if it sticks.

I was asked to update my view on (TLT) . It has not changed. That 92-93 area continues to be my target for the time being. That doesn’t make me bearish on it here. On the contrary, I still think bonds are okay I just think this is a resistance area and I cannot chase. There is a possibility that TLT makes it to 94 just to suck everyone back in because that pattern under the blue line (a head and shoulders pattern I drew in at the time) measures to 93-94. I would also point out that the DSI on bonds is in the low 80s, so here too, we see sentiment would get stretched if we got much over these targets.
I am inclined to like Disney (DIS) , but I think it will take a lot to eat through resistance. In other words, I can see it getting to 117-118, then backing off again, then up to 120, then backing off again, and so on. So, you might need quite a bit of patience because remember, these group rotations are fits and starts.
I liked Uber (UBER) for the longest time, and it also took forever for it to make its way to that target of 100, which it achieved about a month ago. Now I would say I have no strong view. I think it has a chance of coming down to tag that uptrend line, or it could just slosh back and forth for a while.
The chart of DuPont (DD) has me intrigued because if we step back, we might consider this a long base in the making. Short term, it is over-extended, so I don’t want to chase it, but I have drawn in blue what would make the chart buyable to me. That means crossing the line (it doesn’t have to go to 85, just cross the line enough to see it) and then pull back and hold that line (call it 80-81) if it can hold on that pullback, I’d be a buyer.
Daqo New Energy (DQ) is not a great chart. It broke out, had a nice run, and then went plop. If it comes back near 23 and can hold, I would take another look at it, but right here I’m inclined to stay away.
Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) hasn’t done anything wrong, but it has met its measured target. Now it needs to either set up a new pattern or spend a decent amount of time going sideways. I’d be inclined to sell some if it breaks 70.
I keep staring at the chart of Gap (GPS) and that long sideways action, wondering if it is building a base or if it will simply continue to bounce back and forth. With the exception of April and May, the chart has been in a four-point trading range for a long time. I’d like to see it cross that red line and then come back and test it as I have drawn in blue. If it can map out like that, it would give me more confidence that it can actually break out. Otherwise, the trading range carries on.
Grupo Financiero (GGAL) is trying to form a bottom, but I think that 37-40 area is going to be a decent roadblock for the time being. I’d like to see this go sideways for at least a few more weeks or months to give me confidence that it can actually eat through all that resistance it left overhead. It’s made some progress by forming that W in the last two months.
BOIL is an ETF to be long natural gas. I want to love the chart, but I think 35 is going to be difficult to get through. A few months of sideways in this 25-35 area would make the chart much more enticing to me. For now, I’d call it a trading stock. Conceptually, this ought to be a good area (energy)
Carrier (CARR) is my kind of chart. It came all the way down to the April lows, held, and rallied. This is quite similar to the chart of Target (TGT) that I recommended a few weeks ago when it did the same.
Here’s the issue: I have no way of calculating a target yet. A pullback in the next few days toward 58.50-ish would form a tiny little head and shoulders bottom that would give a next target near 64.",TheStreet Pro,2025-10-21T22:48:32Z,https://pro.thestreet.com/trade-ideas/a-golden-change-in-the-market,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-25 13:55:23.742880,,0.0117647058823529

JNJ,Merck's Non-Oncology Drugs Q3 Performance: What to Expect,,"Merck MRK is scheduled to report third-quarter 2025 results on Oct. 30. Investors are likely to focus on the sales performance of its blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda. The drug accounted for more than 50% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales during the first half of 2025. The company’s other oncology drugs, like Lynparza, Koselugo, Lenvima, and Welireg, are expected to have contributed to top-line growth.

However, with Keytruda facing a looming loss of exclusivity in 2028, investors are closely watching Merck’s non-oncology drugs, mainly its newly approved products, 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Capvaxive and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Winrevair.

Both Capvaxive and Winrevair witnessed a strong uptake during the first half of 2025. Capvaxive recorded sales of $236 million in the first half of 2025 and Winrevair generated sales worth $615 million during the same time.

We expect these two new drugs to have performed well in the third quarter, given the strong launch they have witnessed so far.

Merck’s Animal Health business is also a key contributor to its top-line growth, as the company is recording above-market growth. Revenues from the Animal Health business are likely to have risen in the third quarter. Our estimates for Animal Health suggest a CAGR of 5.9% over the next three years.

Merck’s newest respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody, Enflonsia (clesrovimab), was approved in the United States in June 2025, while it is under review in the EU. Merck is currently gearing up to launch Enflonsia to help protect infants entering their first RSV season.

A fixed-dose combination of doravirine and islatravir for the treatment of HIV is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected in April next year.

MRK's Competition in the Target Market

While Merck’s new products show strong potential, competition in the target market also looms large.

Winrevair is likely to face stiff competition in the PAH market, which remains highly competitive. Significant players in the PAH market are United Therapeutics UTHR and J&J JNJ.

J&J’s key PAH drugs include Opsumit and Uptravi. JNJ recorded revenues of $2.14 billion from its PAH franchise in the first half of 2025.

UTHR markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States — Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca. United Therapeutics’ Remodulin, Orenitram and Tyvaso recorded sales of $272.9 million, $244.6 million and $935.9 million, respectively, in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, Enflonsia is also likely to face competition from AstraZeneca/ Sanofi’s RSV antibody Beyfortus, which was also approved for a similar indication in 2023.",Yahoo!

JNJ,3 ASX ETFs I'd buy if I could only invest once a year,,"Not everyone has time to check the market every day or track the latest company announcements.

For many Australians, life is simply too busy, yet the goal remains the same: to grow wealth steadily over time without constant effort.

That's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in. They offer an easy way to invest in world-class stocks in a single trade. And for time-poor investors, the right ETFs can keep compounding quietly in the background, even if you only top them up once a year.

Here are three ASX ETFs I'd happily buy and hold on that schedule.

VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (ASX: MOAT)

The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF could be a standout choice for investors who want quality without complication. It invests in US stocks that analysts believe possess ""wide moats."" These are durable competitive advantages that make it difficult for rivals to compete.

This means you are not just buying the biggest stocks; you are buying the most resilient ones. The fund's portfolio currently includes leading names such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Nike (NYSE: NKE), and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). These are businesses with strong brands, loyal customers, and sustainable pricing power.

Because the ASX ETF is actively rebalanced based on valuation and competitive strength, investors don't need to worry about timing the market or picking individual winners. For time-poor investors seeking high-quality, long-term compounding from globally recognised businesses, it is a simple and powerful option.

Betashares Global Quality Leaders ETF (ASX: QLTY)

If you could only buy one global ETF each year, the Betashares Global Quality Leaders ETF would be near the top of my list. It invests in some of the world's strongest and most consistently profitable companies.

The fund's holdings include Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Visa (NYSE: V), Nestle (SWX: NESN), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). These are companies known for their stability, earnings power, and global reach.

For investors with limited time, the Betashares Global Quality Leaders ETF provides a sleep well at night approach to global investing. It quietly goes about its business, diversifying across industries and regions, focusing on high-quality names, and allowing compounding to work steadily in the background.

Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS)

Closer to home, the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF offers simple exposure to the ASX 300, capturing around 90% of the Australian share market's total value.

That means instant diversification across major sectors like banking, mining, healthcare, and retail, all in one investment. Its top holdings include BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), and Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), giving investors access to the backbone of the Australian economy.

For investors who only want to invest once a year, it could be a great way to capture the long-term performance of the local market without the stress of picking individual stocks.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-22T11:15:32Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/22/3-asx-etfs-id-buy-if-i-could-only-invest-once-a-year/,0.6,2025-10-25 13:55:17.752453,,0.223529411764706

JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's Nipocalimab Shows Promise In Reducing Sjögren's Disease Severity,,"(RTTNews) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced results from the Phase 2 DAHLIAS study, published in The Lancet, demonstrating that nipocalimab—an investigational FcRn-targeting therapy for Sjögren's disease (SjD)—significantly reduced disease activity and severity in patients with moderate-to-severe SjD.

The study met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant improvement in ClinESSDAI scores at Week 24 in the nipocalimab 15 mg/kg Q2W group versus placebo. These reductions were supported by favorable biomarker changes, including lower rheumatoid factor levels, fewer circulating immune complexes, and decreased inflammatory markers.

Patients receiving nipocalimab reported symptom relief, with numerical improvements over placebo in hallmark SjD symptoms such as dryness (mouth, eyes, and/or vagina), fatigue, and joint pain. Notably, objective salivary flow improved in more than twice as many patients in the high-dose group compared to placebo at Week 24. Nipocalimab was well tolerated, with no new safety signals observed during the 24-week treatment period.

IMAAVY is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adult and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older) with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG, in Brazil by ANVISA for anti-AChR, anti-MuSK or anti-LRP4 antibody positive adults and pediatric patients aged 12 and older, and in Japan by the?Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for the treatment of all patients living with gMG.

JNJ,Johnson & Johnson Reports Strong 52-Week Data For Oral Psoriasis Drug Icotrokinra,,"(RTTNews) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) released new 52-week Phase 3 results from the ICONIC-TOTAL study evaluating icotrokinra, a first-in-class oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor in adults and adolescents (12+) with plaque psoriasis (PsO) affecting high-impact sites such as the scalp, genitals, hands, and feet.

Presented at the 2025 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference, the data showed sustained and high rates of site-specific clearance. By Week 52, 72% of patients with scalp psoriasis achieved a scalp-specific IGA score of 0/1, while 85% with genital psoriasis reached a genital PGA score of 0/1. Among patients with hand or foot psoriasis, clearance improved from 42% at Week 16 to 62% at Week 52.

Overall, 67% of patients treated once daily with icotrokinra achieved clear or almost clear skin and 44% achieved complete clearance by Week 52. Results were consistent between those treated throughout the study and those who transitioned from placebo at Week 16. Safety profiles remained stable with no new adverse signals detected.

Dr. Edward Lain, Executive Director of the Austin Institute for Clinical Research, said the durable responses demonstrate icotrokinra's promise as a long-term, effective option for patients whose psoriasis affects sensitive areas. Johnson & Johnson's Immunodermatology VP, Dr. Liza O'Dowd, noted the treatment's goal is to set a new standard by combining targeted precision, strong efficacy, and a favorable safety profile in a once-daily oral format.

Icotrokinra, discovered through a collaboration between Protagonist Therapeutics and Janssen Biotech (a Johnson & Johnson company), is also under evaluation in other Phase 3 ICONIC studies for plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.

JNJ,Tylenol-Maker Kenvue's Stock Is Down 30% in 2025. Its Fate May Be in the FDA's Hands.,,"Net cash flow from operating activities was another bright spot, coming in at $1 billion for the first six months of 2025, significantly higher than the previous year’s figure of $727 million. Overall, Kenvue closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.07 billion, lower than its short-term debt levels of $1.55 billion. The gap may not look material now, but the company should take steps to mitigate the decline in revenue and earnings so that its liquidity situation does not get out of hand.

Kenvue Has Been Here Before and Survived

What should give shareholders confidence is that Kenvue’s Tylenol was at the center of negative headlines before. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol. But the company is still here (and now spun off from Johnson & Johnson), and so is Tylenol, with no less than a billion dollars of sales last year.

This is because Tylenol continues to stand out as a preferred over-the-counter option for pain relief in the U.S. and many other countries, backed by decades of reliable performance and user confidence. For decades, medical professionals have turned to it first for tackling everyday pains or fevers, which has built up a brand following that’s a real hurdle for anyone trying to step in.

Kenvue, meanwhile, spreads its wings globally, balancing out its footprint across different regions and lines of business to better weather economic shifts. This kind of setup lets the company bring fresh products to market more nimbly and get them circulating worldwide with less friction. Driving that forward is a strong international R&D operation, pulling together 1,600 experts across science, healthcare, pharmacy, and engineering, giving it the heft for faster iteration and development of products.

Finally, the true strength of Kenvue’s position rests on how effortlessly its products have become embedded in consumers’ everyday habits. These span core areas such as personal hygiene, skincare, cosmetics, and essential categories like oral health and infant care. As staples in routine use, the brands have achieved deep market penetration and strong consumer endorsement. This foundation allows Kenvue to maximize revenue potential from its well-established portfolio.

Following the transfer and Nanobiotix analysis of the latest information, Nanobiotix estimates that NANORAY-312 interim data will be analyzed and reported, after both the requisite number of events have been observed and the last patient has been recruited, in 1H2027.

Future guidance related to NANORAY-312 and other JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)-related J&J-sponsored studies will be communicated by J&J. Nanobiotix will continue to provide JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development updates and guidance related to Nanobiotix-sponsored studies as well as studies sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

Given the Company’s focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023, Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.

Critical patient-reported SjD symptoms including dryness, pain and fatigue trended towards greater improvement in the nipocalimab-treated group compared to placebo-treated patients

Nipocalimab is the only investigational treatment to be granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by U.S. FDA for the treatment of adults living with moderate-to-severe SjD, and the Phase 3 DAFFODIL study is currently enrolling patients

SPRING HOUSE, Pa., Oct. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today announced findings from the Phase 2 DAHLIAS study published in The Lancet showing that nipocalimab, an investigational FcRn treatment for Sjögren's disease (SjD), significantly decreased disease activity and severity in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.1

The study met its primary endpoint, with statistically significant improvement in ClinESSDAIa score, a key SjD activity index, at Week 24 in the nipocalimab 15 mg/kg Q2W group compared to placebob.1 Reductions in disease activity were supported by favorable changes in key biomarkers when compared to placebo, including lower levels of rheumatoid factor, fewer circulating immune complexes, and decreased inflammatory markers.1

This significant reduction in disease activity suggests nipocalimab may lessen the burden of SjD symptoms for patients impacted by the condition.1 Patients who received nipocalimab reported a decrease in symptoms, with numerical improvements compared with placebo in the hallmark symptoms of SjD including dryness of the mouth, eyes, and/or vagina, as well as fatigue and joint pain.1 Additionally, an improvement in objective salivary flow (i.e., at least 50% increase from baseline) was observed in more than twice as many patients in the high dose nipocalimab group (15 mg/kg) compared to the placebo group (33% vs. 16%, respectively) at Week 24.1

""The DAHLIAS Phase 2 study represents an important step forward in the understanding of FcRn inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach in Sjögren's disease. By demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity and reductions in key biological indicators, nipocalimab may offer an avenue for addressing the autoantibody-driven pathology of this complex condition,"" said Ghaith Noaiseh, M.D., Associate Professor, Allergy, Clinical Immunology, and Rheumatology, The University of Kansas Medical Centerc. ""The ability of nipocalimab to potentially lower IgG autoantibody levels rapidly and reversibly is consistent with the mechanism of FcRn inhibition and does so without broadly suppressing the immune system.""2,3

Nipocalimab had a tolerable safety profile and no new safety signals were observed during the 24-week treatment period.1 Immune function was preserved throughout treatment, even among patients who experienced significant reductions in circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels.1 There was no observed increase in serious infections and no participants required intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or rescue therapy.1 The DAHLIAS data are consistent with the overall safety profile of IMAAVYTM (nipocalimab-aahu), which is approved in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).4

""A significant unmet need exists in the treatment of Sjögren's disease, a condition in which patients, 9 out of 10 of which are women, live with persistent and often debilitating symptoms, yet there are no approved therapies available,""5,6 said Leonard L. Dragone, M.D., Ph.D., Disease Area Leader, Rheumatology and Autoantibody, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""These data published in The Lancet add to the growing body of evidence supporting the potential of nipocalimab in Sjögren's disease. This publication not only underscores the scientific merit of the findings but also reflects our commitment to advancing research in autoantibody-mediated diseases and delivering innovative therapies for patients with few alternatives.""

Nipocalimab is the only investigational treatment to be granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SjD (November 2024). It also received Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA earlier this year in April 2025. Building on the regulatory momentum, the Phase 3 DAFFODIL study is now underway and actively enrolling patients.

IMAAVY™ is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adult and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older) with AChR or MuSK antibody positive gMG, in Brazil by ANVISA for anti-AChR, anti-MuSK or anti-LRP4 antibody positive adults and pediatric patients aged 12 and older, and in Japan by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for the treatment of all patients living with gMG.

Health authority submissions seeking approval for nipocalimab in the treatment of gMG are currently under review with several regulatory authorities worldwide.

ABOUT SJÖGREN'S DISEASE

Sjögren's disease (SjD) is one of the most prevalent autoantibody-driven diseases for which no therapies are currently approved that treat the underlying and systemic nature of the disease.7 It is a chronic autoimmune disease that is estimated to impact approximately four million people worldwide and is nine times more common in women than men.5,6 SjD is characterized by autoantibody production, chronic inflammation, and lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. Most patients are affected by mucosal dryness (eyes, mouth, vagina), joint pain and fatigue.7 More than 50% of SjD patients have a moderate to severe form of the condition, and disease burden can be as high as that of rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.5 It is usually associated with impaired quality of life, and in up to approximately half of patients, a loss of functional capacity that can result in an inability to work due to a disability.5,8,9,10

ABOUT DAHLIAS

DAHLIAS (NCT04968912) is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, dose-ranging study to evaluate the effects of nipocalimab in participants with moderately-to-severely active primary SjD who were seropositive for anti-Ro60 and/or anti-Ro52 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. 163 adults aged 18-75 were randomized 1:1:1 to receive intravenous nipocalimab at 5 or 15 mg/kg, or placebo every 2 weeks through Week 22 and received protocol-permitted background standard of care. Safety assessments were conducted through Week 30. The primary endpoint was change in baseline in the ClinESSDAI (Clinical European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index) Score at Week 24.

ABOUT IMAAVY™ (nipocalimab-aahu)

IMAAVY™ is a monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies that underlie generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) without additional detectable effects on other adaptive and innate immune functions. IMAAVY™ is currently approved for the treatment of gMG in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who are AChR or MuSK antibody positive.4

Nipocalimab is continuing to be investigated across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Rheumatic diseases.11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 The investigational monoclonal antibody is designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating IgG auto and alloantibodies potentially without additional detectable effects on other adaptive and innate immune functions.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including:

U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019, gMG in December 2021, fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia) FNAIT in March 2024 and SjD in March 2025

U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023

U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjögren's disease in November 2024

U.S. FDA granted Priority Review in gMG in Q4 2024

EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 and FNAIT in April 2025

The legal manufacturer for IMAAVY™ is Janssen Biotech, Inc.

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

VOO,Vanguard Gets the VOO Proxy Vote Out,,"Investors in the world’s biggest ETF will soon be able to say how they want their shares voted in proxies, such as one for the world’s largest pay package for the world’s richest person.

Starting next year, Vanguard is extending its 500 Index Fund, including the VOO ETF, to its Investor Choice program, which gives fund investors a handful of proxy voting options. Those include a policy to follow corporate board recommendations, a third-party advisor’s policy aimed at maximizing wealth, one to mirror other shareholders’ votes, one directed by Vanguard and another following ESG recommendations. That latter is offered by Glass Lewis, which along with fellow proxy advisor ISS, recommended opposing a proposed 10-year total compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $1 trillion and increase his proportional ownership in the company.

That’s almost as much as Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund, which sits at about $1.4 trillion.

Not Entirely by Choice

Vanguard, along with other massive firms like BlackRock and State Street, rolled out policy voting guidelines a few years ago. “This is also a way for Vanguard to address the issue of its size. Regulators (and critics) have raised concerns about Vanguard’s significant stake in corporate America and questioned how it uses that influence and voting power,” said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. “This program lets Vanguard deflect those criticisms: Vanguard can say it’s not ‘controlling’ how all of its shares are voted, it’s letting individual investors direct its votes.” Regardless, it can be seen as a win for the company and for fund shareholders, DeMaso said.

A look at Vanguard’s Investor Choice program, which is in its fourth year:

It currently applies to about $1 trillion in assets across numerous funds and will apply to $3 trillion, and 20 million investors, with the expansion announced on Tuesday.

However, only about 80,000 investors opted for a voting policy for the 2025 proxy season, but choices were somewhat evenly split, as no single policy got more than 35% adoption, according to Vanguard.

One Voice, Many Votes: It would be overwhelming, if not nearly impossible, for individual fund investors to direct how their shares are voted for every issue at every company, hence the need for broad policies. “Central to Vanguard Investor Choice is the core belief that investors should have the option to express a preference for how their index fund holdings vote,” Global Head of Investment Stewardship John Galloway said in a statement, adding that the goal is adding it to all the company’s US equity index funds.",Yahoo!

VOO,The Simplest Buffett-Inspired Portfolio You Can Build With Just $500,,"Key Points

Warren Buffett says the average investor is better off simply owning an S&P 500 index fund.

Investing in the S&P 500 gives instant access to some of America's most influential companies.

The Vanguard S&P 500 is one of the cheapest funds investors can find on the stock market.

10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›

When you've gained a net worth of over $140 billion and built a trillion-dollar business, people tend to give your advice more weight. That's why Warren Buffett has long been one of Wall Street's most respected voices. Even while being ultra-successful, he's never shied away from providing valuable investing advice for the average investor.

There's one piece of advice that has remained consistent through Buffett's career, and that's that the average investor is better off consistently investing in the S&P 500 as a means of building wealth over a lifetime. He has been quoted as saying, ""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.""

So, if you're looking for a Buffett-inspired portfolio, look no further than an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). It's one of the simplest ways to lean into his advice.

Why should you invest in the S&P 500?

The S&P 500 tracks around 500 of the largest U.S. companies on the stock market, so Buffett sees investing in an S&P 500 fund as a way to invest in the broader U.S. economy. Of course, smaller companies also make up part of the economy, but S&P 500 companies account for a large portion of the U.S. GDP. Below is how it's split by sector (as of Sept. 30):

Information technology: 34.8%

Financials: 13.5%

Consumer discretionary: 10.5%

Communication services: 10.1%

Health care: 8.9%

Industrials: 8.3%

Consumer staples: 4.9%

Energy: 2.9%

Utilities: 2.3%

Real estate: 1.9%

Materials: 1.8%

Buffett is likely not the biggest fan of the high concentration in tech stocks, but he can likely still appreciate the index containing companies from every major sector of the economy. It's not as diversified as it has historically been, but it still provides instant diversification to investors.

Being able to get exposure to 500 of America's most influential companies in a single investment simplifies investing. You don't need to spend time researching dozens or hundreds of companies; you simply invest in the S&P 500 and trust its ability to grow long term.

VOO gives you cheap exposure to the S&P 500

Buffett is also a fan of S&P 500 funds being cheap, which is why I went with VOO specifically over the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY). VOO's 0.03% expense ratio is more than three times cheaper than SPY's 0.0945% expense ratio.

Both are cheap, and a 0.645% difference may seem minimal but it adds up over time. And since both ETFs are essentially the same, you might as well go with the cheaper option of the two.

For perspective, let's imagine if you invested $500 monthly into both ETFs and they averaged 10% annual returns. The difference in paying 0.03% versus 0.945% in fees over 25 years is over $5,600.

Simple investing that has produced attractive gains

Investing in the S&P 500 doesn't have to mean sacrificing gains, either. One study by MarketWatch showed that around 65% of actively traded funds put together by Wall Street underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024.

Over the past decade, VOO has averaged around 12.6% annual returns (14.5% including dividends). That means a $500 investment made then would be worth over $1,600 to $1,900 today.

Nobody -- including Buffett and Wall Street experts -- can predict exactly how a stock will perform, especially in the short term. However, the S&P 500 is well-positioned to continue being an attractive long-term investment. That doesn't mean there won't be bumps in the road along the way, but history has rewarded patient investors.

But the boom hasn’t reached all corners of the ETF industry: Plenty of funds lost assets this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) have lost $31 billion and $9 billion in AUM year to date, respectively, according to VettaFi data. Experts attributed this to a combination of tariff concerns and cheaper alternatives.

“It’s just folks making tactical trades into other parts of the markets,” said Clark Allen, head of ETFs at the investment manager Horizon Investments. “Dollar weakness and concerns around the political climate and tariffs have happened this year, and that’s come to the detriment of SPY, but also to the benefit of international or growth-specific exposures.”

I SPY, With My Little Eye…

S&P 500 funds like SPY and IWM have been bleeding assets for several years as institutional investors allocate to cheaper alternatives with identical, or nearly identical, exposure. Increasingly popular SPY alternatives are State Street’s SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which have expense ratios of .02% and .03%, respectively, far cheaper than SPY’s and IWM’s .09% and .19% fees. “The S&P 500 is the S&P 500, whether you buy it for nine basis points or for two or three,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF trends research at VettaFi. “So why not pay two or three?”

Other ETFs that have seen more than $6 billion in net outflows this year include:

The iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF (EFG), which had $7.9 billion in outflows.

The Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ), which had $6.5 billion in outflows.

Still, the tables could turn for SPY. “We tend to see, in the fourth quarter, institutional investors hide out in SPY,” Rosenbluth said. “If [institutional investors are] outperforming the broader market in December, they might ride that out by replicating the broader market and putting money into SPY.” Despite the outflow woes, he added, SPY probably isn’t going anywhere because of its status as a premium product that offers above-average liquidity.

Low-Energy. State Street’s Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) also had massive outflows totaling $8.2 billion year to date, which Horizon’s Allen said is evidence of decreasing energy prices. The war in Ukraine gave energy-heavy funds a boost back in 2022, but the sector has since underperformed relative to tech. “You’ve seen energy struggle,” Allen said. “I think it’s folks just saying, ‘Hey, I can’t hang on any longer, and I need to pivot into areas that I think are going to drive growth into the future.’”",Yahoo!

VOO,The battle of S&P 500 funds is over -- and the cheaper one won,,"For decades, one exchange-traded fund (ETF) ruled the S&P 500 landscape. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust — better known by its ticker symbol SPY — held the crown as the world's largest exchange-traded fund since its launch in 1993. Wall Street traders and Main Street investors alike poured money into this giant, making it the go-to choice for anyone who wants to invest in the 500 largest U.S. companies.

But not anymore. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) overtook SPY in 2025 to become the largest ETF by assets under management. VOO now holds roughly $772 billion in assets, compared with $677 billion for SPY. The gap keeps widening, with VOO gaining $124.4 billion this year, while SPY shed more than $46 billion.

So what happened — how did an ETF that launched 17 years after SPY manage to dethrone the longtime champion?

The fee difference adds up fast

The answer may come down to one simple factor: cost.

VOO charges an expense ratio of just 0.03%, while SPY costs 0.0945%. These expense ratios are the annual fee you pay to own shares of the fund, taken as a small percentage of your investment.

Here's what those percentages mean in real dollars:

That difference might not seem like much year to year. But those extra fees come straight out of your returns — and they accumulate over time.

Let's say you invest $100,000 and leave it alone for 30 years. Assuming an 8% average annual return, here's what you'd end up with:

It means you’d end up paying about $18,000 more for highly similar assets.

Both funds own the same 500 companies in the same proportions. Both go up and down together. The main difference is how much of your money disappears into fees.

SPY's 1990s design holds it back

There's another reason SPY struggles to keep pace with VOO, and it comes down to the way the fund was built back in 1993.

SPY launched as a unit investment trust (UIT). UITs were a common structure back then, but they come with limitations that seem outdated today. One key limitation is that SPY can't automatically reinvest your dividends.

Here's how dividends work in SPY

The 500 companies in the S&P 500 may pay dividends throughout the year. When SPY receives those dividend payments, the fund is legally required to pass them directly to you as cash. It can't keep that money and use it to buy more stocks on your behalf.

Instead, SPY collects all the dividends it receives and distributes them to shareholders once per quarter. During that waiting period, the cash just sits there doing nothing. It's not earning returns. It's not compounding. It's just waiting.

If you want those dividends reinvested, you have to set up a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) through your brokerage. Most brokers offer this feature, but the reinvestment happens at the brokerage level outside the fund.

How VOO handles dividends

VOO operates as an open-ended fund, which gives it more flexibility. When cash dividend payments come in from the S&P 500 companies, VOO can reinvest that money back into those companies until the quarterly payout. From there, you’ll still need a DRIP to reinvest the payouts you receive.

This structure also helps VOO handle taxes more efficiently. When large institutional investors cash out, VOO can choose which specific stocks to hand over. By giving them the stocks with the biggest gains, VOO removes those potential tax bills from the fund. This helps reduce future taxes for everyone who stays invested.

Which fund should you choose?

SPY dominates among active traders thanks to its unmatched trading volume, with more than 73 million shares changing hands on a typical trading day. Day traders and institutional investors value this liquidity, which enables them to execute large trades more easily and quickly without affecting the price.

SPY also has an extensive options trading market, where investors can buy and sell contracts based on the fund's future price movements. These contracts let traders protect existing positions or speculate on price swings.

VOO, on the other hand, has a smaller daily trading volume of about 7 million shares. Yet, it has clearly become the preferred choice for retail investors focused on long-term wealth building. People saving for retirement over decades tend to prioritize low fees over high liquidity or complicated financial tools like options contracts.

Since VOO, SPY and other S&P 500 ETFs hold the same 500 companies, their performance is virtually identical before fees. Owning both doesn't add any diversification, as you're simply duplicating the same investment. The main difference comes down to costs and how you plan to use the fund.

5 investing basics that work with any S&P 500 fund

Whether you choose VOO, SPY or other S&P 500 ETFs, these core principles apply to building wealth through index funds:

Dollar-cost averaging smooths out the ride. This simple strategy involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of market conditions. When prices drop, the same dollar amount buys more shares. When prices rise, it buys fewer. This approach helps reduce the pressure of trying to time the market.

Time in the market beats timing the market. A hypothetical investor who missed just the best 5 days in the market since 1980 would have reduced their gains by 37%. The problem is nobody knows which days will be the best days until after they happen.

Dividend reinvestment puts more of your money to work. Most brokerages offer automatic reinvestment through a simple setting. When enabled, your dividends buy more shares. Those additional shares generate their own dividends, which buy even more shares. Over time, this compounding effect can significantly boost your share holdings.

Market downturns happen regularly. The S&P 500 has dropped 20% or more roughly once every six years on average. These bear markets feel unsettling in the moment, but historically, the market has always eventually recovered and gone on to new highs. Selling during a downturn locks in losses, while staying invested can help you join the recovery.

Low costs keep more money in your pocket. Funds with higher fees often promise sophisticated strategies or active management, but those features don't guarantee better returns. A fund charging 0.50% needs to outperform a 0.03% fund by nearly half a percentage point just to deliver the same returns after fees. That's a significant hurdle, especially compounded over decades.

VOO,Vanguard Gets the VOO Proxy Vote Out,,"Investors in the world’s biggest ETF will soon be able to say how they want their shares voted in proxies, such as one for the world’s largest pay package for the world’s richest person.

Starting next year, Vanguard is extending its 500 Index Fund, including the VOO ETF, to its Investor Choice program, which gives fund investors a handful of proxy voting options. Those include a policy to follow corporate board recommendations, a third-party advisor’s policy aimed at maximizing wealth, one to mirror other shareholders’ votes, one directed by Vanguard and another following ESG recommendations. That latter is offered by Glass Lewis, which along with fellow proxy advisor ISS, recommended opposing a proposed 10-year total compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $1 trillion and increase his proportional ownership in the company.

That’s almost as much as Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund, which sits at about $1.4 trillion.

Not Entirely by Choice

Vanguard, along with other massive firms like BlackRock and State Street, rolled out policy voting guidelines a few years ago. “This is also a way for Vanguard to address the issue of its size. Regulators (and critics) have raised concerns about Vanguard’s significant stake in corporate America and questioned how it uses that influence and voting power,” said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. “This program lets Vanguard deflect those criticisms: Vanguard can say it’s not ‘controlling’ how all of its shares are voted, it’s letting individual investors direct its votes.” Regardless, it can be seen as a win for the company and for fund shareholders, DeMaso said.

A look at Vanguard’s Investor Choice program, which is in its fourth year:

It currently applies to about $1 trillion in assets across numerous funds and will apply to $3 trillion, and 20 million investors, with the expansion announced on Tuesday.

However, only about 80,000 investors opted for a voting policy for the 2025 proxy season, but choices were somewhat evenly split, as no single policy got more than 35% adoption, according to Vanguard.",The Daily Upside,2025-10-23T14:53:45Z,https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/vanguard-gets-the-voo-proxy-vote-out/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:56:28.230705,,0.2078431372549019
VOO,"Market Close Stock Round Up October 22, 2025: Dow Jones Edges Lower as Blue-Chips Lose Momentum",,"It's Wednesday, October 22, 2025, just before market close. Below is your easy to follow summary of how the stock market moved during trading hours, brought to you by International Business Times. Let's dive in.

U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Wednesday, with all three major indexes dipping as investors weighed mixed corporate earnings and renewed concerns over inflation. The S&P 500 slipped 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 declined 1.3%, extending a recent stretch of uneven trading across Wall Street.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) closed at $666.37 after trading between $663.40 and $672.38 throughout the session. The Dow-tracking SPDR DIA ETF ended at $465.39, while the Invesco QQQ Trust — a proxy for the Nasdaq's largest technology names — finished at $603.54 after touching an intraday low near $599.84. Trading volumes remained moderate as investors avoided major risk-taking ahead of upcoming economic data releases.

Market sentiment appeared cautious as traders continued to assess the broader inflation outlook and potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy. Analysts said the lack of clear momentum in either direction reflects investor uncertainty following a series of mixed earnings reports and uneven macroeconomic indicators. Tech and growth stocks led the day's declines, while more defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples outperformed modestly.

Despite the declines, strategists described the pullback as orderly and consistent with typical consolidation following strong recent gains. ""We're seeing investors pause rather than panic,"" one market analyst said. ""Until we get clarity on the Fed's next steps or inflation trends, it's likely we'll continue to see days like this — flat to slightly negative with rotation beneath the surface.""

S&P 500 Performance (SPY)

U.S. equities ended lower Wednesday, with the S&P 500 easing roughly 0.8% as investors turned cautious following mixed earnings and lingering inflation worries. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) closed at $666.09, down 0.78%, after trading between $663.40 and $672.38. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) followed closely, finishing at $612.18, off 0.80% on the day. Both funds, which mirror the benchmark S&P 500 index, moved nearly in lockstep — reflecting broad-based softness across large-cap sectors including technology and industrials.

Despite the decline, analysts described the session as a modest retreat rather than a sharp sell-off, noting that both SPY and VOO remain up more than 15% year-to-date. Traders pointed to light volume and limited catalysts ahead of key economic data later this week. ""It looks more like consolidation than concern,"" one market strategist said, as investors continue to gauge the Federal Reserve's next move and the durability of corporate earnings.

NASDAQ Composite Index Performance (QQQ)

The QQQ closed at $603.09, down about -1.36% on the day, as tech and growth stocks weakened amid investor caution. The fund traded between an intraday high of roughly $611.78 and a low near $599.84, reflecting some intraday volatility.

While the move isn't dramatic, the decline outpaced the broader market drop (for example, the large-cap benchmark tracked by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)) — underscoring how growth/tech-oriented stocks are bearing more pressure in today's climate. Longer-term, QQQ remains a dominant vehicle for exposure to major non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Index Performance (DIA)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped Wednesday, tracking broader market weakness as investors digested mixed earnings results and awaited fresh economic data. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) closed at $465.41, down 0.81%, after fluctuating between $469.54 and $464.48 throughout the session. Blue-chip names in the industrial, financial, and consumer sectors weighed on the index, with traders citing profit-taking and cautious sentiment following recent gains.

Market analysts described the retreat as mild and expected, with volume staying near seasonal averages. ""It's a pause more than a pullback,"" one strategist noted, emphasizing that the Dow remains near multi-month highs despite today's dip. The decline followed a similar pattern seen across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, where investors rotated away from risk-heavy sectors in favor of defensives ahead of upcoming inflation data and Federal Reserve commentary.",International Business Times,2025-10-22T19:25:49Z,https://www.ibtimes.com/market-close-stock-round-october-22-2025-dow-jones-edges-lower-blue-chips-lose-momentum-3788067,1.0,2025-10-25 13:56:38.216209,,0.02745098039215677
VOO,Market Meltdown Coming? These 2 ETFs Are Ready to Surge If Stocks Tank,,"The U.S. stock market has delivered impressive gains for over a decade, but warning signs of a potential downturn are mounting. Inflation remains sticky, interest rates hover at levels that could squeeze corporate profits, and geopolitical tensions from ongoing trade disputes to conflicts abroad add layers of uncertainty. Analysts point to overvalued tech stocks and slowing consumer spending as red flags for the S&P 500.

In a crash scenario, where domestic indices plummet 20% or more, diversification becomes essential. Investors often overlook opportunities outside U.S. borders, where economic cycles may decouple from American woes. Regions with lower valuations and faster growth potential could offer a buffer, allowing portfolios to weather the storm while positioning for recovery.

This approach doesn't guarantee profits but provides a pragmatic hedge against prolonged U.S.-centric declines.

Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA)

For investors seeking stability beyond the U.S., the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:VEA) stands out as a low-cost gateway to mature economies. Launched in 2007, VEA tracks the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index, holding over 4,000 stocks from countries like Japan, the U.K., Canada, and Switzerland. It excludes emerging markets and the U.S., focusing instead on established firms with proven track records.

Top holdings include ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), SAP (NYSE: SAP), and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), but with hundreds of companies in its portfolio, no one stock accounts for more than 1.5% of the fund. Yet these companies span technology, healthcare, and industrials, providing broad sector balance.

What makes VEA compelling in a potential S&P 500 crash? Its geographic spread reduces correlation to U.S. events. During the 2022 market dip, when the S&P 500 fell 19%, VEA declined only 14%, thanks to resilience in European and Asian developed markets.

Fast-forward to recent performance: Over the past year through October 22, 2025, VEA delivered a total return of 22%, surpassing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's (NYSEARCA:VOO) 15.5%. This edge came from strong rebounds in Japanese equities, driven by export growth, and steady European gains amid easing energy pressures.

Looking at three year returns, VEA does slip behind VOO with cumulative returns of 77% to 87%, respectively, but VOO -- like the S&P 500 itself -- has become dominated by the tech giants, which account for the lion's share of the index's performance. That alone makes the S&P more risky.

With an expense ratio of only 0.03%, it keeps more returns in investors' pockets. In a crash, VEA's slightly lower volatility -- its standard deviation is around 12% versus VOO's 13% -- could limit drawdowns.

Analysts at Morningstar rate VEA highly for its diversification benefits, noting it adds value without excessive risk. For those holding VOO, allocating about a quarter of your portfolio to VEA could smooth returns over cycles. Recent inflows hit $10.5 billion in 2025, signaling institutional confidence. As U.S. stock valuations stretch, VEA offers a value tilt that might shine if recession fears materialize.

Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO)

Shifting to higher-reward plays, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:VWO) targets economies in rapid transition, like China, India, and Taiwan. Introduced in 2005, VWO mirrors the FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index, with roughly 5,500 holdings emphasizing large- and mid-cap stocks.

It captures about 90% of the emerging market investable universe, with heavy weights in financials, tech, and consumer goods. Leading positions feature Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Tencent Holdings, and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), accounting for over 20% of assets. This setup bets on demographic booms and urbanization trends that U.S. markets have largely exhausted.

In crash scenarios, VWO's appeal lies in its countercyclical dynamics. Emerging markets often lag in U.S.-led booms but recover vigorously when dollar strength wanes or commodity prices rise. Historical data shows that after 2008, VWO had cumulative total returns of 71% in the following three years while the S&P 500 managed 88%. More recently, over the past year, VWO posted a total return of 18.2%, topping VOO's 15.54%. It's up 24% year-to-date. Gains were fueled by India's robust GDP growth at 7% annually and China's stimulus measures boosting tech and property sectors.

On a three-year basis, VWO's annualized return of 7.8% trails VOO's 8.2% slightly but remains competitive, especially given emerging markets' 12% volatility matches VOO's while offering higher yields -- VWO's dividend is 2.7% versus VOO's 1.1%.

At 0.07% expense ratio, costs are negligible. Key drivers include Reliance Industries, an Indian conglomerate in energy and telecom, which has surged 25% in 2025 on domestic consumption. If an S&P crash stems from Fed tightening, a weaker dollar could propel VWO, as seen in 2020 when it outperformed by 10 points during the pandemic recovery.

Critics highlight currency risks and political volatility, but VWO's broad diversification mitigates single-country blows -- China is capped at 30%. BlackRock strategists recommend it for 10% to 15% portfolio slices in downturn hedges.

With $138 billion in assets, VWO has drawn $5 billion in net flows this year, underscoring its role as a growth engine. As U.S. tech stalls, VWO's P/E of 11 presents bargains in undervalued regions poised for catch-up.",Yahoo!

VOO,The Simplest Buffett-Inspired Portfolio You Can Build With Just $500,,"When you've gained a net worth of over $140 billion and built a trillion-dollar business, people tend to give your advice more weight. That's why Warren Buffett has long been one of Wall Street's most respected voices. Even while being ultra-successful, he's never shied away from providing valuable investing advice for the average investor.

There's one piece of advice that has remained consistent through Buffett's career, and that's that the average investor is better off consistently investing in the S&P 500 as a means of building wealth over a lifetime. He has been quoted as saying, ""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.""

So, if you're looking for a Buffett-inspired portfolio, look no further than an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO +0.83%). It's one of the simplest ways to lean into his advice.

Why should you invest in the S&P 500?

The S&P 500 tracks around 500 of the largest U.S. companies on the stock market, so Buffett sees investing in an S&P 500 fund as a way to invest in the broader U.S. economy. Of course, smaller companies also make up part of the economy, but S&P 500 companies account for a large portion of the U.S. GDP. Below is how it's split by sector (as of Sept. 30):

Information technology: 34.8%

Financials: 13.5%

Consumer discretionary: 10.5%

Communication services: 10.1%

Health care: 8.9%

Industrials: 8.3%

Consumer staples: 4.9%

Energy: 2.9%

Utilities: 2.3%

Real estate: 1.9%

Materials: 1.8%

Buffett is likely not the biggest fan of the high concentration in tech stocks, but he can likely still appreciate the index containing companies from every major sector of the economy. It's not as diversified as it has historically been, but it still provides instant diversification to investors.

Being able to get exposure to 500 of America's most influential companies in a single investment simplifies investing. You don't need to spend time researching dozens or hundreds of companies; you simply invest in the S&P 500 and trust its ability to grow long term.

VOO gives you cheap exposure to the S&P 500

Buffett is also a fan of S&P 500 funds being cheap, which is why I went with VOO specifically over the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY +0.79%). VOO's 0.03% expense ratio is more than three times cheaper than SPY's 0.0945% expense ratio.

Both are cheap, and a 0.645% difference may seem minimal but it adds up over time. And since both ETFs are essentially the same, you might as well go with the cheaper option of the two.

For perspective, let's imagine if you invested $500 monthly into both ETFs and they averaged 10% annual returns. The difference in paying 0.03% versus 0.945% in fees over 25 years is over $5,600.

Simple investing that has produced attractive gains

Investing in the S&P 500 doesn't have to mean sacrificing gains, either. One study by MarketWatch showed that around 65% of actively traded funds put together by Wall Street underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024.

Over the past decade, VOO has averaged around 12.6% annual returns (14.5% including dividends). That means a $500 investment made then would be worth over $1,600 to $1,900 today.

Nobody -- including Buffett and Wall Street experts -- can predict exactly how a stock will perform, especially in the short term. However, the S&P 500 is well-positioned to continue being an attractive long-term investment. That doesn't mean there won't be bumps in the road along the way, but history has rewarded patient investors.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-22T12:45:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/22/simplest-buffett-inspired-portfolio-you-can-buy/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:56:44.146723,,0.3490196078431373
VOO,"Market Close Stock Round Up Oct. 24, 2025: Wall Street Rallies as Cooling Inflation Boosts Rate-Cut Hopes",,"Wall Street rallied Friday after fresh inflation data showed price pressures easing faster than expected, reinforcing hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon begin cutting interest rates. The upbeat economic report, combined with strong corporate earnings, lifted all three major indexes and capped a positive week for U.S. equities.

U.S. stocks ended sharply higher, with investors welcoming signs that inflation continues to cool while the economy remains resilient. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.0%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 advanced 1.1%, marking a broad-based rally across major sectors.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) closed at $677.25, up 0.8%, after trading between $672.62 and $678.46 throughout the session. The Dow-tracking SPDR DIA ETF ended at $472.21, rising 1.0%, while the Invesco QQQ Trust — a proxy for the Nasdaq's largest technology names — finished at $617.10, up 1.05%, after touching an intraday low near $612.57.

Trading volumes strengthened heading into the weekend as investors increased exposure to equities following favorable economic data. The September Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% month-on-month, below the 0.4% forecast, and 3.0% year-over-year, compared with expectations of 3.1%. The softer reading boosted confidence that the Federal Reserve could move toward its first rate cut in over a year, possibly as early as December.

Market breadth was positive, with nine of eleven S&P 500 sectors finishing higher. Technology, industrials, and financials led the advance, while utilities and real estate lagged modestly. Analysts noted that Friday's session extended the market's recent uptrend, supported by easing inflation pressures and solid third-quarter earnings.

S&P 500 Performance (SPY)

The S&P 500 climbed, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) closing at $677.25, up 0.80%, after trading between $672.62 and $678.46. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) finished at $622.38, also up 0.8% on the day.

All major large-cap sectors advanced, led by financials and consumer discretionary stocks, while energy posted moderate gains. The index remains up more than 16% year-to-date, reflecting continued optimism around corporate resilience and expectations of a more accommodative policy stance from the Federal Reserve.

NASDAQ Composite Index Performance (QQQ)

The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) closed at $617.10, rising 1.05% for the session, as technology and growth stocks outperformed. The ETF traded between an intraday high of $618.40 and a low of $612.57.

VOO,Why These 2 Crypto ETFs Could Soar After the Sell-Off,,"For the second year in a row, it looks like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will finish 2025 as the most popular financial instrument among investors and the financial advisors who recommend them.

In 2024, global ETFs set a record at $1.5 trillion. But of that, a record $1.1 trillion went into U.S. ETFs, shattering 2021’s record of $901 billion.

But while their role in many portfolios is to provide practical, broad diversification to entire indices, themes, or commodities such as gold, they are also increasingly being used by investors seeking equity market exposure to the crypto market. That’s because these funds offer a simplified approach that doesn’t require esoteric knowledge of things like gas fees, Web3 wallets, or the differences between hard and soft forks.

That has become very apparent to retail investors and institutional investors alike. By Oct. 15, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs inflows reached $48.7 billion, surpassing 2024’s total despite digital assets prices being highly volatile this month.

For investors looking to add crypto exposure without having to open a hot or cold wallet while stressing about remembering their private keys, two industry-leading crypto ETFs can provide access without having to directly own BTC or ETH.

Short-Term Volatility Makes for a Crypto Buying Opportunity

October—or “Uptober” among crypto enthusiasts—is historically a strong month for the crypto market. However this year, as is the case with many asset classes, crypto prices have been harder to predict.

That has been on display since the second week of October, when Bitcoin and Ethereum retraced more than 14% and nearly 20%, respectively, from their one-month highs to their one-month lows. But after running up more than 65% and nearly 208% from their year-to-date (YTD) bottoms before the sell-off, the two largest coins by market cap were overdue for some degree of correction.

In total, $500 billion was wiped out from the crypto market amid renewed trade tensions between the United States and China. Nonetheless, long-term trends remain intact, underscored by a crypto-friendly administration in Washington and continued weakness in the U.S. dollar—a currency that traditionally has an inverse relationship with BTC prices.

By Oct. 15, noting a near-term buy-low opportunity, investors rushed into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, staging a $340 million, one-day reversal. Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate, told CryptoNews.com that was attributable to “price-insensitive” ETF buyers who rebalance into weakness.

That bullish buying has some analysts suggesting that crypto, broadly, is entering an accumulation stage after finding support and could trade in a range before testing the next leg up. For investors looking to get in before that could happen, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF NASDAQ: IBIT and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF NASDAQ: ETHA remain down around 15% and 19%, respectively, from the YTD highs they hit earlier in August and October.

BlackRock’s 2 Big Crypto ETF Offerings

The spot ETFS—both of which are offered by the world’s largest asset management firm BlackRock NYSE: BLK and are backed by the coins—are two of the fastest growing funds globally.

In the company’s Q3 earnings call on Oct. 14, the executive team noted that it was now “exploring tokenizing long-term investment products like iShares” after seeing explosive demand for exchange-traded products such as IBIT and ETHA since their respective market debuts in January 2024 and July 2024.

In his comments, CEO Larry Fink noted that IBIT is now the largest crypto ETF, with net assets in excess of $100 billion at the time of the earnings call. While that may pale in comparison to the world’s largest ETF—the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF NYSEARCA: VOO and its more than $765 billion in net assets—for a crypto-leveraged fund that’s not even two years old, that demonstrates exponential growth.

Wall Street’s Smart Money Appears to Agree

Fink referred to the ETF’s surging popularity as “another proof point of [BlackRock’s] success” in adapting to evident demand for new market products. Institutional investors seem to agree with the CEO.

Over the past 12 months, IBIT has seen buyers outweigh sellers 1,287 to just 312, resulting in $10.21 billion in inflows versus $126 billion in outflows. Similarly, 219 ETHA buyers have outnumbered 35 sellers, with inflows of $1.07 billion dramatically outweighing outflows of just $116.66 million.

Meanwhile, IBIT’s short interest of 1.04% is nearly 16% lower than it was the month prior, which suggests that the bears are largely staying away from the fund. Ethereum tends to follow Bitcoin just how silver tends to follow gold. In that vein, short interest for ETHA stands at 5.96%—considerably higher than IBIT, but more than 61% lower than it was the month prior.

VOO,"""October Effect"" & ETF Investors' Insatiable Appetite for Risk",,"We are all familiar with the so-called October Effect.

Investopedia describes it this way: “The October effect refers to the belief that stocks tend to decline during the month of October. It is considered to be more of a psychological expectation than an actual phenomenon, as most statistics contradict the theory.”

It’s an interesting phenomenon, to use their word. We come into the month looking for an increased potential for market crashes, and an increase in volatility vs. previous months. We expect a deterioration of investor sentiment as the market swings. And, yet, we know we may also see the stock market display surprising resilience — historically speaking — with gains above average.

October brings a sort of good-meets-bad-meets-ugly that is likely to turn out great in the end.

So far this quarter, October 2025 has seemingly delivered on all those fronts. With an ongoing government shutdown, and concerns about its economic impact, October has already welcomed a pick up in volatility that saw the Cboe VIX Index hit, at one point, its highest level since those early-April tariff-related highs. Uncertainty — partly fueled by a lack of fresh economic data — looms large, and investors are nervous. And, yet, the market keeps on flirting with and/or forging new historic highs.

Equity ETF asset flows, perhaps surprisingly or perhaps not at all, tell us that investors are aware of the market noise, but they continue to bet heavily on stock market resilience with a side of caution.

Let’s look at some numbers.

More Large-Caps Please

Coming into Q4, equity ETFs had been taking in about 58% of all net asset creations this year across all asset classes. So far in October, equities ETFs have taken in 50% of all ETF asset flows, a haul that’s strong but lagging year-to-date levels in relative terms.

Within that asset gathering pace, however, we see an appetite for traditional large-cap exposure — as in S&P 500 exposure — that goes on undeterred. The top-three most popular ETFs this month are all tied to the broad benchmark.

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has picked up $7.8 billion in October.

SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) has picked up $5.2 billion in October.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has picked up $4.4 billion in October.

Together, these three ETFs have snagged roughly 37% of all equity ETF flows so far this month. And it’s the Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ) — you guessed it — that rings in at number four, with net asset creations of $2.6 billion in October, followed by the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), with $2 billion.

In other words, the top-five list of investor favorites this month looks like a who’s who among traditional passive equity ETF stalwarts.

The flip side is equally interesting. For all of our increasing fears and concerns about the path of economic growth, diversification within equities hasn’t been a big theme this month.

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) is the month’s biggest asset loser so far in October, bleeding over $3 billion in assets. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) comes second, with net asset redemptions of about $1.4 billion. Small-caps, equal-weighted portfolios — both well-liked diversifiers to large-cap concentration — are both leading outflows this quarter.

Can’t Get Enough Gold

It could be that diversification remains focused on one of the year’s biggest bullish stories, which continues to be reflected by insatiable investor appetite. That is gold.

In many ways, gold has emerged this year as the goldilocks asset, delivering that much-needed diversification from equities while offering capital appreciation as prices hit repeated new records, and acting as a safe-haven play to concerns about rising inflation.

We’ve all marveled at gold’s performance this year, and we continue to gasp at some of the price projections for the yellow metal going forward. Investors are buying a lot of physical gold ETFs this quarter.

So far in October, the commodities asset class of ETFs has snagged over 8.8% of all ETF asset flows. The top-three asset gatherers are all gold funds:

SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) has picked up $4.6 billion in October.

SPDR Gold Minishares Trust (GLDM) has picked up $1.1 billion in October.

iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has picked up $788 million in October.

October Effect Isn’t Real. Long Live October Effect

To go back to Investopedia, “statistical evidence” isn’t very strong that October brings weaker stock market performance, but “the psychological expectations” of a challenging October persist.

So far this month, The S&P 500 is up about 0.8%. The Nasdaq 100 is up nearly 2%. And gold has already tacked on 7% in gains this month.

“From a historical perspective, October has marked the end of more bear markets than the beginning,” according to Investopedia. “This makes October an interesting prospect for contrarian buying.”

So far, so good.

VOO,Why SPY Bled $31B This Year,,"They say a win for one is a win for all, but that might not hold true for ETFs.

The US exchange-traded fund market has made headlines this year for its massive growth, recently surpassing $12.7 trillion. But the boom hasn’t reached all corners of the ETF industry: Plenty of funds lost assets this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) have lost $31 billion and $9 billion in AUM year to date, respectively, according to VettaFi data. Experts attributed this to a combination of tariff concerns and cheaper alternatives.

“It’s just folks making tactical trades into other parts of the markets,” said Clark Allen, head of ETFs at the investment manager Horizon Investments. “Dollar weakness and concerns around the political climate and tariffs have happened this year, and that’s come to the detriment of SPY, but also to the benefit of international or growth-specific exposures.”

I SPY, With My Little Eye…

S&P 500 funds like SPY and IWM have been bleeding assets for several years as institutional investors allocate to cheaper alternatives with identical, or nearly identical, exposure. Increasingly popular SPY alternatives are State Street’s SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which have expense ratios of .02% and .03%, respectively, far cheaper than SPY’s and IWM’s .09% and .19% fees. “The S&P 500 is the S&P 500, whether you buy it for nine basis points or for two or three,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF trends research at VettaFi. “So why not pay two or three?”

Other ETFs that have seen more than $6 billion in net outflows this year include:

The iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF (EFG), which had $7.9 billion in outflows.

The Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ), which had $6.5 billion in outflows.

Still, the tables could turn for SPY. “We tend to see, in the fourth quarter, institutional investors hide out in SPY,” Rosenbluth said. “If [institutional investors are] outperforming the broader market in December, they might ride that out by replicating the broader market and putting money into SPY.” Despite the outflow woes, he added, SPY probably isn’t going anywhere because of its status as a premium product that offers above-average liquidity.",The Daily Upside,2025-10-22T10:10:00Z,https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/why-spy-bled-31b-this-year/,0.7,2025-10-25 13:56:50.661721,,0.2549019607843137
VOO,"Trump Defies Own Mantra As 'America First' Includes Argentina - Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ARCA:VOO)",,"“America First,” President Donald Trump proclaimed in two inaugural addresses: 2016 and, again, in 2025—unless you’re Argentina.

What Happened?

The U.S. Treasury, under Secretary Scott Bessent, finalized a $20 billion financial lifeline for Argentina in the form of a currency swap, allowing Argentina's central bank to exchange pesos for U.S. dollars.

The loan earned Argentina’s President Javier Milei a visit to the White House on Oct. 14, where he met with Trump, Bessent and top U.S. officials.

The move also came amid a government shutdown, drawing questions from lawmakers, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren, about the prioritization of foreign aid during fiscal constraints. After all, it was Trump who ordered the formation of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to crack down on federal spending, both in the U.S. and abroad.

So much for that (spending has actually increased).

And given the lack of a strong financial relationship between the U.S. and Argentina, observers scratched their heads. Why does Milei need such a large loan when the U.S.’s own growing debt load recently topped $38 trillion?

Why Does It Matter?

This $20 billion infusion is seen as an emergency lifeline to stabilize Argentina’s financial markets amidst a major economic crisis, including a sinking peso and escalating capital flight.

At the time of reporting, the Treasury Department had not released details about the terms of the swap, and the dollars involved are U.S. taxpayer funds: just tweets.

Yet, the gesture raises eyebrows given the Trump administration’s prior stance on reducing foreign spending, even bypassing the legislative branch to cut pre-approved funds.

Who's Involved?

Key figures in this story include:

Milei, Argentina’s president, a libertarian and Trump ally, whose economic reforms have seen mixed results.

Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary, is responsible for the deal and its implications on global financial stability.

Robert Citrone, a billionaire hedge fund manager and close friend of Bessent, is heavily invested in Argentina's financial recovery and stands to benefit from the bailout, according to the WSJ.

Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, also pals with Bessent, invested in Argentina after Milei’s election victory. Bessent denies that cronyism played a role in the decision to prop up Argentina.

Fidelity, BlackRock, PIMCO, major U.S. investment firms with significant exposure to Argentina, adding further American interest in stabilizing the country's economy.

Trump, who OK’d the Argentina rescue that aided wealthy investors at a time when federal workers aren't getting paid due to the longest government shutdown in history.

What's The Backstory?

The U.S. has historically used tools like currency swaps to stabilize global markets.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve set up swap lines with major central banks to provide liquidity in dollars, preventing a global liquidity squeeze.

In 2011, amid the European debt crisis, the Fed reestablished swaps to ease pressure on European banks. Similarly, in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed expanded swap lines with several countries, ensuring dollar access to stabilize markets and support economic recovery.

These measures helped safeguard global financial stability.

This situation is different due to the political dynamics, complicated by Milei, who implemented controversial economic policies that have destabilized Argentina's economy.

Wealthy investors like Citrone and Druckenmiller like Argentina’s high-risk, high-reward opportunities. The current economic instability can lead to undervalued assets, which investors look to buy up in anticipation of a rebound. The country also issues high-yield debt to attract investors, despite the risk of default. For these investors, Argentina offers an opportunity to diversify portfolios, capitalize on distressed assets, and profit from Milei’s reforms.

What's The Reaction?

U.S. soybean farmers feel slighted. China used to be America’s leading soybean customer. Not anymore. Argentina now ships its soybeans to China ever since the trade war with Trump escalated.

Also, legislation introduced to solve the shutdown and payments for federal workers has stalled.

Still, both the S&P 500, as tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), and the Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), are just shy of reaching fresh highs.

What Happens Next?

Whether this financial intervention will be viewed as a one-off or a sign of ongoing U.S. commitment to Argentina's economic recovery remains to be seen.

It’s also unclear whether Argentina’s financial struggles could affect other economies.

Officials also worry that Argentina, a key South American economy, may deepen its ties with China. If the deal leads to long-term stabilization, it could become a model for future financial interventions.

However, if Argentina’s situation worsens, the political ramifications could be significant both domestically and internationally.

Argentina’s next legislative elections are scheduled for October 26.

VOO,What's Behind Surging Rare Earth Elements ETFs?,,"Everyone knows Big Tech is booming, but what about the minerals it depends on?

The rare earths industry is taking off, and investors are noticing. The stocks of companies like Arafura Rare Earths, Lynas Rare Earths and MP Materials, which mine and refine the metals that help power everything from smartphones to wind turbines, have all more than doubled this year (with some climbing well beyond that), and ETFs investing in the companies have garnered massive inflows. (VanEck’s Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF, REMX, brought in more than $200 million week over week as of Monday.) The boom reflects both political and technological developments — rare earths are now being used in AI infrastructure — and should be taken seriously by investors, experts said.

“I think we see the tailwinds continuing for the foreseeable future, in addition to this newfound pocket of demand from data centers and AI,” said Nate Miller, vice president of product development at Amplify ETFs.

Miss Independent

Part of the recent surge stems from an agreement signed by President Trump and the Australian Prime Minister on Monday to invest $3 billion into the sector over the next six months. The US government has also pledged to ban Chinese sourcing for certain metals by Jan. 1, 2027, which is all the more reason for US investors to shift their dollars away from Chinese supply chains, said Daniel O’Connor, CEO of the media and intelligence platform Rare Earths Exchanges. (The company is working on launching an ETF that would invest in the rare earth supply chain outside of China, which also tightened restrictions on exports earlier this month.) “Right now, a little under 100% of heavy rare earth elements are processed in China,” O’Connor said. “What this means is if the US military needs to develop something and they don’t have access, they’re out of luck … So there’s enormous pressure [to diversify].”

ETFs investing in rare earths companies have outperformed of late:

VanEck’s Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF (REMX), which provides broad sector exposure, investing in mining companies and tech providers, is up 85% YTD.

Amplify ETFs’ Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT), which invests in the metals that go into batteries, is up 48% YTD.

The iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF (PICK), which tracks an index of mining and production companies, is up 34% YTD.

Silver and Gold … And Lithium: Miller says rare earths can play an important supporting role in investors’ portfolios. “In the same way somebody might think about an allocation to gold or silver in a complementary sense, you could think about [rare earths] here as adding further diversification,” Miller said. “When other things are treading water or aren’t performing well, you can see really strong returns out of these companies and the materials behind them.”

VOO,"'Einstein Of Wall Street' Peter Tuchman Urges Young Investors To Stop Buying Stuff, Start Investing In Stocks For Lifelong Wealth - Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ARCA:VOO)",,"The veteran NYSE trader Peter Tuchman, known as the ""Einstein of Wall Street,"" is calling on younger generations to rethink their spending habits and focus on long-term wealth through stock investments.

‘Invest in Stocks, Not Stuff,’ Tuchman Advises Young Consumers

Tuchman, who has spent more than 40 years navigating market highs and lows, shared his advice in a video posted by TikTok channel The School of Hard Knocks, reported Fortune.

""One of the most important things is to invest in stocks and not stuff,"" Tuchman said. ""Pretty much most things we buy goes down in value the minute you buy it.""

Use Familiar Products To Guide Smart Investments

Tuchman, who trades between half a billion and a billion dollars in stock daily, pointed to the consumer habits of today's youth as a key concern.

""Young people are the greatest consumer generation in the world, pouring money into products that depreciate immediately rather than assets that appreciate over time,"" he explained.

He encouraged aspiring investors to use familiar trends to guide investments: ""Go back to high school, walk down the corridor and look at what sneakers everyone's wearing, what phones they use, what computers they're on…buy a little bit of each one of those companies.""

Tuchman also highlighted the power of compound interest, noting that a monthly investment of $250 in the S&P 500 from age 18 could grow to over $1 million by retirement.

""It's letting your money work for you,"" he said.

Ramsey Portfolio Strategy: Growth, Income & International Funds

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey, known for advising people on eliminating debt, typically recommended investing in growth and income funds with a long-term focus.

In June, Brian Preston and Bo Hanson on The Money Guy Show compared a hypothetical portfolio based on Ramsey's investing approach with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the classic three-fund portfolio, which combined U.S. stocks, international equities, and bonds.

Preston explained that Ramsey's strategy suggested splitting a portfolio equally among four categories: growth and income, growth, aggressive growth, and international.

The podcast hosts selected the following funds for the Ramsey-inspired portfolio: Columbia Large Cap Index Fund Class A (NASDAQ:NEIAX) for growth and income, JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund Class R3 (NASDAQ:JMGPX) for growth, American Funds EUPAC R4 (NASDAQ:REREX) for international and Franklin Small Cap Growth Fund Class A (NASDAQ:FSGRX) for aggressive growth.

VOO,Is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a Buy?,,"Key Points

The S&P 500's technology concentration has swelled to roughly one-third of the index, transforming this ""broad market"" fund into an artificial intelligence (AI) and megacap growth play.

The fund's 0.03% expense ratio keeps more returns in investors' pockets.

Dollar-cost averaging into the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers a disciplined approach to navigating today's rich multiples while maintaining long-term market exposure.

10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›

Every seasoned investor knows the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks America's 500 largest companies, given that it tracks the benchmark S&P 500 index. What's less obvious is that owning it today means significant exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) theme.

Thanks to the AI juggernaut, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has delivered a total return -- including dividends -- of 15.7% in 2025 through Oct. 21. That being said, the index isn't cheap. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio sits around 23, above its 25-year average, and the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio has climbed to approximately 40.2 as of early October.

Is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a buy right now? Let's take a closer look at its valuation, growth vectors, and risks to find out.

The accidental AI fund

The S&P 500 no longer resembles the balanced industrial index of decades past. Technology stocks now make up roughly one-third of the index, with recent estimates near 34% as of late 2025. Add AI-heavy names from communication services and consumer discretionary, and recent estimates show the top 10 stocks now account for approximately 40% of the benchmark -- a concentration that would make many sector-specific ETFs jealous.

That concentration isn't a flaw; it's the point. Market-cap weighting mirrors where U.S. corporations generate the bulk of their profits. Today's fund has effectively a cap-weighted AI and megacap growth tilt. Nvidia commands roughly 7.9% of the index, Microsoft approximately 6.7%, Apple about 6.6%, Amazon around 3.7%, Meta Platforms at 2.8%, and Alphabet's combined classes total approximately 4.5%.

These companies didn't reach trillion-dollar status by luck. They dominate because they control the infrastructure behind AI, cloud computing, and next-generation consumer tech. The fund delivers exposure to all of that innovation for a microscopic 0.03% expense ratio -- about $3 a year for every $10,000 invested.

By contrast, many active funds charge 10 to 20 times more and still fail to beat the index. That cost advantage, combined with automatic exposure to America's most profitable companies, is what makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's simplicity so powerful.

The valuation reality

Valuations remain elevated. A forward P/E around 23 exceeds the 25-year average, and a CAPE ratio near 40.2 sits well above the historical mean of 17.3, but still below the all-time peak of 44.2 reached in December 1999.

The counterargument is that today's megacap tech giants generate cash flows and margins that justify higher valuations than traditional industrial companies. Still, premium prices demand premium patience.

A 20% to 30% drawdown at these valuations isn't just possible based on history -- it's plausible during the next recession or market panic. The question isn't whether volatility will arrive, but whether you can stomach it long enough to capture the recovery.

Is the Vanguard S&P 500 a buy?

Despite these headwinds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF remains compelling for specific investors. Long-term savers using dollar-cost averaging can actually benefit from volatility, accumulating shares when corrections arrive. At these multiples, dollar-cost averaging is a practical discipline that diversifies entry points while keeping costs near zero. Tax-conscious investors appreciate the ETF's structural efficiency -- minimal capital gains distributions mean you control when to realize taxes.

For those worried about valuations but wanting exposure, consider blending strategies. Worried about concentration? Pair the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF with the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which charges a 0.20% expense ratio to even out weights and reduce the megacap tilt. Then add global ballast with the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF at a 0.05% expense ratio for broad ex-U.S. exposure when American multiples compress.

VOO,"Stocks Soar To Records After Weak CPI, Ford Jumps 10% - Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH)",,"Wall Street surged to fresh all-time highs Friday as a softer-than-expected inflation reading strengthened market conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its Oct. 30 policy meeting.

The annual headline inflation came in at 3% in September 2025, slightly up from August’s 2.9% pace but below expectations of 3.1%. When excluding food and energy items, core inflation was cooler-than-expected, falling from 3.1% to 3% year-over-year.

The S&P 500 broke above the 5,800 level, rising 1% on the day and extending its year-to-date gain to 15%. Gains were broad-based across sectors, with every S&P 500 group advancing except energy, while tech led the rally.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.2% to 47,290, setting a new record, while the Nasdaq 100 also climbed 1.2% to 25,370, marking another all-time high.

Small caps led the charge, with the Russell 2000 soaring 1.7% to 2,520, just shy of its record high of 2,560.

Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) was the top-performing large-cap stock of the day, soaring 10% in its best session since 2022, after the company posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.

The automaker reported earnings per share of $0.45, well above analysts' expectations of $0.36. Revenue came in at $50.53 billion, beating the consensus forecast of $47.05 billion. The company cited resilient demand and improving margins, particularly in its truck segment.

In the small-cap space, Inhibrx Biosciences Inc. (NASDAQ:INBX) jumped more than 90% after announcing encouraging trial results for its cancer drug ozekibart.

Gold prices held steady around $4,130 per ounce on Friday but are set to close the week down 2.8%, snapping a nine-week winning streak after a sharp selloff earlier in the week.

Oil prices extended gains amid escalating supply concerns linked to U.S. sanctions on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, which added fresh geopolitical risk to global energy markets. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose above $62 a barrel, climbing 9% for the week in its strongest performance since June.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) held flat at $110,000.

VOO,Here's Why One Fund Invested $38 Million in an International Stock ETF,,"Adventist Health System West reported a new position in IXUS valued at approximately $38.2 million as of September 30, according to an SEC Form 13F filed on Tuesday.

What Happened

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing released Tuesday, Adventist Health System West established a new position in the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS +0.39%). The fund acquired approximately 462,368 shares for a total transaction value of $38.2 million during the third quarter.

What Else to Know

This new position in IXUS represents 6.2% of Adventist Health System West's reportable 13F assets under management as of September 30.

Top holdings after the filing:

NYSEMKT:VOO: $300.4 million (48.9% of AUM)

NYSEMKT:VEA: $67.8 million (11% of AUM)

NYSEMKT:ITOT: $67.1 million (10.9% of AUM)

NASDAQ:VONV: $61.9 million (10.1% of AUM)

NASDAQ:VTIP: $38.8 million (6.3% of AUM)

As of Thursday, shares were priced at $83.98, with a one-year change of 20% versus a 16% gain for the S&P 500.

ETF Overview

ETF Snapshot

IXUS's investment strategy seeks to track the MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI Index, providing broad exposure to developed and emerging markets equities outside the United States.

The fund is structured as a passively managed ETF designed for long-term international equity allocation.

It serves as a core holding for diversified international portfolios due to its large asset base and broad market coverage.

The iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS) offers investors comprehensive access to global equity markets outside the United States, combining both developed and emerging market exposures in a single fund. With its large asset base, it serves as a core holding for diversified international portfolios. The fund's broad market coverage and transparent indexing approach provide investors with efficient, scalable exposure to non-U.S. equities.

Foolish Take

Adventist Health’s latest move reinforces its pivot toward broad, diversified global exposure after also trimming an emerging-market position last quarter. The nonprofit hospital network’s investment arm purchased roughly $38 million worth of the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS) in the third quarter, giving it a new 6.2% portfolio weight. The shift, which coincided with Adventist’s full exit from the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, suggests a preference for stability and scale over regional concentration as global equities rally.

Adventist Health System West, which manages about $600 million in equity assets to support its $6 billion nonprofit healthcare operation, invests like an institutional endowment—aiming to balance long-term growth and liquidity for hospital expansion and patient services. IXUS offers exposure to both developed and emerging markets outside the U.S., capturing over 4,000 global stocks through a low-cost, passive approach.

For long-term investors, this kind of shift underscores a cautious optimism toward international equities. By reallocating from volatile emerging markets into a broader, diversified ETF, Adventist appears to be positioning for steadier compounding—an approach consistent with its conservative, mission-driven investment philosophy.

VOO,"Delayed Inflation Report Looms: Will It Shake Fed's Next Move? - Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ARCA:VOO)",,"After a nine-day delay caused by the ongoing government shutdown, September's Consumer Price Index report will finally land Friday morning, and economists say its impact on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path – and thus on markets –could be bigger than usual.

The data, which arrives without crucial context from other key economic releases like jobs, retail sales and wholesale inflation, is now the first official data point in over two weeks.

As such, it could carry extra weight in shaping expectations for whether the Fed cuts rates in its Oct. 30 meeting — and how aggressively it continues easing into year-end.

What Are Economists Expecting?

The consensus view is that inflation in September will edge higher again.

According to the median economist consensus tracked by TradingEconomics, the annual headline inflation is expected to rise to 3.1%, up from 2.9% in August.

The month-over-month inflation rate is expected to be 0.4%, while core CPI — which strips out food and energy — is forecast to rise 0.3%. The annual core inflation is predicted to remain steady at 3.1% year-over-year.

Bank of America economist Stephen Juneau said they forecast both headline and core inflation to rise 0.3% in the month, adding, ""If our forecast is correct, we do not think the report will be a game changer for the Fed.""

He still expects a 25-basis-point rate cut next week.

Market participants are now pricing in a near-certainty of a 25-basis-point rate cut at next week's Fed meeting, with strong odds (90%) of another cut in December.

Used Cars Flat, Tariffs May Add Some Pressure

According to analyst Ayesha Tariq, much of the expected inflationary strength is likely to come from energy and food, with gasoline prices estimated to have risen 1.5% in the month. But it’s the lingering effects of tariffs — particularly on goods like communication equipment, furnishings and recreation — that are keeping pressure on prices.

Used car prices are expected to stay flat after several months of drag, while airfares could fall as much as 1.5%. On the housing front, rent inflation continues to decelerate, according to both Bureau of Labor Statistics data and private sector indices.

Still, core services — especially those unrelated to housing — are proving sticky, with analysts estimating a 0.3% increase for September. That would keep the year-over-year pace near 3.5%, well above the Fed's 2% target.

""Even if the Fed does cut rates next week, I think the messaging will be hawkish and there will be some harsh commentary from Fed Powell on the lack of data due to the Government Shutdown. It's his turn to poke the Administration back for all the jabs he's endured in the last few months,"" Tariq stated.

What Are Investors Expecting?

According to the latest 22V Research investor survey, there is a growing belief that inflation is on a ""Fed-friendly glide path.""

A majority of respondents — 61% — said they believe core inflation is cooling in line with the Fed's goals, while just 27% think financial conditions need to tighten further, down sharply from prior months.

Notably, for the first time since July, the dominant expectation is for a risk-on market reaction to the CPI report. About 45% of investors anticipate markets to rally on the data, while only 26% expect a risk-off move.

Interestingly, nearly half the investors surveyed believe that others will see the CPI's market impact as negligible — a signal that sentiment may be turning more dovish beneath the surface.

The survey also captured a meaningful drop in recession expectations, with only 12% of investors now predicting a downturn.

Wall Street Eyes New Record Highs

A softer-than-feared inflation print on Friday could be the final catalyst that propels U.S. equities to fresh all-time highs, as investor optimism builds around a dovish turn from the Fed.

The S&P 500 – as tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) – was trading at 6,750 points during Thursday's afternoon session, just 15 points below its Oct. 9 record of 6,765.

The Nasdaq 100 – tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) – hovered around 25,120, only 75 points shy of its Oct. 10 high of 25,195.

VOO,Oil Stocks Rally On Trump's Russia Sanctions: Markets Today - Alcoa (NYSE:AA),,"Energy markets dominated headlines Thursday as a fresh wave of U.S. sanctions targeting Russia's oil giants sparked a sharp rebound in crude prices and lifted energy shares.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump's administration imposed sweeping restrictions on Rosneft and Lukoil, ramping up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

VOO,Is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a Buy?,,"Key Points

The S&P 500's technology concentration has swelled to roughly one-third of the index, transforming this ""broad market"" fund into an artificial intelligence (AI) and megacap growth play.

The fund's 0.03% expense ratio keeps more returns in investors' pockets.

Dollar-cost averaging into the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers a disciplined approach to navigating today's rich multiples while maintaining long-term market exposure.

10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›

Every seasoned investor knows the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks America's 500 largest companies, given that it tracks the benchmark S&P 500 index. What's less obvious is that owning it today means significant exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) theme.

Thanks to the AI juggernaut, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has delivered a total return -- including dividends -- of 15.7% in 2025 through Oct. 21. That being said, the index isn't cheap. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio sits around 23, above its 25-year average, and the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio has climbed to approximately 40.2 as of early October.

Is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF a buy right now? Let's take a closer look at its valuation, growth vectors, and risks to find out.

The accidental AI fund

The S&P 500 no longer resembles the balanced industrial index of decades past. Technology stocks now make up roughly one-third of the index, with recent estimates near 34% as of late 2025. Add AI-heavy names from communication services and consumer discretionary, and recent estimates show the top 10 stocks now account for approximately 40% of the benchmark -- a concentration that would make many sector-specific ETFs jealous.

That concentration isn't a flaw; it's the point. Market-cap weighting mirrors where U.S. corporations generate the bulk of their profits. Today's fund has effectively a cap-weighted AI and megacap growth tilt. Nvidia commands roughly 7.9% of the index, Microsoft approximately 6.7%, Apple about 6.6%, Amazon around 3.7%, Meta Platforms at 2.8%, and Alphabet's combined classes total approximately 4.5%.

These companies didn't reach trillion-dollar status by luck. They dominate because they control the infrastructure behind AI, cloud computing, and next-generation consumer tech. The fund delivers exposure to all of that innovation for a microscopic 0.03% expense ratio -- about $3 a year for every $10,000 invested.

By contrast, many active funds charge 10 to 20 times more and still fail to beat the index. That cost advantage, combined with automatic exposure to America's most profitable companies, is what makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's simplicity so powerful.

The valuation reality

Valuations remain elevated. A forward P/E around 23 exceeds the 25-year average, and a CAPE ratio near 40.2 sits well above the historical mean of 17.3, but still below the all-time peak of 44.2 reached in December 1999.

The counterargument is that today's megacap tech giants generate cash flows and margins that justify higher valuations than traditional industrial companies. Still, premium prices demand premium patience.

A 20% to 30% drawdown at these valuations isn't just possible based on history -- it's plausible during the next recession or market panic. The question isn't whether volatility will arrive, but whether you can stomach it long enough to capture the recovery.

Is the Vanguard S&P 500 a buy?

Despite these headwinds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF remains compelling for specific investors. Long-term savers using dollar-cost averaging can actually benefit from volatility, accumulating shares when corrections arrive. At these multiples, dollar-cost averaging is a practical discipline that diversifies entry points while keeping costs near zero. Tax-conscious investors appreciate the ETF's structural efficiency -- minimal capital gains distributions mean you control when to realize taxes.

For those worried about valuations but wanting exposure, consider blending strategies. Worried about concentration? Pair the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF with the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which charges a 0.20% expense ratio to even out weights and reduce the megacap tilt. Then add global ballast with the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF at a 0.05% expense ratio for broad ex-U.S. exposure when American multiples compress.

VOO,"Tech Stocks Slump, Netflix Sinks 10% On Worst Day Since 2022 - Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC)",,"Risk sentiment deteriorated sharply on Wednesday as a wave of disappointing earnings guidance and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions rattled investor confidence.

The Trump administration is considering new restrictions on exports to China that would target products either made with or containing U.S.-developed software. If enacted, the measure could significantly curb global shipments of a wide range of goods to China, deepening the tech trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2% to 24,820 points, while the S&P 500 declined 0.7% to 6,690. Technology was the session's worst-performing sector, with semiconductor stocks leading losses. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) dropped 2.8%.

The VIX – also known as the market’s fear gauge – rallied 9% to 19.6 levels.

Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was the S&P 500's biggest laggard, plunging 10.2% in its worst session since April 2022. The streaming giant fell short of third-quarter profit estimates after incurring a $619 million tax dispute-related loss in Brazil, which overshadowed its otherwise strong content performance.

Other notable decliners included Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), down 7.2%, and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), which fell 7%.

On the upside, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) soared 14% after posting better-than-expected quarterly results.

Gold prices extended losses for a second straight day, with the metal falling 1.8% to $4,050 per ounce after Monday's dramatic 5.3% plunge. However, the renewed threat of U.S. tech export controls to China offered some intraday support to the safe-haven asset. Silver dropped another 1.2% to $48 per ounce, following Monday's volatile 7.1% slide.

Crypto sentiment also turned negative. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) slipped 0.3% to $108,000, while altcoins saw steeper declines. Shares of Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) dropped 6% and 4.9%, respectively.

VOO,Arsenal news: Arteta called out by player's angry brother as Haaland causes issues - The Mirror,,"Arsenal are flying high in both the Premier League and the Champions League, with Mikel Arteta's side looking set to challenge for both trophies this season

Arsenal's season is gathering serious momentum. The Gunners are now favourites to win the Premier League, having surged three points clear at the top of the table after an impressive run of form.

Their dominance has extended to Europe as well, with a commanding 4-0 victory over Atletico Madrid in midweek sealing a perfect start to their Champions League campaign and keeping them joint-top of the group. The emphatic performance was especially encouraging given that Mikel Arteta's side are still yet to fully hit their stride.

Where Arsenal have truly excelled, however, is in defence. With just three league goals conceded after eight games, they are currently on course to break Chelsea's astonishing record of 15 goals against, set in the 2004/05 season.

It's a similar story in Europe, where they have yet to concede a single goal after three Champions League matches - a testament to the organisation and discipline Arteta has instilled in his team. However, it hasn't all been sunshine and rainbows for the Gunners.

The brother of a recently departed Arsenal star has publicly criticised Arteta, while a major obstacle to their title challenge has also been identified. With a home clash against Crystal Palace looming on Sunday, Mirror Football rounds up the latest news from around the Emirates Stadium.

Arteta called out

The brother of former Arsenal midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga has hit out at Arteta for treating his sibling unfairly. Lokonga, 25, left Arsenal permanently in the summer after four years on the club's books, joining Bundesliga club Hamburg in a £250,000 deal.

Lokonga arrived at the Emirates from Anderlecht in 2021, and his future initially looked bright. The Belgian international made 24 appearances in his first season but soon fell out of favour under Arteta and was subsequently sent out on loan to Crystal Palace, Luton Town, and Sevilla.

Lokonga's brother, Paul-Jose M'Poku - who is also a footballer - believes Albert wasn't given a fair shake at Arsenal, even after playing well while out on loan. ""When you look at his performances at Luton Town, Crystal Palace or even Sevilla, he plays like a boss,"" M'Poku, 33, told Voo Sport.

""It's just that he's scored fewer goals. Here at Hamburg, he's scored two goals. But his performances haven't necessarily changed compared to when he was at Arsenal. When you look at his early days at Arsenal, he played some magnificent matches. He plays big games.

""It's just that at a certain point, Mikel Arteta… That's where I sometimes get angry with certain coaches. He wasn't 100 per cent fair to him. Otherwise, when you look at his performances everywhere he's been, he's been successful. But when you score, it makes more noise.""

Like his brother, M'Poku's career also brought him to north London - albeit on the other side of the divide. He joined Tottenham at the age of 16 but, like Lokonga, failed to establish himself and left before making a senior appearance.

Now, M'Poku plays for Saudi Arabian side Al-Batin, having enjoyed a nomadic career that has taken him across Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the UAE, South Korea and Romania. He has also earned 22 caps for the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Haaland roadblock

Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal will win the Premier League this season - but only if they can find a way to stop Erling Haaland. The Manchester City striker looks back to his devastating best, having scored 15 goals in 11 appearances across all competitions so far, including 11 in the league.

Since re-emerging as genuine title contenders in recent seasons, Arsenal have often found themselves undone by City's dominance, driven largely by Haaland's relentless scoring form. Pep Guardiola's side may still be rediscovering their rhythm, but Carragher thinks that if Haaland maintains his current level, City could once again edge Arsenal in the title race.

""Arsenal came into this season worried about Liverpool being the major obstacle to ending a 21-year title wait. Now their biggest fear might be Erling Haaland,"" the Liverpool legend wrote in the Telegraph.

""Where Arsenal have the best squad among the contenders and Liverpool must fix well-documented issues, Manchester City have the most influential player and dynamic attacker. The Norwegian is the biggest reason why Pep Guardiola's side have a great chance of reclaiming their crown. Without him, City’s most realistic target would be finishing in the top four.

""Haaland is so good he can be the difference every time he plays. He is the most lethal finisher of this generation, which is why he is already worthy of comparison with past legends.""

City currently sit second, breathing down Arsenal's neck as they look to reclaim the title that has rarely left the Etihad Stadium over the past decade. Back-to-back defeats to Tottenham and Brighton in August hinted at lingering issues from last season, but Guardiola's men have since bounced back, winning seven of their last nine games in all competitions.

Arsenal will still back themselves as favourites, but with Haaland in this kind of form, nothing can be taken for granted.",Mirror,2025-10-25T03:00:00Z,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-news-mikel-arteta-haaland-36127551,0.4,2025-10-25 13:55:28.057382,,0.2392156862745098

A significant uptick in new ETF launches has some investors on edge, with Citigroup U.S. Equity Strategist Drew Pettit telling Reuters that the launches are at an ""unsustainable level"" that can result in ""product rationalization and closures.""

ETFs have become a fan favorite among many stock investors who want a simplified way to enter financial markets, but the growing ETF market can lead to trouble in the overall stock market.

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

An ETF Market Crash Mostly Hurts ETFs

The growth in ETFs has resulted in more competition, and that creates the stage for many closures. Investors only have so much money to go around, and since smaller ETFs tend to have higher expense ratios, it gives investors less of an incentive to give new funds a chance.

An ETF issuer must publicly announce the fund's closing date a few weeks in advance, giving investors enough time to exit. Then, the fund delists, liquidates its assets, and distributes cash proceeds to remaining shareholders based on their share of the ETF's net asset value. This is a taxable event for shareholders.

The closure of a single ETF won't do much harm to the stock market. If many ETFs shut down, high liquidation can lead to lower stock prices, but investors will receive their money and can simply invest in a similar ETF or buy individual shares of their favorite companies.

If a big ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) shut down, it would be a significant liquidity event since it has more than $1 trillion in net assets. However, an ETF with $100 million in assets won't create as much of a stir if it gets discontinued.

The Concentration Of Money May Hurt The Stock Market

ETFs can become problematic for the stock market if large funds experience significant outflows. Outflows occur when the amount of investor capital that exits a fund exceeds the amount of capital that enters the fund.

If investors panic during a downward market, such as when President Donald Trump went on a tariff spree at the start of his second term, the downward pressure of ETF sellers can hurt the stock market.

ETFs can also hurt the stock market by making equities overvalued. For instance, many of the top ETFs follow a benchmark like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite, which weigh companies by their market caps.",Yahoo!

VOO,Starting With Just $500? Here's the Simplest Way to Build a Multimillion-Dollar Portfolio.,,"The secret to building a $3 million portfolio, even starting with as little as $500, is actually a lot easier than it seems. You don't need to find the next big artificial intelligence (AI) stock, or even perfectly time the market. The simplest way to reach a multimillion-dollar portfolio is by using a disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategy and sticking with it through thick and thin. It's not flashy but it works, and it is best used with exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Dollar-cost averaging is a simple but highly effective strategy and one of the best ways to build wealth over the long run. Instead of guessing when to buy, you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, like $500 a month, no matter how the stock market is performing. Over the years, this smooths out your cost basis and helps protect you from big market swings. More importantly, it keeps you invested through both the good times and the bad.

If you start early, even small amounts can grow into big sums of money. A $500 monthly investment compounded at a 15% annual return can grow to nearly $3 million over 30 years and be worth approximately $11.5 million in 40 years. If you can invest $1,000 instead, you'd have more than $5.5 million at the end of 30 years and about $23 million at the end of 40 years.

The math is simple but powerful. Time is the biggest advantage individual investors have, and the earlier you begin, the easier it becomes to build lasting wealth. Meanwhile, trying to wait for the perfect entry point almost always costs investors more in missed gains than it saves them in avoiding pullbacks.

The best part is you don't need to pick individual stocks or try to outsmart Wall Street. That's what makes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO +0.83%) such a great investment vehicle to pair with this approach.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF mirrors the S&P 500 index, which consists of roughly 500 of the largest and most successful companies in the U.S. With an investment in the ETF you get an instant portfolio made up of top stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.

The S&P 500 is a market-cap weighted index, which means the largest companies by market capitalization (share prices multiplied by shares outstanding) represent a larger percentage of the index. It is one of the biggest reasons why the S&P 500 delivered such strong long-term results over the long term. When a company grows in value, its weight in the index rises, which means the index automatically holds more of the best performers. Meanwhile, companies that underperform gradually become smaller parts of the index or fall out altogether.

A J.P. Morgan study found that between 1980 and 2020, more than 40% of stocks in the Russell 3000 fell at least 70% from their highs and never recovered, yet the overall market delivered strong returns because a handful of mega-winners drove most of the gains. That's what makes this ETF such an ideal foundation for long-term investors. It's not only diversified and low cost, but its structure mirrors the Darwinian nature of the market. The strongest companies thrive and take up a larger share of the fund over time, while weaker ones fade away.

Since its inception in 2010, the Vanguard S&P 500 produced an average annual return of 14.9%, while over the past decade, it generated a 15.3% return. So the 15% average annual return I used in my above example isn't some pie-in-the-sky return, it's what the S&P 500 has been returning on average over the past 10 to 15 years.

VOO,"Masika Kalysha Reveals Her $1,000 Investment Blueprint For Building Wealth | Celebrity Insider",,"Instagram/@masikakalysha

Masika Kalysha, the flashy ‘bad bitch’ of the stock market, has just come up with a luxurious investment plan for beginners who wish to raise their first $1,000. The financial influencer and the head of Stock Market Tips From A Bad Bitch showed her exact portfolio allocation, which is meant to grow long-term wealth, freedom, and the so-called ‘soft life luxury’ she talks about without the need for any trust funds or previous financial knowledge.

Through a video that is both a fun source and a classroom, Kalysha divides her method into three different categories. Kalysha recommends that the investors put 40% of their money, which is $400, into Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) such as VOO, VTI, SPY, QQQ, and SCHD. In her view, these are the foundation of every strong portfolio as they give the investors quick access to the top companies with the smallest amount of work. “You are in fact feeding your cash into the best companies in America without doing anything,” she clears up.

The next 30% or $300 is allocated to what Kalysha refers to as “the future,” which means stocks of AI and robotics companies. Kalysha is very hopeful about stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD, and she even gets a little extreme claiming that AI is not just a trend but rather a total revolution. She indicates that she has made a lot from Nvidia stocks and calls options, and she gives the same to the industry as huge growth potential. The other 30% goes to the tech giants as well as the energy superstars such as Apple and Tesla, alongside the dividend stocks like Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble that are universally considered secure and trustworthy. Kalysha says that this split, in fact, gives access to the best of both worlds and thus creates passive income through the stockholders.

Kalysha quite openly states that this is not professional financial advice, but rather the exact strategy she would apply for her use. She used to use these principles only for a seven-figure portfolio, which she gradually built up through these concepts. It’s about empowering people; you don’t need to know anyone on Wall Street or have a finance degree to start making money – just a plan and a smartphone will do. To make it even easier for her followers, she gives away a free link for opening a Robinhood account with a bonus of five dollars for those who write ‘START’ in a comment on her post, thereby, making it even easier for her followers to enter her world.

The response that she received was overwhelmingly positive, and in fact, many people were expressing their gratitude to her for being sincere and giving such low-cost advice. One follower, who was more of a customer than a user, said, “@masikakalysha is the real deal, I bought her bundle, and it did NOT disappoint.” Testimonials like these serve as reminders of her credibility and the practical value her followers see in her advice. Another commenter has merely suggested that she “check your inbox,” denoting the high degree of interaction and direct communication that she has with her community.

Kalysha’s technique makes the difficult to approach territory of stock trading less complicated. She makes it clear, using slang and her nearly comic, very powerful voice, which attracts a young crowd. She also states the necessity of diversifying—combining stable ETFs with higher-risk but probably rewarding AI stocks and dividend-paying stocks. This creates a portfolio that seeks both safety and daring growth. By revealing her personal blueprint, the Kalysha is not only demonstrating but rather leading the new affluent class into her world of money regardless of the number of transactions it will require. The last thing she said was very uplifting: “You don’t have to be rich to start investing. You invest to be rich.

VOO,One teen girl's journey from broken family to hopeful future - Mission Network News,,"Burkina Faso (MNN) — Marina is a teen girl from a broken home living in Burkina Faso, a broken country. It sounds like a hopeless start, but God!

Marina is one of 23 siblings — her father has four wives, and was known as a harsh, distant man.

Although Burkina Faso is largely Muslim, Marina’s mother heard the Gospel at a local church and began following Jesus. Eventually, her father did too, and the family dynamic has changed.

Greg Yoder with Christian World Outreach (CWO) says, today, the ministry is holistically supporting Marina’s faith and future through the Village of Opportunity (VOO).

“Marina is now a sewing student at the Village of Opportunity and excited about growing in her faith, learning a trade… and her whole family is just excited about the possibilities that come from that.”

At the VOO, students gain more than a career start. “Community is very big at the Village of Opportunity,” says Yoder. “Our leaders there treat these girls like their family.”

For Marina, the community aspect is crucial since she is also grieving the loss of a dear friend. At the VOO, Marina sees the Body of Christ at work.

“She’s got the support of our staff, but also the other young ladies that attend the vocational school there. They encourage each other [and] they grow together in their faith,” says Yoder.

“Our hope is that they (students) will go back to their villages and make a difference and share what they’ve learned, but also share about Jesus and share the Gospel with the people around them.”

Pray for Marina and her classmates as they train, grow, and shine Christ’s light in Burkina Faso.

“If God calls you to give financially to support this ministry, costs have gone up for the food and things that we need to minister to these young ladies. We appreciate God’s people coming together and doing that.”

VOO,"1 Top Vanguard Fund That Could Turn $17,000 Into $1 Million",,"Key Points

This popular ETF tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, providing exposure to all sectors of the economy.

If trailing 10-year returns repeat in the future, investors will see their starting capital outlays soar over time.

Many factors can impact stock market returns, like interest rates, economic growth, and capital flows.

10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›

We all want to allocate capital like Warren Buffett. But investors don't always need to pick individual stocks to be successful in the stock market. It's totally fine to go the passive route, opting to choose exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for your portfolio. This is still a smart way to generate long-term wealth.

Vanguard is a well-known asset management firm that has many of these products for investors to pick from. And they can put up some serious returns. Take a look at this top Vanguard ETF that could turn $17,000 into $1 million.

You need to know what you own

Investors should take a closer look at the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). As the name suggests, it tracks the performance of the overall S&P 500. This widely followed index contains 500 large and profitable U.S.-based companies. It's essentially a way to assess the performance of the U.S. economy. And investors who own this ETF are betting on ongoing American innovation. This has historically been a smart view to have, as the U.S. is by far the most dominant economy.

This ETF owns 500 different stocks. However, it's weighted by market cap, so there is some concentration to be mindful of. It shouldn't be surprising that technology companies have a higher weight. The top three positions in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The share prices of these companies have performed well in the past decade, which has lifted up the entire ETF.

Generally speaking, though, investors do gain broad exposure to all sectors of the economy. Tech stocks feature prominently, which means an inherent bet on trends like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, digital advertising, and streaming entertainment. However, companies in financial services, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors, for instance, are also in the ETF.

This ETF's performance is off the charts

In the last decade, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has generated a total return of 290% (as of Oct. 17). This translates to a phenomenal annualized gain of 14.6%. Assuming this performance continues over the next three decades, this ETF will be able to turn a starting investment of $17,000 into $1 million by 2055. It's difficult to argue about this type of fantastic result.

The investment management industry is interesting because customers often pay for products that underperform the S&P 500. Data shows that the vast majority of so-called experts, active fund managers who are known to charge exorbitant fees, put up returns that lag the popular benchmark. That seems like an unacceptable value proposition.

Despite its strong performance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is an inexpensive investment vehicle. Its expense ratio of 0.03% means that on a hypothetical $1,000 investment, investors would only pay $0.30 for the fee on an annual basis.

The future could look different from the past

It's important that investors realize that the last 10 years have been an anomaly from a historical perspective. Over the very long term, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of about 10% per year. If this is what ends up happening in the future, then it will undoubtedly take investors a lot longer to turn $17,000 into $1 million.

No one has any idea what forward returns will look like. They could revert back to their historical average. Or they could mimic what we saw over the past decade. It's impossible to predict what will happen.

Recent trends don't seem like they will slow by much, though. The Federal Reserve is starting to lower interest rates, which can be a boon for the economy. Money continues to flow into the stock market via passive investment vehicles, demand that drives up stock prices. And technology companies are likely to continue dominating, commanding a greater share of the stock market's capitalization.

Regardless of what the next decade holds, investors who put money to work early and with a long-term mindset should be rewarded.

VOO,1 Heavily Diversified Vanguard ETF That Could Outperform the S&P 500 in 2026 | The Motley Fool,,"Let's be clear. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO +0.83%) is an excellent long-term investment vehicle, and so are other low-cost S&P 500 ETFs. Even if you buy at an all-time high, history shows that the S&P 500 is still a great wealth-building tool for investors who measure their returns in decades.

However, there are some major drawbacks of the S&P 500 that investors should be aware of. For one thing, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated. It is a weighted index, meaning that larger companies make up more of its assets, and the rise of trillion-dollar tech companies has resulted in a top-heavy index. As its name suggests, there are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but the 10 largest make up more than 40% of an S&P 500 index fund's assets.

There's also the more subtle issue that S&P 500 index funds are designed to match the performance of the market, not to outperform it. If your goal is to beat the market, by definition, you'll have to look elsewhere.

If it is indeed your goal to beat the market, one Vanguard ETF you may want to take a closer look at is the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (VTWO +1.26%). Not only does it solve the ""lack of diversification"" problem of the S&P 500, but there are some good reasons why it could be a great time to invest in this index.

The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF in a nutshell

If you aren't familiar with the Russell 2000 index, it's the most widely used benchmark for small-cap stocks. As the name suggests, it is an index that tracks the stocks of 2,000 companies. The median market cap of a Russell 2000 component is about $3.3 billion, and just to name the extremes, the largest Russell 2000 stock right now is Credo Technology (CRDO +3.03%) with a $23.4 billion market cap, and the smallest components have market caps in the $150 million range.

To be sure, the Russell 2000 is a weighted index like the S&P 500. But because of the tighter range of market caps (the largest S&P 500 stock has a market cap about 110 times the median), as well as the fact that it has 2,000 stocks, no component of the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF makes up more than 0.75% of the fund's assets. In short, it's a far more diversified ETF than the S&P 500.

Like most Vanguard products, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has a minimal expense ratio of 0.07%. This means for every $1,000 you have invested in the fund, your annualized investment expense is just $0.70. (This isn't a fee you have to pay -- it will simply be reflected in the fund's performance over time.)

Why buy the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF now?

It's a losing battle to try to precisely time the market. I have no idea whether the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF will beat the S&P over the next few weeks or months.

Having said that, from a long-term investor's perspective, it looks like an excellent entry point into small caps.

For one thing, the valuation gap between large-cap and small-cap stocks hasn't been this wide since the 1990s. To illustrate this, consider that the average S&P 500 stock trades for 29 times earnings and for 5.2 times book value right now. The average Russell 2000 component has a P/E ratio of 18.3 and trades for just 2 times book value. The last time the gap was this wide, small caps proceeded to outperform large caps for more than a decade.

There could also be some excellent catalysts that favor small caps over the next few years, especially the expected drop in interest rates. One big reason is that small caps are generally more debt-reliant than larger companies, and lower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs. The generally loose-regulation nature of the current administration could also help small caps compete more effectively with their larger counterparts.

The bottom line is that the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF isn't going to double or triple your money quickly. But it could be an excellent way to build wealth over time, and that's especially true for those who buy while the valuation gap is still so wide.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-23T13:24:17Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/23/1-heavily-diversified-vanguard-etf-that-could-outp/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:56:29.962759,,0.2156862745098038

VOO,What I Wish I Knew Before Buying My First Stock (and How You Can Avoid the Same Mistake) | The Motley Fool,,"As someone who didn't grow up with financially savvy parents or financial mentors, I saw investing as something reserved for people who had lots of money, or who were very knowledgeable about how the stock market works. I thought it required spending tons of time researching companies, looking through financial statements, and being glued to investing programs on CNBC.

However, my assumptions couldn't be further from the truth. By no means are any of those activities required to be a good investor. In fact, they can be counterproductive when they cause you to chase ""the next big thing,"" second-guess yourself, or just succumb to information overload.

One thing I wish I had known before buying my first stock is how efficient investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be, and how much effort it removes.

What exactly are ETFs?

An ETF is a collection of different stocks packaged together into one fund, allowing you to instantly invest in all of the companies at once. Think about it like this: Instead of going to a grocery store and picking out individual items to put into your basket, you can buy the basket already prefilled, saving you time and effort.

In many cases, an ETF is weighted by market cap, so larger companies in the ETF will receive more of your investment than smaller ones. For example, if Company A accounts for 10% of an ETF, and Company B accounts for 1%, investing $1,000 in the ETF would mean $100 going into Company A's shares, and $10 going into Company B's.

What are the advantages of investing in ETFs?

The main advantage of investing in ETFs is that you get instant diversification, generally with a single investment. Instead of investing in dozens (or even hundreds) of individual companies to achieve diversification, you could invest in just one ETF that accomplishes all that for you. This saves time and effort.

Investing in ETFs also reduces the risks that come with investing in individual companies. The stock market is notoriously irrational; all it takes is a negative headline (justified or not) or unmet short-term expectations for a company's shares to drop.

In an ETF, even with one stock (or a few stocks) down, you have others that can pick up the slack and help balance things out. ETFs aren't immune to volatility, but they're often much steadier than an individual stock.

What ETF makes a good first investment?

There are thousands of ETFs to choose from, but one that stands out for first-time investors is an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO +0.83%). When you invest in this ETF, you get instant exposure to around 500 of the largest and most influential companies in America. Notable names in the ETF include Apple, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, and plenty of other household names.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has become concentrated in tech stocks (34.8% of the ETF) due to the significant increase in their valuations in recent years, but it still contains companies from all major sectors. You'll have access to companies in the healthcare, energy, consumer discretionary, industrial, real estate, and other sectors of the economy.

It's not just me who's a fan of investing in the S&P 500, either. Famed investor Warren Buffett has said for decades that consistently investing in an S&P 500 ETF makes the most sense for the average investor. And the best way to do so is through dollar-cost averaging.

When you dollar-cost average, you set a specific amount and a specific time to make investments, and follow your schedule regardless of what stock prices are at that time. It could be investing $100 every Monday, investing $250 every other Friday, investing $500 at the beginning of each month, or whatever makes the most sense for your financial situation.

You'll buy fewer shares when prices are higher, and more when they're lower. What matters most is that you remain consistent and trust that the process will pay off long-term -- which it typically does.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-22T11:45:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/22/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-buying-my-first-stock/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:56:45.571751,,0.1607843137254903
VOO,SPCA Sandakan condemns beating death of puppy,,"SANDAKAN, Oct 22 — Sandakan SPCA expressed deep distress over the case of a puppy that was beaten to death at Mile 6, here, on September 24.

“The puppy, believed to be under six months old, was reportedly beaten to death by an individual who has since admitted to the act in a video recording,” said the society’s Secretary Gin Voo in a statement, Tuesday.

According to information gathered by Sandakan-based animal welfare group, two eyewitnesses came forward with video evidence showing the individual openly confessing to killing the puppy, stating that he acted alone and was not instructed by anyone else.

In response, Sandakan SPCA has lodged an official police report, and the case is now under investigation by the Sandakan Police Department, led by a Sergeant overseeing the proceedings. A report has also been submitted to the Sabah Veterinary Department.

Under the Animal Welfare Act 2015, causing unnecessary suffering or death to an animal is an offence punishable by law. Sandakan SPCA emphasises that such cruel behaviour has no place in a compassionate society.

“We are heartbroken that acts of violence against innocent animals continue to occur,” Gin said.

“We urge the authorities to take appropriate action to ensure justice is served. It is our collective responsibility to protect those who cannot speak for themselves.”

Sandakan SPCA acknowledged the courage of the witnesses who stepped forward and provided the crucial evidence.

The organisation continues to monitor the case closely and will assist the authorities throughout the investigation. — Daily Express",Malay Mail,2025-10-22T06:48:06Z,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2025/10/22/spca-sandakan-condemns-beating-death-of-puppy/195538,0.4,2025-10-25 13:56:53.378198,,-0.3411764705882353

Company overview

Company snapshot

Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) provides investors with access to developed and emerging equity markets outside the United States. Its low-cost and passive approach as well as its broad diversification make it a core holding for global asset allocation strategies.

The Stock's product offers broad international equity exposure outside the United States through a single ETF.

Its business model revolves around passively tracking the FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index using a full replication approach. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF's customer base ranges from individual and institutional investors seeking diversified international stock market exposure.

Foolish take

Global balance often goes unnoticed until investors realize how concentrated their portfolio are in U.S stocks. The recent increase in Gleason Group's stake in Vanguard Total International Stock ETF shows that even large U.S allocators are looking overseas again.

Vanguard Total International Stock ETF holds more than 7000 International stocks from over 40 countries, offering investors exposure to companies and currencies beyond the S&P 500. Europe and Japan make up its largest weightings, while emerging markets add long-term growth potential at lower valuations. The fund's dividend yield of 2.74 percent provides income that can help offset currency swings, and its broader diversification spreads risks across sectors and economies.

Owning global equities through low-cost funds such as VXUS gives portfolios new sources of return and offers long-term opportunity for investors beyond the U.S market. With U.S equity valuations still near historic highs, global funds like VXUS offer both balance and breathing room within a portfolio.

Because some tech companies have seen their market caps rise to remarkable levels due to the AI boom, the value of this ETF has gotten much more concentrated in its largest positions than it used to be. However, it still contains leading companies from every major sector. There's JPMorgan Chase and Visa in the financial sector; ExxonMobil and Chevron in the energy sector; Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson in the healthcare sector; Amazon and Tesla in the consumer discretionary sector; Walmart and Coca-Cola in the consumer staples sector; and plenty of others.

The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will inevitably experience volatility (like any other stock or ETF), but it has been a great long-term investment, averaging annualized returns of more than 12.7% since it hit the market in September 2010.

Within SPY’s holdings, Technology, Communication Services, and Utilities sectors posted gains today, while the Energy and Consumer Staples sectors declined.

Importantly, SPY closely tracks the S&P 500 Index (SPX), which also ended 0.8% higher. Further, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) gained 1.04%.

What Impacted the Market Today?

The market got a boost after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for September came in lower than anticipated, raising hopes for Fed interest rate cuts later this year. Also, strong results from major S&P 500 companies contributed to the positive market sentiment.

Historically, the end of October often sees an upward trend in stock prices. This is due to institutional investors buying stocks with excess cash as they close their fiscal year.

Looking ahead, the Fed’s upcoming October 28-29 meeting and the potential impact of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown could trigger volatility in the SPY ETF.

Fund Flows and Sentiment

SPY’s 5-day net outflows totaled $2 billion, showing that investors pulled capital from SPY over the past five trading days. Meanwhile, its three-month average trading volume is 73.83 million shares.

It must be noted that retail sentiment remains neutral, while hedge fund managers increased their holdings of the SPY ETF in the last quarter.

SPY’s Price Forecasts and Holdings

According to TipRanks’ unique ETF analyst consensus, which is based on a weighted average of analyst ratings on its holdings, SPY is a Moderate Buy. The Street’s average price target of $752.25 for the SPY ETF implies an upside potential of 11.07%.

Currently, SPY’s five holdings with the highest upside potential are Moderna (MRNA), Charter Communications (CHTR), News Corporation (NWSA), MGM Resorts (MGM), and GoDaddy (GDDY).

Meanwhile, its five holdings with the greatest downside potential are Intel, Paramount Skydance (PSKY), Tesla (TSLA), Palantir (PLTR), and Garmin (GRMN).

SPY,"New Nissan MPV spotted testing in India, May launch soon",,"Nissan is preparing to launch a new MPV based on the Renault Triber in India soon. Ahead of official confirmation, the Renault Triber based MPV has been spotted testing for the first time in the Indian roads. The test mule has revealed some information about it’s exterior design as well some of it’s features. Nissan is expected to launch the rumoured MPV by the end of this year or in early 2026.

Just like the Kiger and Magnite, the upcoming MPV is said to be another badge-engineered product between Renault and Nissan. The spy shots has suggested the upcoming MPV will have a Triber like silhouette.

New Nissan MPV exterior and interior (expectations)

The test mule was seen in a heavily camouflaged state. However, the spy shots has revealed that the Nissan MPV will have a different fascia with a larger grille that sports hexagonal inserts. The MPV will feature a different pair of headlamps compared to those on the Triber. On the front bumper, the MPV gets new C-shaped accents. It rides on newly designed wheels. The MPV gets functional roof rails. Though the spy shots don’t reveal the rear design of the MPV, it is expected to receive some tweaks as well.

We haven’t got a sighting of the interior yet, but as the MPV shares a lot with the Triber, expect a similar interior and feature list here as well. Some interior bits will receive the Nissan treatment to show distinction from its Renault cousin. Expected features include a 7-inch TFT instrument display, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless charging pad, a cooled central storage box, and sliding and reclining second-row seats. Like the Triber, expect the three-row modular seating configuration to be carried forward as well.

New Nissan MPV engine, specs

The Nissan MPV will be powered by a 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine producing 72hp and 96Nm of torque, mated to either a 5-speed manual or AMT transmission—the same powertrain used in the Triber.

Upon launch, this Nissan MPV will only be the second sub-compact MPV in the market alongside the Renault Triber, offering a flexibility of 7-seats in an economical package. Prices will be announced in the first quarter of 2026, and they can be expected to be similar to the Triber. For reference, the Triber is priced between Rs 5.76 lakh and Rs 8.38 lakh (ex-showroom).",KalingaTV,2025-10-25T05:00:43Z,https://kalingatv.com/business/new-nissan-mpv-spotted-testing-in-india-may-launch-soon/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:57:09.201379,,0.0980392156862746

Yet, Aditya Chopra is not letting the setback slow him down. Instead, he’s re-strategizing with renewed focus. The next chapter, Alpha led by Alia Bhatt and Sharvari, and also starring Bobby Deol and Anil Kapoor, is already shaping up to be crucial in reviving momentum. Sources have confirmed that Hrithik Roshan will make a special appearance as Agent Kabir in the film.

EXCLUSIVE: Aditya Chopra dials Shah Rukh Khan for Alpha cameo – wants Pathaan to reignite Spy Universe!

However, the War 2 debacle has taken a toll on the impact of cameo in Alpha, and hence, sources inform that Aditya Chopra has picked up the call on Shah Rukh Khan, requesting him to make a cameo appearance in Alpha. A source told Bollywood Hugama, ""At the moment, Pathaan is the most talked about character of the Spy Universe. Aditya Chopra has picked up the call on Shah Rukh Khan to make a cameo in Alpha. He has designed a special part for him, which leads to Pathaan 2. Shah Rukh Khan has asked for some time to think over the same, as he has allotted bulk dates to King at the moment.""

Aditya Chopra has requested 3 to 4 shoot days in early November, as Alpha is gearing up for a Christmas 2025 release. ""Shah Rukh Khan had blocked the entire November for the shoot of King, but at the request of Adi, he is trying to reschedule the commitment to make his cameo in Alpha a reality. He will confirm his presence in a week to 10 days. If not a proper cameo, he might just shoot for an end-credit sequence of Alpha."" Adi is also trying to crack a cameo for Salman Khan as Tiger in Alpha, but the writing is yet to be completed. ""He will approach Salman only when the cameo's impact is as good as the one for Tiger in Pathaan had.""

Alpha is directed by Shiv Ravail and is set for a Christmas 2025 release.

SPY,Top Democrats Demand Details of Spy Agencies' Role in Boat Strikes,,"The top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees demanded details of U.S. spy agencies’ role in lethal attacks on drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, complaining in a letter Friday to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that they have received “virtually no information” on the topic since the strikes began, despite repeated requests.

In the letter, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Connecticut) and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Virginia) questioned whether lawyers at U.S. spy agencies have weighed in on the legality of the attacks, which critics say violate U.S. and international law.

“To the extent that [intelligence] personnel are assisting DOD activities in this space, they must do so knowing that they are supporting legally authorized operations,” the pair wrote to Gabbard, referring to intelligence support on Pentagon-conducted strikes.

Little is known publicly about the role of the CIA and its sister agencies in the 10 strikes, which are conducted by U.S. Special Operations forces on boats the Trump administration says are ferrying drugs for narcotics traffickers. Various spy agencies are contributing intelligence, according to current and former U.S. officials.

The publicly disclosed attacks have killed at least 40 people, according to the administration. The operations, which began in the Caribbean in early September, expanded this week to the eastern Pacific.

CIA personnel are part of a Pentagon-led group tracking drug boats in the Caribbean but are not involved in decisions about which targets are to be struck, said two former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.

President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, escalating the pressure on President Nicolás Maduro amid a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean.

Himes and Warner said the congressional intelligence committees, which are supposed to keep tabs on secretive spy agencies, have not been given information on key topics. That includes which agencies are providing support for the boat strikes, how many resources and personnel are dedicated to the topic, and whether they are collecting and analyzing intelligence in the strikes’ aftermath to determine the type and quantity of drugs that may have been aboard the boats.

“This is a clear violation of the legal obligation to keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed,” they wrote.

Gabbard’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has suggested repeatedly in recent days that he may order armed strikes on land-based targets within Venezuela. He has sent conflicting signals about whether he would first notify Congress or seek its approval.

On Thursday, he appeared to rule out seeking approval for future military action. “I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he told reporters. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country.”

He did say he would notify Congress before undertaking any operations on land. “We’re going to tell them what we’re going to do and I think they’ll probably like it, except for the radical left lunatics,” Trump said.

Trump has claimed the authority to conduct drug strikes, notifying Congress that the United States is engaged in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels that it has designated as terrorist organizations and that pose a national security threat.

The White House has declined to release – or so far share with Congress – an opinion by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel that the administration says provides legal justification for the strikes.

Earlier this month, a senior Pentagon lawyer nominated to be the Army general counsel, Charles L. Young, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the opinion was written by a “working group” of lawyers from the CIA, White House, Pentagon and State departments. He told the lawmakers it was not in his “discretion” to release it, and only the president could do so.

In an interview, Himes said he had not heard directly from CIA officials about any legal concerns. “I personally have extreme misgivings in the absence of any facts or arguments from the administration,” he said.

The lawmakers’ letter comes amid questions about the extent to which military and intelligence operators, or lawyers and commanders involved in the strikes, could have any legal exposure. One aide to a Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told The Washington Post that committee staff have been “hearing from inside the Pentagon that individuals have been raising liability issues.”

Some junior officers have asked military lawyers, known as judge advocates general or JAGs, for written sign-off before taking part in strikes, said two people familiar with the matter. It does not appear that such memos were furnished, said one of the people.

Todd Huntley, a former Navy JAG who heads the National Security Law program at Georgetown University, said those most exposed legally from a practical standpoint are probably military commanders or civilians in the chain of command who have approved strikes or targets and might be named in a prosecution brought in another country.

Another national security law expert, Mark Nevitt, an associate law professor at Emory University and a former Navy JAG, said international criminal prosecution is “highly, highly unlikely.” He pointed out that the U.S. is not a party to the International Criminal Court, and while some countries could try to bring charges under their domestic laws, they are not likely to succeed.

Congress, Nevitt said, must push back “forcefully on illegal orders” and make clear that the president cannot treat criminal suspects as combatants.

The concerns about the strikes’ legality are compounded by the fact that career military and civilian lawyers in the Defense Department and lawyers at other agencies who might otherwise be involved in the deliberations have left government or been excluded from the discussions. At the White House, the entire National Security Council legal team – about half a dozen lawyers – has been emptied out as personnel ended their assignments and they were not replaced.

They include Paul Ney Jr., a former Pentagon general counsel who served briefly as NSC legal adviser and was let go in a mass purge in May as part of an effort to downsize the NSC. Lawyers at the NSC, State Department, Justice Department and the Pentagon earlier this year questioned the legal basis for military strikes on cartels without authorization from Congress, and for a while were able to forestall action, according to several people familiar with the matter.",japannews.yomiuri.co.jp,2025-10-25T03:08:46Z,https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/news-services/washingtonpost/20251025-288534/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:58:35.162131,,-0.06666666666666665
SPY,Top Democrats demand details of spy agencies' role in boat strikes,,"The top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees demanded details of U.S. spy agencies’ role in lethal attacks on drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, complaining in a letter Friday to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that they have received “virtually no information” on the topic since the strikes began, despite repeated requests.

In the letter, Rep. Jim Himes ,D-Conn., and Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-V a., questioned whether lawyers at U.S. spy agencies have weighed in on the legality of the attacks, which critics say violate U.S. and international law.

“To the extent that (intelligence)personnel are assisting DOD activities in this space, they must do so knowing that they are supporting legally authorized operations,” the pair wrote to Gabbard, referring to intelligence support on Pentagon-conducted strikes.

Little is known publicly about the role of the CIA and its sister agencies in the 10 strikes, which are conducted by U.S. Special Operations forces on boats the Trump administration says are ferrying drugs for narcotics traffickers. Various spy agencies are contributing intelligence, according to current and former U.S. officials.

The publicly disclosed attacks have killed at least 40 people, according to the administration. The operations, which began in the Caribbean in early September, expanded this week to the eastern Pacific.

CIA personnel are part of a Pentagon-led group tracking drug boats in the Caribbean but are not involved in decisions about which targets are to be struck, said two former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.

President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, escalating the pressure on President Nicolás Maduro amid a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean.

Himes and Warner said the congressional intelligence committees, which are supposed to keep tabs on secretive spy agencies, have not been given information on key topics. That includes which agencies are providing support for the boat strikes, how many resources and personnel are dedicated to the topic, and whether they are collecting and analyzing intelligence in the strikes’ aftermath to determine the type and quantity of drugs that may have been aboard the boats.

“This is a clear violation of the legal obligation to keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed,” they wrote.

Gabbard’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SPY,Canada's Carney government attacks basic democratic rights as it seeks deal with America's would-be dictator Trump,,"Canada’s federal government under former Goldman Sachs executive and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is pushing forward with two bills containing sweeping attacks on democratic rights and immigrants. Elected on a wave of popular revulsion to the fascist spectacle of Trump’s first three months in office, Carney has repudiated the cynical pose of opposition to Trump he struck for the cameras during the campaign.

Groveling before the aspiring fascist dictator in the Oval Office earlier this month, Carney praised Trump as a “transformative president.” A similar “transformation” of Canadian social relations is underway—from bourgeois democracy to authoritarian police state.

The Carney government’s first substantive piece of legislation after April’s election was the so-called “Strong Borders Act” Bill C-2, an omnibus bill amending multiple existing laws. The bill combines a sweeping power grab for the police, spy agencies and Cabinet together with a full-frontal attack on immigrants and refugees. Since its introduction in June, the bill has provoked widespread opposition, with multiple campaigns for its repeal from initiated by the Migrant Rights Network, Green Peace and other refugee-support, civil rights and internet privacy groups.

The government has been forced to change tack due to the posturing by the opposition Conservatives and New Democrats as opponents of Bill C-2, at least in its current form. On October 8, Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree tabled a new bill, C-12, containing only the attacks on the rights of refugee-claimants and immigrants, with the aim of adopting them as quickly as possible. Underscoring that the Liberals still intend to implement the new spying and police powers, they left the remainder of Bill C-2 on the legislative agenda. On October 11, he declared that the police spying measures would not be abandoned but rather introduced separately, after being “refined” to eliminate “overreach.”

The Carney government proposes to give the police and Canadian spy agencies sweeping powers to eavesdrop on private communications, forcibly enlist doctors, accountants and other providers of “services” as state informants, and force postal workers to open private mail—all without a warrant. In a series of attacks on the rights of immigrants and refugees, it creates the legal basis for a regime of mass deportation.

There is no mass support for any of these measures. The government did not win an election on attacking immigrant rights or on expanded police powers, nor could it have. They won an election by posturing as opponents of the man whose playbook they are moving to adopt ever more completely: Donald Trump.

The legislation cannot be understood apart from the deepening inter-imperialist competition between Canada and the United States, the escalating crisis of world capitalism, and the Canadian bourgeoisie’s effort to accommodate itself to the fascist in the White House. The Trump regime has whipped up hysteria about the supposed “insecurity” of the Canada-US border, advancing its fraudulent claims that fentanyl and “illegal migrants” are flowing from Canada to the USA in order to justify after the fact its decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods. Bill C-2 was ostensibly introduced in order to appease these entirely concocted “concerns” and assist the government’s ongoing efforts to negotiate tariff-free access to US markets for Canadian business.

At the same time, the Canadian ruling class, like its US counterpart, recognizes that the greatest threat to its interests comes from below—from the working class entering into mass and revolutionary struggle against moribund capitalism—which is why it is determined to strengthen the powers of state repression.

Workers must be repressed in any event in order to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars from social spending to war and “infrastructure investments” under Carney’s upcoming fall budget. In a televised address to the nation Wednesday evening, the Prime Minister made clear it would include crushing social austerity to fund corporate handouts and massive increases in military expenditures to prepare for world war. As in the United States, Canada’s ruling class is seeking to pre-empt the inevitable wave of working class opposition with state repression.

Already the Liberal government has moved to effectively abolish the right to strike, using a newly concocted “reinterpretation of Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code, to illegalize strikes by railway, port, and Canada Post workers; and the Quebec government has followed suit, imposing draconian limits on the right to strike in the country’s second most populous province.

But the Carney government knows that it must proceed by degrees. As in the United States, the weakest and most vulnerable sections of the working class will be attacked first. And the most vulnerable sections of the working class include immigrants and refugees.

Bill C-12 contains multiple provisions attacking refugee and immigrant rights. It:

•Significantly limits who can claim refugee status in Canada, including barring refugee claims from anyone who failed to make a claim for refugee status in Canada within one year of their first arrival, retroactive to 2020.

•Further restricts the ability of refugees fleeing to Canada from third countries via the United States to claim refugee status in Canada.

•Requires refugees to claim refugee status upon their first entry to Canada, denying all claims to anyone who had previously entered Canada, for any purpose.

•Grants sweeping power to the Minister of Immigration to cancel individual refugee claims, and to cancel claims en masse, based on criteria such as country of origin, or political affiliation.

Major attacks on privacy and democratic right in Bill C-2 include provisions that would:

•Authorize law enforcement, including Canada Border Services Agency officers, prison guards and “special constables” to make warrantless demands for information about surveillance targets from the providers of digital services, including cell phone companies, internet service providers and social media providers.

•Empowering of state authorities to order Canada Post workers to open private mail without obtaining a warrant.

•Grant CSIS, Canada’s domestic spy agency, and other national security and police agencies warrantless access to the data of individuals, based merely on suspicion that a “law passed by Parliament” had been breached. According to the Globe & Mail, “Police could reach out to doctors, abortion clinics, hotels, rental car companies and other entities and service providers,” who would be obligated to inform on patients and clients, under gag orders not to reveal their informant activities. Those who refuse to collaborate could face stiff penalties or prison.

This sweeping power grab aroused an enormous amount of opposition, of both a principled and opportunistic variety.

The Migrant Rights Network correctly objected that the measures directed against refugees would make the Canadian government complicit in the Trump regime’s witch hunt of immigrants and refugees. “Previously,” they explain, “migrants crossing from the US between official ports could apply for refugee status after 14 days. Bill C-12 removes this completely, trapping vulnerable people under Trump’s xenophobic policies. The sweeping powers granted to the Minister of Immigration to deny refugee and permanent residency claims create the legal basis for Canada to engage in the kind of mass deportations and grotesque abuses of human rights that are ongoing in the United States.

These powers could also conceivably be used to reject political refugees fleeing the savage campaign of state repression which is developing in the United States. Donald Trump has signed a document called “NSPM-7” (National Security Presidential Memorandum) which criminalizes opposition to fascism and designates opposition to capitalism and Christianity as thought-crimes. The journalist Ken Klippenstein has revealed that the FBI is “drawing up lists” of people to be targeted for repression under NSPM-7. It is entirely possible that political opponents of a fascist crackdown by the Trump regime could flee to Canada, as did tens thousands of draft resisters and other American opponents of the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s. The Carney government would be collaborators in their repression.

Internet privacy advocates have pointed out that government’s new requirement that internet service providers and social media outlets create “digital back doors” so as to allow the state rapid access to private subscriber information would leave Canadian workers vulnerable to cyber-crime, including identity theft, fraud, harassment and blackmail. CSIS is already permitted to grant access to information they obtain to the spying agencies of the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, under the so-called “Five Eyes” spy treaty.

These spying measures, for which CSIS and the police have long campaigned, have nothing to do with the government’s latest proffered justification of “border security.” University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist opined to the CBC that the spying powers contained in the bill constitute an effort to “sneak” old provisions from failed legislation into this bill— “about which there’s very little to do with lawful access.”

Geist’s comment points towards the entirely unprincipled nature of the objections to these new spying measures on the part of Canada’s parliamentary opposition. The Liberal’s power-grab has given the Conservatives the stage to pose—entirely fraudulently—as champions of civil rights and privacy. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre cynically declared, “We don’t think that law-abiding Canadians should lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals on borders and immigration.”

The former Conservative Government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper attempted and failed to pass similar spying measures in 2014, on the fraudulent basis that civil rights stood in the way of stopping child pornography. Poilievre voted for those powers.

Further, Poilievre is perfectly content if immigrants should lose their liberty. His Conservatives have been whipping up xenophobia against immigrants and refugees, especially Muslims, equating opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza with “terrorism.” Conservative MP Michelle Rempel-Garner is campaigning to revoke birthright citizenship, in a further attempt to align Canadian policies with those of the fascist Trump regime.

In April’s election, the Conservatives’ defeat, which included Poilievre’s loss of his own parliamentary seat, was bound up with the widespread recognition that the Tories shared Trump’s far-right politics. This includes his warmongering, drive to establish authoritarian forms of rule, and commitment to savage attacks on the working class.

The NDP’s posturing is no less credible. This is a party that propped up the Liberals in parliament for six years as they enforced a massive rearmament program, slashed public spending, and undermined democratic rights. The NDP is sponsored by the trade union bureaucracy, which demonstrates in every workers’ struggle its bitter hostility to the democratic and social rights of workers by imposing concessions and riding roughshod over widespread support for a struggle against capitalist austerity and war.

The Liberal government campaign for vast police powers and against refugees demonstrates that there is no political constituency within the Canadian ruling class for basic democratic rights. As in the United States and in every other country, the only social force which can turn back the tide of reaction and authoritarianism in Canada is the working class, united in struggle with workers in the United States, Mexico and other countries on the basis of a socialist program.",World Socialist,2025-10-24T23:40:58Z,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/10/24/otzt-o24.html,1.0,2025-10-25 13:59:50.129648,,-0.0980392156862745
SPY,"20 Greatest Spy Movies of All Time, Ranked",,"As Buster Bluther once proclaimed, “Alias is a show about a spy,” but what about movies about spies? There are a bunch, it turns out. People like stories about spying, espionage, and surveillance, largely because you throw these kinds of things into a thriller or action movie, and things just naturally get a bit more exciting. The mystery genre, also, is quite frequently tied to spy-related stories.

The following movies are from a whole bunch of different decades, with the earliest film here being one that came out about 100 years ago, and the most recent being from around the halfway point of the 2020s… so, nearly a century later. People have always liked spy movies, and it’s great how spy movies can be so varied, with some being grim and serious, some being action-packed, and some being unsettling and surprising. To qualify here, a movie has to be about a spy, or largely about spies/spying. That might exclude movies more about conspiracies, or movies where only a side character is mentioned to be a spy, but if you get too broad with how you define a “spy movie,” there are just too many options to pick from.

20 'Munich' (2005)

Not that Steven Spielberg had to prove he could make non-sentimental and serious movies in 2005, after more than three decades spent directing a variety of feature films, but still, Munich does stand out for being his darkest and potentially most cynical movie to date. It takes place in the wake of 11 Israeli athletes being kidnapped and murdered by a Palestinian terrorist group during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, with Mossad agents being deployed to find the perpetrators and take them out.

It's a film about a dark chapter in history, and the further dark events that followed it, all playing out across a very tense runtime that nears three hours. But Munich earns its length, and tackles some thought-provoking and continually relevant things, though it’s harder to recommend if you're personally after a spy movie that’s more traditionally entertaining, or one offering some kind of escapism.

19 'The Ipcress File' (1965)

Michael Caine never played the most well-known of all cinematic British spies (his time will come, in this ranking, don’t worry), but he did portray Harry Palmer, who’s a character you might know if you really like spy novels and/or movies. Caine played Palmer a total of five times, but the first movie in what became a series, The Ipcress File, is the best of the bunch.

It’s also a more low-key sort of spy story, compared to that other one whose first movies came out in the 1960s, and came to redefine what spies were, in pop culture. But if you're willing to have a bit more of a slow-burn kind of thing, and a spy film that emphasizes thrills and suspense over action, then The Ipcress File satisfies, with Caine being especially good here (and probably the main reason to watch this one).

18 'Charade' (1963)

Released in a pretty strong year for cinema, Charade is one of the most Hitchcockian films not actually directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Also, yes, like with Mr. Bond, some of Hitchcock’s spy movies will get mentioned here, but not just yet. For now, Charade deserves some praise, especially because it’s a genuinely great comedy – and has a perfect lead actor pairing in Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn – on top of being a fun spy thriller.

In the film, Grant and Hepburn play characters who fall for each other, but then get swept up in a madcap series of events involving dangerous associates of the latter’s dead husband. The pair kind of have to become isolated and amateur sleuths to get to the bottom of whatever’s going on, and everything becomes worth questioning, since everyone’s hard to read. Charade is almost farcical, but not to the point where the thrills get undermined, so it’s an exceptionally well-balanced film, all things considered.

17 'The Professional' (1981)

In The Professional, there’s a super charismatic and proficient Secret Service agent named Joss Beaumont, but he gets betrayed by the people he’s working for early on, and then faces two decades in prison. He says, “Nah, maybe not,” and breaks out before going on a rampage of the one-man army variety, tracking down whoever might be responsible for the betrayal and then getting revenge.

It's kind of nihilistic, and a bit over-the-top at points, but The Professional is also very thrilling and surprisingly action-packed, too, being the kind of film that doesn’t ever really seem keen on slowing down. It also benefits from an Ennio Morricone score, with the main theme being an earworm that, once heard, can’t be unheard. Also, The Professional might well contain Jean-Paul Belmondo’s best performance, or it’s at least a contender alongside the likes of Breathless and Pierrot le Fou.

16 'Black Bag' (2025)

While it’s recent, Black Bag does already feel pretty iconic as far as modern-day spy movies go, and is also a pretty underrated film, too. It’s about a married couple, both of them spies, and the way their bond is tested when one of them is accused of betraying her country. It starts with a simple hook/moral question, but naturally becomes a good deal more complex as things go on.

Also, Black Bag doesn’t have a ton of time to get complicated, since it’s not much longer than an hour and a half, but it’s very economical, well-edited, and paced extremely well, all the while not being afraid to keep things understated and not too flashy (it’s not an action-focused spy movie, in other words). It comes together well, and, like a good many solid spy movies, will likely benefit from repeat viewings.

15 'Notorious' (1946)

One of Hitchcock’s best spy movies can also be counted among his best romantic films: Notorious. This one came out the year after World War II ended, and its story is all about the war’s aftermath, given it revolves around a government agent and a somewhat mysterious woman both risking a great deal in an effort to first locate, then get to know, and then arrest a Nazi hiding out in Brazil.

Notorious is one of those movies that shows how romance can be linked to the spy genre surprisingly effectively, as the stakes of the spy stuff get heightened when two people are in love, and then the romantic stakes are heightened when spies or agents have to continually pretend to be someone they're not. So, this is one of those movies that’s got a lot to say about both espionage and love, and it all goes down surprisingly smoothly, especially for a film that’s now almost eight decades old.

14 'Mission: Impossible – Fallout' (2018)

In the interest of having a range of movies featured here, there’s only going to be one (out of the eight) Mission: Impossible movies included in the top 20. Of the bunch, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is probably the best, though there are indeed some other excellent Mission: Impossible films, and honestly none that come close to being terrible (yes, even the out-there and messy second movie has its moments).

With Mission: Impossible – Fallout, though, everything is perfectly in place, the pacing is ideal, the action is always exciting and continually escalates, and the stakes feel appropriately grand without any sharks being jumped, so to speak. It’s as good as a Mission: Impossible movie could probably ever be, and also ranks as an all-timer when it comes to action/adventure films more broadly.

13 'Casino Royale' (2006)

Casino Royale kicked off Daniel Craig’s run as James Bond, and did so exceptionally well, being probably the best of the five movies he’d end up starring in. Previous James Bond movies had been intense at times, but Casino Royale felt like it went a step further, and it also ended up working as a bit of a reboot for the series as a whole, or something of an origin story… but not in a corny way; more because the story here concerns Bond’s early work as a 00 agent.

Also, Casino Royale was the first book Ian Fleming wrote in the James Bond series, and it’s done justice with this film for sure. Even if you're not a huge James Bond fan, Casino Royale is pretty easy to recommend as an exciting – and sometimes moving – action/thriller film, and if it was made with the intention of making Bond cool again, then the mission was definitely accomplished.

12 'The Conversation' (1974)

This one is being snuck onto the ranking in a very espionage-y kind of way, a real smuggling operation sort of thing, since The Conversation isn't a spy movie in the traditional sense. Gene Hackman doesn’t really play one or anything, but he is a surveillance expert who becomes obsessed with a couple he’s spying on/listening to, mostly because he feels they might be at risk of getting murdered.

There's not much by way of action in The Conversation, and even the thrills are deliberately muted and subdued for much of its runtime.

There’s tension and paranoia throughout the whole thing, though, yeah, The Conversation is more about spying than it is about a spy. Not much action here or anything, and even the thrills are deliberately muted and subdued for much of The Conversation. But the approach works, and the film is very involving, being one of several great movies Francis Ford Coppola directed in the 1970s.

11 'Lust, Caution' (2007)

There’s a lot going on in Lust, Caution, and it’s hugely ambitious, so being a spy movie is really just one of the things it’s trying to be. It’s also an erotic thriller of sorts, a historical drama, a World War II movie, and something of a romance film, being about a secret agent who’s tasked with first seducing – and then assassinating – a high-ranking official, but things get more complicated during the mission itself, because of course they do.",Collider,2025-10-24T23:20:17Z,https://collider.com/best-spy-movies-of-all-time-ranked/,1.0,2025-10-25 13:59:53.026677,,0.2
SPY,'I'm an ex-burglar - this is why I targeted your home' - Liverpool Echo,,"Ex-burglar Michael Fraser has switched sides and now works as a security consultant

In 2024/2025, there were more than 166,000 home burglaries reported in England and Wales. That equates to an average of 456 a day - or one every 189 seconds, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

For that reason, it is essential making sure your home is safe and secure. And who would know better where the weaknesses in your home are than a former burglar?

Ex-burglar Michael Fraser explains the key way that burglars often know you are away for a prolonged period of time - and how you can make your home secure.

How do they know?

Many Brits have the habit of posting daily updates on social media but they might not realise criminals like some of those posts even more than friends do. Security experts have long warned that real-time holiday snaps and check-ins can tell criminals that your house is empty, and ex-offenders have openly admitted to using public posts to time break-ins.

As ex-burglar Michael puts it: “As for social media, I call that internet shopping… People foolishly put way too much information up on their social sites, and this makes things so simple for a burglar.”

The online clues thieves love

Now a security consultant, Michael says the first step is to 'think like a burglar'. In a recent police campaign, he walked through a house pointing out oversights criminals look for—unlocked windows, valuables on display, single locks—that make an opportunist’s life easy.

He also warns that having your calendar near the window could be dangerous, especially if you mark your holidays or plans on it, because burglars might see your schedule and then commit the crime when you are not at home. Ex-offenders say social media has made that reconnaissance effortless. In one UK feature based on interviews with former burglars, an offender admitted: “We used to keep tabs on when our followers were away from home. We could find out where they were going and how long to plan the best way of making a move.”

Timing is just as important as the content you are posting - real-time holiday snaps or airport check-ins can be read as a vacancy notice.

So what should you show and hide? Keep real-time travel off public feeds, avoid 'checked-in at' posts that confirm your miles from home, and make sure shots do not reveal your street or layout through reflections or background details.

If you like posting décor updates, save them to private stories and strip metadata that gives away location. Surveillance specialists at Online Spy Shop advise practising one simple rule: tighten your social settings and keep personal details off public profiles.

Michael says: “Update your social media privacy settings. People are surprised when they discover their holiday photos are visible to everyone, not just their friends.”

Make your home a harder target

Burglars usually decide if your house is convenient for them just by inspecting the outside. Michael’s walk-throughs with police show how quickly burglars notice weak spots, such as:

- Dark entryways - Keys and handbags visible in the hallway - Tools left in an unlocked shed - A single basic door lock So it is wise to have a proper security system to protect your house. Focus on the basics first. Make sure that your pavement and the outside of the house are well lit and have no deep shadows, overgrown shrubs, or easy climbing aids like wheelie bins or ladders. Consider using hidden recording devices too.

SPY,Ex-burglar says do three key things to make your home more secure | Bristol Live,,"Ex-burglar Michael Fraser has switched sides and now works as a security consultant

In 2024/2025, there were more than 166,000 home burglaries reported in England and Wales. That equates to an average of 456 a day - or one every 189 seconds, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

For that reason, it is essential making sure your home is safe and secure. And who would know better where the weaknesses in your home are than a former burglar?

Ex-burglar Michael Fraser explains the key way that burglars often know you are away for a prolonged period of time - and how you can make your home secure.

How do they know?

Many Brits have the habit of posting daily updates on social media but they might not realise criminals like some of those posts even more than friends do. Security experts have long warned that real-time holiday snaps and check-ins can tell criminals that your house is empty, and ex-offenders have openly admitted to using public posts to time break-ins.

As ex-burglar Michael puts it: “As for social media, I call that internet shopping… People foolishly put way too much information up on their social sites, and this makes things so simple for a burglar.”

The online clues thieves love

Now a security consultant, Michael says the first step is to 'think like a burglar'. In a recent police campaign, he walked through a house pointing out oversights criminals look for—unlocked windows, valuables on display, single locks—that make an opportunist’s life easy.

He also warns that having your calendar near the window could be dangerous, especially if you mark your holidays or plans on it, because burglars might see your schedule and then commit the crime when you are not at home. Ex-offenders say social media has made that reconnaissance effortless. In one UK feature based on interviews with former burglars, an offender admitted : “We used to keep tabs on when our followers were away from home. We could find out where they were going and how long to plan the best way of making a move.”

Timing is just as important as the content you are posting - real-time holiday snaps or airport check-ins can be read as a vacancy notice.

So what should you show and hide? Keep real-time travel off public feeds, avoid 'checked-in at' posts that confirm your miles from home, and make sure shots do not reveal your street or layout through reflections or background details.

If you like posting décor updates, save them to private stories and strip metadata that gives away location. Surveillance specialists at Online Spy Shop advise practising one simple rule: tighten your social settings and keep personal details off public profiles.

Michael says: “Update your social media privacy settings. People are surprised when they discover their holiday photos are visible to everyone, not just their friends.”

Make your home a harder target

Burglars usually decide if your house is convenient for them just by inspecting the outside. Michael’s walk-throughs with police show how quickly burglars notice weak spots, such as:

- Dark entryways - Keys and handbags visible in the hallway - Tools left in an unlocked shed - A single basic door lock So it is wise to have a proper security system to protect your house. Focus on the basics first. Make sure that your pavement and the outside of the house are well lit and have no deep shadows, overgrown shrubs, or easy climbing aids like wheelie bins or ladders. Consider using hidden recording devices too. Sometimes criminals tamper with visible security cameras, but there is a good chance they will not even notice a hidden camera disguised as an everyday object.

SPY,'I'm an ex-burglar and this how we choose which homes to raid' - The Mirror,,"Ex-burglar Michael Fraser says there are some easy ways to make your home less of a target

In 2024/2025, there were more than 166,000 home burglaries reported in England and Wales. That equates to an average of 456 a day - or one every 189 seconds, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

For that reason, it is essential making sure your home is safe and secure. And who would know better where the vulnerabilities in your property lie than a former burglar?

Ex-burglar Michael Fraser reveals the primary method that thieves often use to determine when you are away for an extended period - and how you can protect your home.

How do they find out?

Countless Britons have developed the practice of sharing daily social media updates, but they may not realise that criminals appreciate some of those posts even more than their friends do. Security specialists have repeatedly cautioned that live holiday photographs and location tags can signal to criminals that your property is unoccupied, and former offenders have openly confessed to exploiting public posts to plan their raids.

As ex-burglar Michael explains: ""As for social media, I call that internet shopping... People foolishly put way too much information up on their social sites, and this makes things so simple for a burglar.""

The digital hints criminals love

Now working as a security consultant, Michael states the initial move is to 'think like a burglar'. During a recent police initiative, he toured a property highlighting the mistakes criminals search for - unsecured windows, treasures left visible, basic locks - that make an opportunist's job effortless.

He also cautions that positioning your calendar near the window could prove perilous, particularly if you jot down your holidays or arrangements on it, as burglars might clock your timetable and then strike when you are not at home.

In one UK investigation featuring interviews with ex-burglars, one offender admitted: ""We used to keep tabs on when our followers were away from home. We could find out where they were going and how long to plan the best way of making a move.""

Timing proves just as crucial as the content you're sharing - live holiday snaps or airport check-ins can be interpreted as a vacancy announcement.

What to display and conceal

Keep real-time travel off public feeds, dodge 'checked-in at' posts that confirm you're miles from home, and ensure shots do not expose your street or layout through reflections or background details. If you fancy posting décor updates, save them to private stories and remove metadata that betrays location.

Surveillance experts at Online Spy Shop recommend following one straightforward rule: tighten your social settings and keep personal information off public profiles.

Michael says: ""Update your social media privacy settings. People are surprised when they discover their holiday photos are visible to everyone, not just their friends.""

Make your home a tougher target Burglars often scope out your home for easy access points just by giving it a once-over from the outside. Michael's guided tours with the police reveal how swiftly burglars spot vulnerabilities, such as:

- Dark entrances

- Keys and handbags on display in the hallway

- Tools left in an unlocked shed

- A single basic door lock

So, it is prudent to invest in a robust security system to safeguard your home. Start with the basics. Ensure that your pavement and the exterior of your house are well lit, free from deep shadows, overgrown bushes, or convenient climbing aids like wheelie bins or ladders.

Consider employing covert recording devices as well. Occasionally, criminals meddle with visible security cameras, but there's a high chance they won't even spot a hidden camera disguised as a commonplace object.

Surveillance gurus at Online Spy Shop suggest that covert cameras can serve as 'hidden witnesses, silently observing and recording illicit activity. Footage captured by these cameras can assist authorities in identifying and prosecuting offenders'.

So, while it is a sound idea to have CCTV cameras, you can couple them with hidden cameras to boost your security and surveillance. Before posting anything on your public social media account, ask yourself what a stranger could glean in 10 seconds from your post. Are you away? Can the street be identified? Does any sign in the picture disclose more than you would feel safe sharing?

SPY,Porsche Profits Plummet As Three ICE-Powered Models Are About To Bow Out | Carscoops,,"Porsche has used their third quarter earnings call to reveal time is almost up for three different vehicles including the current gas-powered Macan. This is worth noting as the crossover is the brand’s most popular vehicle as 64,783 units have been delivered in the first nine months of the year.

During the call, Finance and IT Board Member Dr Jochen Breckner said the current ICE-powered Macan will be offered “throughout 2026 and, in some markets, even in 2027, based on a final stocking that we will do.” He went on to say the exact end of production hasn’t been decided, but it will be “more or less in the middle of 2026.”

More: This Audi Q5 Could Actually Be The New ICE Porsche Macan

However, it sounds like the company will stockpile vehicles in important markets to help buy time until the redesigned crossover arrives. Speaking of which, the second-generation Macan will be offered with conventional and plug-in hybrid powertrains. They will be sold alongside the current Macan Electric.

Previous reports have suggested the upcoming model will be based on the Audi Q5 and spy photographers caught a prototype being tested by Porsche earlier this year. The move makes sense as the brand is throttling back their EV push as part of a product realignment that will see “additional models featuring combustion and plug-in-hybrid powertrains.”

As Breckner noted, “Starting in 2028, a more balanced drivetrain offering will further strengthen our market position and support sustainable long-term growth.” This effort will be supported by ICE-powered versions of the redesigned 718 as well as the next Macan, which is apparently being referred to as the “B-SUV.” Furthermore, Porsche’s flagship SUV has abandoned electric power and will instead offer gas and plug-in hybrid options.

Getting back to the 718, the current Boxster and Cayman are quickly approaching the end of the line. Production wraps up later this month and Breckner said “we are producing the very last cars these days.” However, the automaker will still have a handful of models in inventory to help tide things over until the next-generation sports car arrives.

Porsche Is Having A Terrible Year

As for the financials, they weren’t pretty despite record deliveries in the United States. Through the first nine months of the year, Porsche’s operating profit plummeted from over €4 ($4.6) billion in 2025 to a mere €40 ($46) million this time around.

The company blamed the massive drop on a variety of factors including their product realignment strategy, challenging market conditions in China, and “one-off effects” relating to battery activities. Tariffs also played a role and it sounds like they’ll cost the company around €700 ($814) million this year alone.

To help offset the impact of tariffs, Porsche will “further strengthen” their pricing position throughout 2025 and 2026. The company has also increased prices to keep their margins at a “decent level.”

Despite terrible looking numbers, Porsche noted automotive net cash flow increased from €1.24 ($1.44) billion to €1.34 ($1.56) billion. The company said this “demonstrates the resilience of the business operations and shows that Porsche is performing robustly even under challenging conditions.”

SPY,From Shah Rukh Khan to simple love: The unexpected return of the Bollywood romantic drama,,"Instead, I was there for the opening of Saiyaara, a simple musical romance. That day, the theatre was overflowing with teens and young adults.

When the theatre lights went down, the debut performances by Aneet Padda and Ahaan Panday delivered a rare emotional punch, mixing intense laughter with moments that brought the audience to tears.

“Where do they make boys like him these days?"" murmured one teenage viewer to her neighbour in the dark, as Krish Kapoor (played by Panday) professes his love to Vaani Batra (Padda) on the big screen.

This emotional resonance brought me back to my own youth, specifically to the simple charm of Surinder Sahni in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) and the consuming, tragic passion of Rahul Jaykar (played by Aditya Roy Kapur) in Aashiqui 2 (2013). In those years, the Bollywood box office was almost entirely driven by the popularity of romantic dramas.

Clearly, I was not alone. For days afterward, social media platforms were flooded with content—short videos, detailed posts, and argumentative threads—all celebrating or critically dissecting Saiyaara.

This reaction came as a surprise to industry professionals—distributors, exhibitors, and filmmakers. They had nearly concluded that the straightforward romantic film was no longer a profitable venture in modern Hindi cinema.

“No one was expecting the kind of response from the movie. But since so many people were lining up, the number of screens and shows were increased,"" Sankalp Sadanah, who penned Saiyaara’s story, told Mint.

The film’s record-breaking ticket sales of ₹20 crore on the first day at the Indian box office led to screen space increasing to 3,800 in the second week from 2,225 screens in the first week, Yash Raj Films, Saaiyara’s Mumbai-based production house, said in an email response.

Then there was Maddock Films’ Param Sundari, another romantic film, that released on 29 August. It has collected ₹36.92 crore in its first week on a reported ₹40-60 crore spend, according to Box Office India, a website publishing trade data, on the back of tickets being bought by the Gen-Z.

The opening weekends of these two films fared better than many recent mega-budget, multi-starrer, and action-dramas, challenging the assumption that only big-budget spectacles could draw crowds. It also debunked the assumption that India’s Gen Z and Gen Alpha, the world’s largest young population with over 350 million people under 25, were irrevocably digital-first, preferring streaming platforms over brick and mortar cinema theatres.

The pipeline

Nonetheless, the magic fell short in many cases. Subsequent romantic releases, Dharma Production’s Dhadak 2 and Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari, collectively grossed less than ₹100 crore in their first week. Even the early momentum of Param Sundari couldn't be sustained, winding down its three-week theatrical run with a total of only ₹47.61 crore.

But that has not stopped Hindi filmmakers and studios from looking out for romance scripts, said half a dozen writers Mint spoke with. More love stories are therefore expected to enter the commercial movie pipeline, releasing between 2026 and 2027.

Dharma Productions has commenced work on two of them—Tu Meri Main Tera Main Tera Tu Meri and Chand Mera Dil. T-Series’ Tere Ishk Mein, which has actors Dhanush and Kriti Sanon in lead, is expected to release in November.

A cycle

India’s tryst with making pure play love stories isn’t new—it hurls back to the 1970s.

Aparna Ramachandran, head of digital content at Balaji Telefilms, offered a sense of this historical perspective. “This is a cyclical event because love stories are staple and classic,"" she stated.

Staple love stories that worked propelled careers.

Raj Kapoor-directed Bobby (1973), for instance, kick-started Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia’s Hindi film careers; Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988) made Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla famous; Maine Pyaar Kiya (1989) marked the beginning of Salman Khan’s superstardom. Romantic-drama Dil was the highest grossing film of 1990, along with Mahesh Bhatt-directed Aashiqui, which brought Anu Aggarwal and Rahul Roy to the limelight. In 1995, Yash Raj Films’ Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, made the lead pair popular among Indian diaspora in Western countries.

These landmark films often followed a formula that moved Bollywood away from the family dramas and action films of the 1980s.

“A classic love story is one where the movie’s main conflict and resolution revolve around a couple’s romantic relationship,"" said Rohan Ghuge, a screenplay writer, who wrote romantic-comedy Luka Chuppi, and the dialogues for Saiyaara.

Apart from an engaging story, a typical Bollywood romance also features captivating soundtracks.

“Songs definitely play an important role for me when watching a movie,"" said Mayank Singh, a 24-year-old business developer based in Bengaluru. “One of the reasons to watch Zara Hatke Zara Bachke was because I liked the song Tere Vaaste,"" Singh added.

Jio Studio-backed Zara Hatke Zara Bachke (2023), centred around a married couple trying to buy a house, grossed ₹71.66 crore in the domestic market, according to Box Office India.

Saiyaara’s soundtrack was no exception. Its six original songs topped most audio streaming charts; millions of streams and short-video creations across social media platforms fuelled the pre-release hype and subsequent theatrical footfall.

The decade of action

For almost 10 years, the Hindi film industry struggled to produce a romantic musical that achieved major commercial success. The last noteworthy hit centered on a couple’s love story—Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017).

The Hindi film industry has struggled to produce a major hit romantic musical for almost 10 years, with the last noteworthy success being Badrinath Ki Dulhania.

During this period, biographical dramas like Sanju (2018), action thrillers such as War (2019), and historical epics like Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior (2020) dominated the box office. Following the covid-19 lockdowns, the focus shifted even more toward large-scale, star-driven action franchises.

Despite several big-budget disappointments, Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan and Jawan managed to rule the box office in 2023.

Globally, the trend of big-budget, superhero, and action movies took root after Avengers: Endgame (2019) grossed $2.79 billion worldwide, including $62 million in India. This pushed major Indian production studios like Yash Raj Films to develop their own shared cinematic universes, such as the YRF Spy Universe and the Maddock Horror Comedy Universe.

This relentless pursuit of blockbuster profits led to the neglect of softer genres like romance. “For most of the past decade, we sidelined the softer genres because our resources and creative energy were directed toward action projects, which usually have big budgets,"" explained screenwriter Sameer Mishra, who wrote Physicswallah for Amazon Prime Video, among other shows.

However, films are a risky business, and many of these big-budget projects became financial “bombs"", leading to crises and shelved projects.

But Saiyaara’s box office success has changed the conversation on budgets and casting. “Today, one cannot bet too much just on the star cast. They could pull in an audience but people are willing to pay to watch even fresh faces provided the content is good,"" said Ashish Pandey, head, content programming and strategic initiatives, Cineline India Ltd, which runs multiplex chain Moviemax.

Romantic dramas can be produced on relatively modest budgets—anywhere between ₹10 crore and ₹50 crore—depending on the cast. In contrast, action and superhero films require much larger investments. To be sure, Saiyaara was made on a budget of ₹60 crore, due to marketing and distribution being handled by Yash Raj Film’s in-house verticals.

The story nobody believes

Apart from casting diversification, screenwriters are being approached by studios to offer romantic, romcom or romantic-drama scripts. Yash Raj Films had approached director Mohit Suri for a love story script about two years before Saiyaara’s release, said screenwriter Sankalp Sadanah.

Yash Raj Films did not respond to Mint’s request for an interaction with Akshaye Widhani, the company’s chief executive officer.

But some film watchers sense a struggle—Bollywood, they say, probably still doesn’t understand GenZ and Gen Alpha relationships very well.

“Love stories made in Hindi are still very old school. Most people in our generation are meeting through dating apps,"" said Mayank Singh. There is barely any portrayal of the digital influence on life, he added.

While many youngsters want to experience love, they also want characters that resonate with reality, the 24-year-old further added. Moreover, the industry's failure to reflect the diversity of modern relationships is glaring.

“Much of the love stories in India have long served as an escape from reality, setting fantasy driven expectations,"" said Natasha Nayak, film marketer and founder, Culture Shock Media. “Same-sex couples usually have a side plot; almost never the central part of a romantic premise,"" she added.

To connect with the growing youth audience, Bollywood must move beyond simply choosing younger casts and following the formula we mentioned above. Production houses need to rethink their storytelling approach and portray relationships that reflect digital-age experiences, social diversity, and the everyday realities of modern life.",mint,2025-10-25T01:31:18Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/saiyaara-param-sundari-romance-revival-bollywood-11761035751152.html,0.7,2025-10-25 13:59:08.763261,,0.419607843137255

SPY,Tanzania's first female president has defied early hopes that she would ease repression,,"KAMPALA, Uganda — Less than six months after Samia Suluhu Hassan was inaugurated as Tanzania’s first woman president in 2021, the country’s most famous cartoonist depicted her in a military general’s uniform under the title “Dictatoress.”

In the cartoon by Tanzanian-born Gado, drawn from his base in Kenya where there is more press freedom, Hassan looks at her image in a mirror and sees herself as holding a torch — perhaps of liberty — when actually she wields a spiked club.

A former vice president who rose to the presidency after the death of predecessor John Pombe Magufuli, Hassan initially gave indications that she would relax the government’s repressive tactics against opposition leaders, civic groups, journalists and others.

But as Hassan seeks her first properly elected term in Oct. 29 elections, critics say she has defied early hopes of easing repression and instead shown an authoritarian streak.

Amnesty International said in a statement this week that repression in Tanzania has “intensified” with civilian abuses ranging from arbitrary arrests to enforced disappearances and even extrajudicial killings.

Single-party rule

Hassan’s political group, known as Chama cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, is one of Africa’s longest-ruling parties. A version of CCM, which maintains ties with the Chinese Communist Party, has held power since independence in 1961.

Although Tanzania is yet to witness an orderly transfer of power from one party to another, regular elections featuring successive leaders of CCM have long guaranteed a measure of stability that is rare among neighbors in the region.

That leadership model is gradually being challenged, with the opposition party Chadema consistently the strongest of the groups trying to break CCM’s grip on Tanzania. Chadema’s popular leader, Tundu Lissu, who survived an assassination attempt in 2017, is currently jailed on treason charges.

Chadema has said it will not participate in elections without the reforms it says are necessary to have free and fair polling, a stance that led to its disqualification by electoral authorities.

Another popular candidate, Luhaga Mpina of the Alliance for Change and Transformation-Wazalendo party, is also disqualified from running for allegedly violating his own party’s constitution.

Running against opponents from smaller parties, Hassan is effectively unopposed and will almost certainly be elected, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, or ACLED, a U.S.-based nonprofit that collects data on political violence around the world.

Tanzania’s election “will follow over four-and-a-half years of sustained repression by a CCM-controlled state that is keen to avoid the electoral pressures” faced by opposition parties elsewhere in Africa, ACLED said in a recent analysis.

CCM, after receiving its lowest-ever share of the vote in the 2015 election, has “since neutered Tanzania’s opposition through administrative, legal, and extra-legal means,"" the group said.

Rights abuses

In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019. The experts said they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections, after two pro-democracy activists from Uganda and Kenya went missing in Tanzania, where they had gone to attend Lissu’s treason trial.

The activists, Boniface Mwangi of Kenya and Agather Atuhaire of Uganda, later reported that they had been sexually abused before they were deported.

A recent high-profile disappearance is of Humphrey Polepole, Tanzania’s former ambassador to Cuba, who resigned his post earlier this year. His resignation letter, leaked on social media, cited his loss of “peace of heart and faith” in a government that he said violates the rule of law.

Hassan responded by revoking Polepole’s diplomatic status, and earlier in October he was allegedly grabbed by unknown people at his home in the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam. His whereabouts remain unknown despite calls for his freedom.

It was not possible to get a comment from Hassan. A presidential spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions.

Lifting a ban on gatherings

Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International analyst, told The Associated Press that Hassan raised hopes early in her presidency with progressive measures such as lifting a ban on the right of opposition groups to hold rallies outside the electoral season.

But she has been just as responsible for the government's turn toward more repression since then, Ebole said.

As the chairperson of CCM, “she cannot…distance herself from these violations,” Ebole said. “Her role as head of state and commander-in-chief places her directly in charge of the country’s security apparatus, giving her the authority to end the violations and restore a culture of respect for human rights.”

When Hassan took over as president, she asserted her authority by recruiting associates who had fallen out of favor with Magufuli, the previous president.

She is said to keep a small circle of advisors, and last year she appointed her third director of the Tanzania Intelligence and Security Service, the domestic spy agency, a high turnover that some analysts saw as a sign she was in charge or trying to consolidate power.

Hassan is running under the slogan “Work and Dignity,” promising opportunities in crop and livestock farming, the country's top industry. Her vision has been summarized as the Four Rs, which stand for reconciliation, reforms, rebuilding, and resilience.

Foreign direct investment has rebounded after Magufuli alienated many investors with aggressive tax measures, and while Hassan's pro-business stance has cheered many observers, critics say she has failed to seize an opportunity to be a consensus leader.

Many Tanzanians still hope for change.

“We expected more freedom, especially for political rallies and the press,” said one resident of Dar es Salaam, a man who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal from the authorities.

“But it feels like things are going back to the old ways.”",Newsday,2025-10-24T10:31:59Z,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/tanzania-election-president-samia-suluhu-hassan-v95285,0.7,2025-10-25 13:59:38.216630,,0.1137254901960785

SPY,Editor's Pick: Free Beacon Reveals Politico Reporter Facing Probe for Being Chinese Spy,,"Over at the Washington Free Beacon, reporter Matthew Xiao delivered a bombshell Friday that an unnamed Politico reporter is being investigated by “European security services…for working a Chinese spy.”

Xiao cited the original scoop from “European news site Euractiv” that said the Brussels, Belgium-based reporter “is suspected of using their position as a journalist to cultivate potential targets working in Brussels-based international organisations, including by making sexual overtures towards officials in these institutions.”

He added the reporter is no longer with Politico and the company has largely declined to comment, telling Euractiv they don’t “comment on personnel departures.”

SPY,Stocks Rally on Strength in Energy Shares and US-China Trade Hopes,,"The US government shutdown continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown is delaying the release of government reports, including the last four weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 99% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled mixed on Thursday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.52%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.22%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.35%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Thursday closed down -10 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +4.4 bp to 3.993%. T-notes were under pressure on Thursday amid inflation concerns, as a +5% surge in WTI crude oil prices boosted inflation expectations and pushed the 10-year breakeven inflation rate to a 1-week high of 2.31%. Also, Thursday’s rally in stocks curbed safe-haven demand for T-notes.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields moved higher on Thursday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +2.0 bp to 2.583%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +0.6 bp to 4.423%.

The Eurozone Oct consumer confidence indicator survey unexpectedly rose +0.7 to an 8-month high of -14.2, stronger than expectations of a decline to -15.0.

Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

SPY,Minnesota Vikings see their season strategy skid sideways after loss to Los Angeles Chargers,,"The Minnesota Vikings were all-in on developing quarterback J.J. McCarthy this season, after his rookie year was lost to injury, with the belief they could insulate him from some of the natural struggles of inexperience by surrounding him with a stacked veteran team and a savvy coaching staff.

After a bumpy start put some holes in the plan, the blueprint all but disintegrated in a blowout to the Los Angeles Chargers on Thursday. Not only have the players and schemes on offense and defense failed to deliver, but they've had all of two games during which to test McCarthy.

""I told our team, 'This is where we're going to find out what we're all about,'"" coach Kevin O'Connell said after the 37-10 defeat that was the second worst in his four seasons.

The Vikings were dealt a tough blow when McCarthy, the 10th overall pick in the draft last year, needed meniscus surgery on his right knee before making it to the regular season. The high sprain of his right ankle he finished his second game with has been even more devastating, considering the way Sam Darnold mostly flourished in 2024 and Carson Wentz has mostly flopped in 2024.

After going 2-3 with Wentz, who played through a non-throwing shoulder injury that took plenty of hard hits during an increasingly painful night, McCarthy is line to return next week. With the Vikings (3-4) currently in 12th place in the NFC, and last by two losses in their daunting division, even remarkable progress by McCarthy over the last 10 games might not be enough to get them in the playoffs.

Wentz had the misfortune of playing most of the game without stalwart tackles Christian Darrisaw and Brian O'Neill because of knee injuries, not to mention center Ryan Kelly, who's hardly been available. On the other side, the free agent spending spree on defensive tackles in their 30s, Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave, has not paid dividends. And the lack of production from recent drafts has left them without enough depth at cornerback, not to mention other positions.

""That's all a team effort,"" wide receiver Justin Jefferson said, ""and we're just not doing enough.""

What's working

There's not much for the Vikings to feel good about. Rookie Myles Price had a 27-yard average on five kickoff returns, continuing to show an aggressiveness and a burst that appears to be close to breaking him free for a score. Fittingly, he had a 46-yard runback to open the game and a 42-yard return in the third quarter, both of which were wiped out by holding penalties on rookie Tyler Batty.

What needs help

The defense against the run has been the most frequent and damaging issue this season. Just four days after Flores loaded up to keep 2024 rushing champ Saquon Barkley at bay and keep a spy on nimble Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Vikings were trampled by second-year bruiser Kimani Vidal. Justin Herbert scrambled seven times himself for a backbreaking 62 yards, as the Chargers became the second team to top the 200-yard mark on the Vikings this season. They held 10 different opponents to 86 rushing yards or fewer last season.

Stock up

Winning performances were in short supply, but edge rusher Jonathan Greenard — matched up against the fifth overall pick in the 2024 draft, Joe Alt — was in the backfield often. He had six tackles, three for loss, and one sack with two hits on Herbert. Defensive tackle Jalen Redmond also stood out, playing 86% of the snaps, by far the most of all the interior linemen.

Stock down

OLB Dallas Turner. The 2024 first-round draft pick has been forced into a critical role with Pro Bowl pick Andrew Van Ginkel missing five of the first seven games to injury, and the consistency and production haven't been there for a player the Vikings traded up to get last year. Turner has not yet shown he can be a reliable run-stopper, and he has just 1½ sacks. Turner also took a 15-yard penalty for a helmet-first hit on Herbert in the first quarter that gave the Chargers a first-and-goal.

Injury report

After fielding their most complete lineup of the season last Sunday against Philadelphia, the Vikings took a concerning step back with their overall health, thanks in part to the grueling four-day turnaround for the trip to Los Angeles. Darrisaw left after two series, and O'Neill couldn't make it at all. Kelly (concussion) must miss at least one more game, but there's no telling when or if he'll return. Fullback C.J. Ham (hand) was inactive on Thursday along with Van Ginkel (neck). The return of running back Aaron Jones from a four-game absence was one positive.

Now the Vikings have three extra days of recovery for a potential boost prior to their Nov. 2 game at Detroit, with McCarthy likely to lead the list of returners. New injuries that popped up against the Chargers were to Greenard (ankle) and tight end Josh Oliver (foot), whose departure in the first quarter was a hindrance to getting the running game going before the score got out of hand with another key blocker Ham already out.

Key number

0-6 — The Vikings have lost all six night road games they've played in four years under O'Connell, including three on Thursdays. O'Connell is 4-11 overall at night, including the loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the playoffs last season. The Vikings have dropped four straight in prime time by a combined score of 117-34. But this pattern predated O'Connell. Over the past 20 years, encompassing four coaching staffs, the Vikings are 9-28 on the road at night and 24-42 overall. They're 1-9 all time on Thursdays on the road, last winning in 1978.

SPY,The unusual budget ski destination with better snow than the Alps,,"I’m skiing in Erciyes, Turkey’s largest resort, where long broad pistes sweep down the flanks of Mount Erciyes — a 3,917m dormant volcano with a near-perfect cone that dominates the Central Anatolian plain, in the heart of the country. Getting here can be a shlep — fly to Istanbul and then it’s a 90-minute internal flight to the ancient city of Kayseri — but once you arrive you’re greeted by Turkey’s fifth-highest peak. Only two summits in the Alps rise higher: Mont Blanc and the Dufourspitze on Monte Rosa.

While Britons have embraced the good-value skiing in Bulgaria, Turkey has so far been largely overlooked, despite the country having more than 40 resorts, from Ejder 3200 in Palandoken, near Erzurum, in the far east of Anatolia, to Uludag near Bursa, a short ferry ride from Istanbul and a winter playground for the city’s elite.

Erciyes’s credentials are impressive. The top lift climbs to about 3,400m, higher than in most Alpine resorts; the lift network — two gondolas and 12 chairlifts — is modern; and there are 55km of pistes, many of them wide, cruisy blues and unthreatening reds. These days there’s good rental equipment too.

Among our group visiting the resort is Dan Egan, a celebrated US extreme skier who made his name appearing in Warren Miller ski films and visited the area 30 years ago. “Back then there was just one lift,” he says. “There was a winding road up to the lift and the ‘rental’ shop was all outdoors. The Turkish guys running the rentals had lines of skis with boots already clipped into them. There were guys walking around in socks trying on the boots. Once they found a pair that fitted, they were off.”

• How to book a cheap ski holiday: 19 tips

Thankfully progress has been remarkable in the intervening years, including the building of a smart Radisson Blu hotel, where I’m staying, one of a dozen or so three and four-star hotels dotted along the main road that is an artery through the resort. It has a cosy Alpine-style bar and serves a huge nightly buffet. The next morning, we hop on the high-speed six-person Kultepe chairlift — free of the queues that trouble many Alpine resorts — and whizz down the red run beneath it, carving on the corduroy snow. The best part? The crowds of locals from the night before have all but vanished, leaving us virtually alone on the piste.

The ski area is divided into four zones, or “gates”, each with its own base area, small shops and places to eat. We work our way across the mountain, staying high before dropping down to Hisarcik gate and jumping on the Keven chairlift. It’s from here that we spy a treat: a gully that remarkably, considering it hasn’t snowed for several days, holds almost untouched powder.

We skirt past the signs that warn that “going down to the valley is dangerous and forbidden” — they love a sign here, they’re everywhere — and follow the handful of tracks leading into the inviting gully. It is fabulous skiing down a natural half-pipe that deposits us into a wide powder field.

Our little group laps the chairlift, taking different lines down the gully. In good conditions there are some great pockets of powder to be found, helped by the undulations and gullies formed by lava flows during volcanic eruptions in about 6000BC.

I’d already been told that most of the local skiers avoid the off-piste because of their ability level, and the warning signs are designed to deter the more daring from giving it a go, which is why powder that would be tracked out in 30 minutes in the Alps can linger for days. There’s more to be found off the slopes served by the Divan and Ottoman chairlifts, although it can be windswept at the top.

We stop for lunch at Quup Lounge at the base of Hisarcik gate, one of several restaurants in a large modern building at the foot of the slopes. Like many of the small cafés, it’s family run and serves regional specialities including Adana kebab, made with spiced lamb; Kayseri yağlama, thin layered flatbreads with a minced meat filling; and chicken shish kebab cooked over a charcoal fire. It’s a far cry from the cheese fondue and tartiflette you expect in France — and another bonus of coming all this way.

• 11 of the best great-value ski resorts in Europe

Kayseri, the nearest city, is also celebrated for its pastirma, a heavily seasoned, air-dried cured meat, and manti, a sort of Turkish ravioli with mince and a garlicky yogurt sauce — both excellent.

We sit on the sun-trap terrace at Quup Lounge and toast our morning adventure with the Turkish beer Efes, before a man with a drum — and 50 lira note tips (about 90p) hanging over the arms of his glasses — arrives to entertain the crowd. The whole lunch, for six people, comes to about £75 — unbelievable value compared with what you pay at even small Alpine resorts.

It’s the same story with lift passes. Unlike in the Alps, where most people plump for week-long tickets, in Erciyes skiers buy a pass pre-loaded with a set number of rides. It’s a system designed for locals, but gives visitors great flexibility. And the prices are astonishingly low: a seven-ride pass costs £8, 14 rides are £12.50 and 30 rides £25.

Which is why, when we draw back the curtains one morning to zero visibility — the high altitude means there’s no tree cover — we jump in the car and drive for 75 minutes west to Cappadocia, one of Turkey’s most extraordinary landscapes (trips can be arranged locally).

• Best things to do in Cappadocia

Its rock pinnacles (known as “fairy chimneys”), underground villages and homes cut into the soft volcanic stone date as far back as the 4th century. We stop at viewpoints overlooking the honey-hued valleys, some dusted in snow, that will be packed with tourists in summer. In late January, though, we’re the only ones here, even at the juice stand, where a young man squeezes a cup of sweet pomegranate and orange juice for me.

It’s the same in the town of Goreme, where most visitors who come for the area’s famous hot-air balloon trips stay. I stroll around its winding streets admiring the cave hotels, churches cut into the rock and little shops selling pottery, carpets and trinkets as snow falls softly.

By dawn the clouds have parted, leaving a couple of inches of fresh powder. The best of it, I’m told by a local ski instructor, lies beneath the Lifos gondola from the Hacilar gate. From the top of the lift, to the skier’s right, stretches a huge expanse of terrain that is untouched. I loop up and down all morning and mid-morning; the lifties kindly offer skiers cups of sweet Turkish tea.

It is magical skiing, and I meet only a couple of other tourists over dozens of gondola rides. By the end of the afternoon we’ve tracked out most of the terrain, to the amazement of a young snowboarder from Kayseri. He is curious why our group of friends has visited his country to ski. Of course, such a trip is not for everybody, but I was impressed with the resort, its facilities, the food and the friendliness. For skiers looking for an adventure that’s beyond different to what you find in the Alps, Erciyes offers it and the chance to see Cappadocia away from the crowds.

We finish with some more conventional après-ski, sitting Efes in hand outside the Divan Winter House bar-restaurant at the Hisarcik gate. Western music plays and the school-age children of the owners are already being put to work, bringing around snacks of local sausages. Suddenly the music stops, giving way to the faint but now familiar call to prayer in the distance.

SPY,The F-22 'Super' Stealth Fighter Is Coming,,"Key Points and Summary – The Trump administration is backing an “F-22 Super” upgrade to keep the Raptor dominant until the 6th-gen F-47 arrives.

-This “Viability” program, which has received initial funding, aims to enhance the F-22 with new stealth coatings, advanced sensors, an Infrared Defense System, and new stealthy, range-extending fuel tanks.

-While the F-22 fleet currently suffers from low combat-coded numbers and readiness issues, these upgrades are intended to create a more lethal “Day One” fighter.

-The “Super” should be upgraded to control drones (CCAs), carry hypersonic missiles, and be exported to allies.

What’s Great About the F-22 “Super”

The F-22 Raptor is an excellent airplane, but instead of retiring it early, before the F-47 NGAD comes online, the Donald Trump national security team aims to make a “Super” F-22 that can instill confidence in an Air Force transitioning to sixth-generation flight.

The F-22 has always been super stealthy and a pilot’s dream.

Being assigned to the F-22, whether as an aviator or a technician/maintainer, is considered an elite duty assignment.

The F-22, due to its highly advanced technology, is not available for export, but that could change with the F-22 Super.

Will the White House Get What It Wants?

The Air Force has even set aside $90 million for the F-22 “Viability” program.

So that shows that Trump may get his wish for a more “beautiful” airplane with new upgrades.

The F-22 Super will feature an even better stealth coating for enhanced radar evasion.

There will be an improved radar and sensor suite, plus electronic warfare capabilities will be stronger.

The F-22 Super Is Spoiling for a Real Fight

One criticism of the F-22 is that it has little combat experience aside from a Chinese spy balloon “kill” in 2023.

That is not necessarily a fair judgment about the Raptor.

The airplane has spent its time on active duty during the Global War on Terror, when the Taliban and other insurgents in the Middle East had no adversarial aircraft to threaten the Raptor. Plus, the F-22 was not fully equipped with ground strike capability.

F-22 Super Fighting on Day One of Combat and Not In Reserve

This could all change with the rise of great powers like Russia and China.

The Air Force needs the F-22 Super to be a Day One aircraft in a potential conflict, capable of taking on fifth-generation fighters like the Chinese J-20 and the Russian Su-57. Dogfighting capabilities need to be improved with the “Super,” and it looks like Trump will get his wish for a more lethal, powerful fighter jet.

The Super will also have an Infrared Defense System for better survivability. This will improve search, track, and battle control in combat. Range-extending drop tanks will be stealthy to maximize radar evasion.

The Super needs to improve its F-22 readiness. This maintenance downtime has dogged the program for years.

The F-22 Readiness Problem

“This is a new start effort for which the service is asking for $90.34 million in funding in the upcoming fiscal cycle,” the FY2026 Air Force budget request report said. “The Air Force currently has 185 F-22s, but only 143 are combat-coded, with the rest being dedicated to training and test, and evaluation activities. A significant portion of the overall fleet is typically down for maintenance, as well. The small Raptor force is already highly capable and heavily in demand.”

F-22 Super: How Many?

It’s not clear how many F-22s will get the Super upgrades and receive the higher-level standard with updated features.

The upgrade process could take years, and the F-22 could still have readiness problems with low combat-coded numbers.

Some of the older models may be forced to retire to alleviate budget needs that would send more dollars to the Super program.

Plus, $90 million for the next fiscal year is not a king’s ransom.

There will need to be more dollars cut loose for the Super project in the years to come. But as long as Trump is president and Republicans control the two Armed Services Committees in Congress, look for the Super to have “wings.”

What I Would Like to See in the F-22 Super

The F-22 is not known for ground-strike capabilities; it is actually more of an air superiority jet.

But it can deliver JDAMs and Small Diameter Bombs. It would be better to deploy air-launched land-attack cruise missiles and some of the new air-to-ground hypersonic missiles.

I would also like to see the Super be able to control a Loyal Wingman drone, such as the new unmanned Collaborative Combat Aircraft.

Chinese and Russian fighters will be able to fly with Loyal Wingmen, and the F-22 needs that capability too.

I recommend exporting the F-22 Super. This would take an act of Congress, but our allies need another choice beyond the F-35. This would be an additional American option for NATO members, and would be especially valuable for the Japanese, South Koreans, and Taiwanese in East Asia. Ukraine could also fly it. In fact, Ukraine has just agreed to buy Swedish-made JAS 39 Gripens. This is a great airplane, but it is not fully stealthy like the F-22 Super would be.

What if the F-22 Super also had a naval aircraft carrier version? This would give the Navy an aircraft that could replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet until the sixth-generation F/A-XX comes online. The F-22 Super could supplement the F-35C on aircraft carriers to form whole stealth-fighter air wings.

The F-22 Super should also have more artificial intelligence and even quantum computing in the cockpit. This would allow it to fire hypersonic missiles better and control the Collaborative Combat Aircraft. AI and quantum computing would be an expensive addition to the F-22, but it is technically feasible.

The Super F-22 Will Be Special

In all, the F-22 Super is exciting. Trump is getting involved in specific defense acquisition major end items, and he now has his own wish list instead of relying on what the Air Force generals tell him.

He saw how successful the B-2 bomber was against Iranian nuclear sites, and he wants more presidential toys that he picks specifically.

It seems that, with the White House doing the heavy political lifting, Republicans on Capitol Hill will support his desire for improved airplanes, which means we could see an F-22 Super before the F-47 NGAD flies regularly in the late 2020s.

SPY,Men jailed over Russian-backed arson attack on Ukrainian aid warehouse in London,,"Six men have been sentenced for their roles in what a judge described as a ""campaign of terrorism and sabotage"" for Russia, as ITV News Correspondent Sejal Karia reports
A group of thugs who worked for the Russian mercenary Wagner Group have been jailed for setting fire to a warehouse storing aid to Ukraine, as part of a planned “campaign of terrorism and sabotage"".
The arson attack on the industrial units in Leyton, east London, on March 20 2024, caused about £1 million in damage, put lives at risk, and required 60 firefighters to put out.
The warehouse was targeted by the terrorist Wagner Group because it was being used to supply humanitarian aid and StarLink satellite equipment to Ukraine.
Afterwards, the architect Dylan Earl set his sights on more “missions”, targeting a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnapping of the owner, the wealthy Russian dissident Evgeny Chichvarkin.
The court heard Earl was a member of numerous pro-Russian propaganda channels and was motivated by “simple and ugly greed”.
On Friday, Earl and five other young men were sentenced at the Old Bailey for what the judge described as a “planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage” in the interests of the Russian state.
Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said: “This case is about the efforts of the Russian Federation to gain pernicious global influence using social media to enlist saboteurs vast distances from Moscow.”
She said the arson attack was not an isolated incident, as another warehouse was hit in Spain ten days later, and Earl had discussed another potential attack in the Czech Republic.
The judge found the arson attack did have a “terrorist connection” regardless of whether or not the perpetrators knew it.
Earl, 21, and fellow organiser Jake Reeves, 24, admitted charges against them, making them the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023.
Drug dealer Earl, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, was jailed for 17 years and a further six years on an extended licence for his “leading role” in the terrorist activities.
Reeves, from Croydon, south London, was handed 12 years in prison and one year on extended licence.
Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, south London, was jailed for eight years and 10 months, Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, south London, was jailed for nine years, and homeless Ugnius Asmena, 21, was jailed for seven years, after they were found guilty of carrying out the aggravated arson following an Old Bailey trial.
They were each handed a further year on extended licence by the judge, who observed the “true price” of what some might see as “easy money”.
The court had heard that Earl and Reeves never left their bedrooms as they orchestrated the arson attack for the Wagner Group, which was acting on behalf of the Russian Federation.
Earl told a Wagner Group operative whom he met on Telegram that he was keen to carry out a series of “missions”, of which the Leyton fire was to be the first.
In chat, Earl’s contact, Privet Bot, instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a “manual” for his covert mission.
Earl was arrested in a B&Q car park in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his iPhone.

In a search of his home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine hydrochloride with a street value of some £34,000.
Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000.
In mitigation for Earl, Paul Hynes KC said he was “easy meat” for exploitation by the Wagner Group, as he saw the world through the “prism of online gaming”.
Mr Hynes said: “This is not a John le Carre novel. But nevertheless those who would wish the UK and other countries ill will continue to try to latch on to people like Mr Earl.”
After the sentencing, Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing London, said: “This case is a clear example of an organisation linked to the Russian state using ‘proxies’, in this case British men, to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf.""

The furore surrounding Prince Andrew continues to worsen, and it appears King Charles is ready to finally clean house.
Prince Andrew is in advanced talks about moving out of Royal Lodge following the bombshell revelation about his rent.
Pressure has mounted on the royal family for Andrew to vacate the 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park amid the continuing controversy over his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and the posthumous publication of the memoirs of the prince’s sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.

According to fresh reports, the public accounts committee has confirmed it is writing to the crown estate and the Treasury after it emerged Andrew paid £1 million ($2 million) for the lease of the property in 2003, and was required to undertake £7.5 million ($15 million) refurbishment costs, but that he has since paid “one peppercorn” of rent.
The Telegraph has reported that Buckingham Palace is desperate to increase pressure on Andrew to voluntarily leave the residence.
It’s believed Andrew is unable to be evicted due to a “cast iron” lease agreement with the crown estate.
Royal sources have seen a “renewed determination” to force him out, added the insider.
Should he be forced out of Royal Lodge, under the terms of the lease he would be entitled to £558,000 ($1.14 million).

It comes as it emerged that Andrew reportedly urged his staff and friends to “arrange girls” for him, leading to him having sex with women “he didn’t realise were prostitutes”.
In his explosive new biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, author Andrew Lownie claims that the disgraced royal begged his inner circle – including his taxpayer-funded personal protection officers (PPOs) – to find women he could date.
“He would spy out an attractive ballerina at the Royal Ballet and then send his [PPO] … to invite her to meet the prince. Other variations included sending aides to invite girls to his table at [London nightclub] Chinawhite or come to his hotel suite when abroad,” wrote Lownie.
“Andrew’s staff often requested that attractive women be invited to events, with a private secretary specifying, ‘He likes blondes’ — to which one consul replied, ‘I’m a diplomat, not a pimp.’”

He added, “He liked to stay in hotels rather than the [Royal] Residence as it gave him more independence in whom he saw, whether women or businessmen.
“Stories are told of escorts, masquerading as professional women, being provided that he could pick up.”

SPY,"Six metres below ground, a hospital treats Ukrainian soldiers injured by Russian drones",,"Scrubby trees hide the entrance. A sloping wooden tunnel descends to a brightly lit reception area. There is a surgery unit, equipped with beds, cardiac monitors and ventilators. And shelves full of medical equipment, drugs and neat piles of spare clothes. In a staff room with a washing machine and kettle, doctors keep an eye on a screen. It shows the movements of Russian spy drones as they zigzag in the sky above.

Welcome to Ukraine’s secret underground hospital. The facility opened in August and is the second of its kind, located in eastern Ukraine not far from the frontline and the city of Pokrovsk, in Donetsk oblast. “We are 6 metres below the earth. It’s the safest way of providing help to our injured soldiers. And it keeps medical personnel safe,” said the clinic’s surgeon, Maj Oleksandr Holovashchenko.

The stabilisation point treats 30-40 patients a day. Their conditions vary. Some have catastrophic leg injuries requiring amputations, or serious stomach wounds. Others can walk. Almost all are the victims of Russian first-person view (FPV) drones, which drop grenades with lethal accuracy. “Ninety per cent of our cases are from FPVs. We see few bullet injuries. It’s an age of drones and a different kind of war,” the surgeon said.

During one afternoon last week, three soldiers limped into the facility. The most lightly injured, 28-year-old Artem Dvorskyi, said an FPV explosion had ripped a small hole in his leg. “War is terrible. The guy next to me, Vasyl, was killed,” he said. “He fell down. Then the Russians dropped a second grenade on him.” He added: “Everything in the village is destroyed. There are drones everywhere and bodies. Ours and theirs.”

Dvorskyi said his unit spent 43 days in a forest area near Pokrovsk, which Russia has been trying to seize since last year. The only way to get to their position was on foot. All supplies arrived by quadcopter: food and water. A week after he was hurt, he walked 5km (about 3 miles), taking three hours, to where an armoured vehicle was able to pick him up. At the clinic, a medic checked his vital signs. After treatment, a nurse gave him new civilian clothes: a T-shirt and a pair of pale jeans.

Another patient, 38-year-old Pavlo Filipchuk, said a drone blast had left him with concussion. “I was in a dugout. It suddenly went dark. I couldn’t feel anything or hear anything,” he said. “I think I was lucky to survive. My cousin has been killed. There are continuous explosions.” A builder working in Lithuania, Filipchuk said he had returned to Ukraine and volunteered to fight days before Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

A third soldier, Taras Mykolaichuk, had been hit in the back. He groaned as doctors laid him on a bed, removed a bloody bandage and cleaned his two-day-old shrapnel wound. Wrapped in a foil blanket, he borrowed a mobile phone to ring his sister. “A piece of mortar hit me. It was a ricochet. I’m OK,” he told her. What were his plans now? “To get better. That will take a few months. After that, to return to my unit. Someone has to defend our country,” he said.

Since 2022, Russia has repeatedly targeted hospitals, clinics, maternity wards and ambulances. According to human rights groups, 261 health workers have been killed in nearly 2,000 attacks. The underground facility is built from four steel bunkers, with timber beams, soil and sand laid on top up to ground level. It can withstand direct hits from 152mm artillery shells and even three 8kg TNT charges dropped by drone.

The Ukrainian steel and mining company Metinvest, which financed the construction, plans to build 20 units in total. The head of Ukraine’s national security council and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said they would be “critically important for saving the lives of our military and supporting defenders on the frontline”. Metinvest described the project as the “most ambitious and challenging” it had implemented since Russia’s invasion.

Holovashchenko, the surgeon, said some wounded soldiers had to wait hours or even days before they could be evacuated because of the threat of aerial attacks. “We had two critically ill patients who arrived at 3am. I had to carry out a double amputation on one of them. His tourniquet had been on for so long there was no alternative.” How did he cope with traumatic operations? “I’ve been in medicine for 20 years. You have to focus,” he said.

SPY,Serious Stars earn first-class upgrade with 50-0 victory over Jennings County in sectional opener | WBIW,,"By Justin Sokeland

WBIW.com

NORTH VERNON – During an all-business road trip to start the postseason journey, Bedford North Lawrence’s defense got upgraded to first class.

Spending more time behind the enemy line than a spy on a covert operation, the Stars treated Jennings County’s diversionary offense like baggage handlers on the tarmac, throwing luggage around without regard to their destination. Flying BNL’s skies was not very friendly.

BNL punched its ticket to the second round of Class 4A Sectional 23 with an overwhelming performance, crushing the Panthers for the second time this season while posting a 50-0 triumph on Friday night. Brody Horton scored four touchdowns, and the Stars (7-3) recorded the second shutout in the program’s postseason history while advancing to battle Shelbyville in the semifinal.

From takeoff to landing, this was a smooth flight as BNL recorded a sectional win for the fourth straight year and for only the 15th time in 55 chances. The Stars scored during each of their first seven possessions, and the Panthers (2-8) crossed midfield only once. That’s complete dominance. Worried about a lack of respect for an overmatched opponent, after posting a 63-0 victory during the regular-season clash? BNL took this very seriously.

“Don’t take them lightly,” Horton said. “Get in and get out. It’s playoff time.”

BNL encountered no turbulence. The Stars scored fast and often, while the Panthers managed only two first downs in the first half. BNL triggered the running clock for the entire second half with another mercy-rule conquest of Jennings, beating the former Hoosier Hills Conference neighbor for the 11th straight time in the series.

“We were ready,” BNL senior lineman Brady Byers said. “We didn’t take anything for granted.”

The Stars roared down the runway for liftoff. The first drive – five plays to five different skill players – set the tone as Horton crashed home from 14 yards. Next possession, an explosive score as Dayton Kirby hit Malakai Goodman on a short swing pass, allowing Goodman to jet up the right sideline for a 40-yard, one-snap touchdown.

BNL’s next drive was set up by Driven Axson’s fumble recovery. Four plays later, Horton hammered over from 10 yards for a 21-0 lead. The Stars added three more touchdowns in the second quarter. Horton capped an eight-play march with a 3-yard dive, then Kirby connected with Parker Kern for another one-play eruption. Kern took a short pass and converted that into a 50-yard breakaway.

The final first-half drive was the longest, nine plays with Kirby hitting five straight passes. Kern caught two, including a 12-yard slant to the 1, and he finished it off with his own rare rushing touchdown for a 42-0 advantage at the half.

BNL finished the scoring on the first drive of the third quarter, with Horton exploding 57 yards past uninterested tacklers.

“On offense, our execution was almost flawless,” Tidd said. “We did a nice job. That’s what I want. Spread the ball around, get everybody going early and get in the end zone.”

Horton finished with a season-high 124 rushing yards (on only 10 carries). Kirby completed 12 of 14 passes for 149 yards and two scores. Not bad for basically a half’s work.

“We really reset the line of scrimmage every time,” Horton said. “Our line moved guys around, that’s what allowed me to have the game I had. It was the O-line.”

“Brody has really stepped it up, he’s been really good,” Tidd said. “But you can’t get there without the big boys up front. That’s one of the better games the big boys have played all year long. They’re playing good ball at the right time.”

On the other side, Jennings went without a first down on its first six possessions. Nine of its first 19 plays ended with no gain or negative yards. BNL’s only other tournament shutout was a 17-0 win over Floyd Central in 2015.

“That’s the side of the ball that brings all the juice,” Tidd said. “I’m very proud of those guys. That’s tough to do, especially in the postseason. We took care of business, did what we asked them to do. This could be the last game, you need to grow up to tell your family you gave everything you had.”

BNL will host Shelbyville in the semifinal next week. The Golden Bears (5-5) bounced Connersville 35-14 for their first sectional win since 2015.

“It’s amazing,” Horton said. “I can’t believe it’s happening.”

SPY,Wagner Group stooges jailed for warehouse arson in planned 'sabotage campaign',,"A group of Wagner Group stooges have been jailed for setting fire to a warehouse storing aid to Ukraine, as part of a planned “campaign of terrorism and sabotage” for the Russian state.

The arson attack on the industrial units in Leyton, east London, on March 20 2024, caused about £1 million in damage, put lives at risk, and took 60 firefighters to put out.

The warehouse was targeted by the terrorist Wagner Group because it was being used to supply humanitarian aid and StarLink satellite equipment to Ukraine.

Afterwards, the architect Dylan Earl set his sights on more “missions”, targeting a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnap of the owner, the wealthy Russian dissident Evgeny Chichvarkin.

The court heard Earl was a member of numerous pro-Russian propaganda channels and was motivated by “simple and ugly greed”.

On Friday, Earl and five other young men were sentenced at the Old Bailey for what the judge described as a “planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage” in the interests of the Russian state.

Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said: “This case is about the efforts of the Russian Federation to gain pernicious global influence using social media to enlist saboteurs vast distances from Moscow.

“The hidden hand of the internet delivered results because anonymous recruiter proxies operating through internet chatrooms, usually on encrypted platforms, found within the United Kingdom young men who were prepared to undergo a form of radicalisation and betray their country for what seemed easy money.

“Dylan Earl and Jake Reeves were able to muster a group who carried out a serious act of criminal damage intended by their paymasters to impair the delivery of aid to Ukraine.

“They planned further grave crimes to intimidate, undermine and frighten those speaking up for Ukraine, which were prevented through police disruption.”

She said the arson attack was not an isolated incident, as another warehouse was hit in Spain 10 days later, and Earl had discussed another potential attack in the Czech Republic.

The judge found the arson attack did have a “terrorist connection” regardless of whether or not the perpetrators knew it.

Earl, 21, and fellow organiser Jake Reeves, 24, admitted charges against them, making them the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023.

Drug dealer Earl, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, was jailed for 17 years and a further six years on extended licence for his “leading role” in the terrorist activities.

Reeves, from Croydon, south London, was handed 12 years in prison and one year on extended licence.

Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, south London, was jailed for eight years and 10 months, Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, south London, was jailed for nine years, and homeless Ugnius Asmena, 21, was jailed for seven years, after they were found guilty of carrying out the aggravated arson following an Old Bailey trial.

They were each handed a further year on extended licence by the judge, who observed the “true price” of what some might see as “easy money”.

Their case was the first to result in convictions of British criminals acting as proxies for the proscribed Wagner Group.

Drug dealer Ashton Evans, 20, from Newport, Gwent, was jailed for nine years plus a further year on extended licence after being found guilty of failing to disclose information about terrorist acts relating to the Mayfair plot.

The court had heard that Earl and Reeves never left their bedrooms as they orchestrated the arson attack for the Wagner Group which was acting on behalf of the Russian Federation.

Earl told a Wagner Group operative whom he met on Telegram that he was keen to carry out a series of “missions”, of which the Leyton fire was to be the first.

In chat, Earl’s contact, Privet Bot, instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a “manual” for his covert mission.

Earl was arrested in a B&Q car park in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his iPhone.

In a search of his home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine hydrochloride with a street value of some £34,000.

Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000.

In mitigation for Earl, Paul Hynes KC said he was “easy meat” for exploitation by the Wagner Group, as he saw the world through the “prism of online gaming”.

Mr Hynes said: “This is not a John le Carre novel. But nevertheless those who would wish the UK and other countries ill will continue to try to latch on to people like Mr Earl.”

For Reeves, Henry Blaxland KC said the evidence showed “the extent to which the Russian state and agents of the Russian state have managed to penetrate the UK through taking advantage of adolescents buried in their computers”.

He said Reeves’ judgment was “distorted” by his excessive use of the drug ketamine.

The court was told the men tasked by Earl and Reeves to carry out the arson attack in Leyton were “amateurs” motivated by the promise of money they never received..

After the sentencing, Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing London, said: “This case is a clear example of an organisation linked to the Russian state using ‘proxies’, in this case British men, to carry out very serious criminal activity in this country on their behalf.

“The ringleaders, Earl and Reeves, willingly acted as hostile agents on behalf of the Russian state.

“I am pleased that, working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service, we were able to use the new National Security Act legislation, which meant the severity of Earl and Reeves’s offending was reflected in the charges they faced.”

Frank Ferguson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This successful prosecution marks a pivotal moment in our national security efforts.

“The National Security Act has given the Crown Prosecution Service and law enforcement agencies the tools to confront emerging threats from hostile states with greater precision and force.”

Security minister Dan Jarvis said: “These sentences send a clear message: we will not tolerate hostile activity by foreign states in our country. Russia’s attempts to undermine the UK’s support for Ukraine will not succeed.

“This case has shown the strength of the National Security Act – bolstering our ability to detect, disrupt and deter such activity, making the UK an even harder target.

“To those acting for a foreign state, as the head of MI5 has said, you are disposable and you will not receive your reward, just as these individuals found out.”",Yahoo,2025-10-25T03:47:58Z,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/wagner-group-stooges-jailed-warehouse-145206770.html,0.4,2025-10-25 13:58:23.592014,,-0.615686274509804
SPY,"Six metres below ground, a hospital treats Ukrainian soldiers injured by Russian drones",,"Scrubby trees hide the entrance. A sloping wooden tunnel descends to a brightly lit reception area. There is a surgery unit, equipped with beds, cardiac monitors and ventilators. And shelves full of medical equipment, drugs and neat piles of spare clothes. In a staff room with a washing machine and kettle, doctors keep an eye on a screen. It shows the movements of Russian spy drones as they zigzag in the sky above.

Welcome to Ukraine’s secret underground hospital. The facility opened in August and is the second of its kind, located in eastern Ukraine not far from the frontline and the city of Pokrovsk, in Donetsk oblast. “We are 6 metres below the earth. It’s the safest way of providing help to our injured soldiers. And it keeps medical personnel safe,” said the clinic’s surgeon, Maj Oleksandr Holovashchenko.

The stabilisation point treats 30-40 patients a day. Their conditions vary. Some have catastrophic leg injuries requiring amputations, or serious stomach wounds. Others can walk. Almost all are the victims of Russian first-person view (FPV) drones, which drop grenades with lethal accuracy. “Ninety per cent of our cases are from FPVs. We see few bullet injuries. It’s an age of drones and a different kind of war,” the surgeon said.

During one afternoon last week, three soldiers limped into the facility. The most lightly injured, 28-year-old Artem Dvorskyi, said an FPV explosion had ripped a small hole in his leg. “War is terrible. The guy next to me, Vasyl, was killed,” he said. “He fell down. Then the Russians dropped a second grenade on him.” He added: “Everything in the village is destroyed. There are drones everywhere and bodies. Ours and theirs.”

Dvorskyi said his unit spent 43 days in a forest area near Pokrovsk, which Russia has been trying to seize since last year. The only way to get to their position was on foot. All supplies arrived by quadcopter: food and water. A week after he was hurt, he walked 5km (about 3 miles), taking three hours, to where an armoured vehicle was able to pick him up. At the clinic, a medic checked his vital signs. After treatment, a nurse gave him new civilian clothes: a T-shirt and a pair of pale jeans.

Another patient, 38-year-old Pavlo Filipchuk, said a drone blast had left him with concussion. “I was in a dugout. It suddenly went dark. I couldn’t feel anything or hear anything,” he said. “I think I was lucky to survive. My cousin has been killed. There are continuous explosions.” A builder working in Lithuania, Filipchuk said he had returned to Ukraine and volunteered to fight days before Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.

A third soldier, Taras Mykolaichuk, had been hit in the back. He groaned as doctors laid him on a bed, removed a bloody bandage and cleaned his two-day-old shrapnel wound. Wrapped in a foil blanket, he borrowed a mobile phone to ring his sister. “A piece of mortar hit me. It was a ricochet. I’m OK,” he told her. What were his plans now? “To get better. That will take a few months. After that, to return to my unit. Someone has to defend our country,” he said.

Since 2022, Russia has repeatedly targeted hospitals, clinics, maternity wards and ambulances. According to human rights groups, 261 health workers have been killed in nearly 2,000 attacks. The underground facility is built from four steel bunkers, with timber beams, soil and sand laid on top up to ground level. It can withstand direct hits from 152mm artillery shells and even three 8kg TNT charges dropped by drone.

The Ukrainian steel and mining company Metinvest, which financed the construction, plans to build 20 units in total. The head of Ukraine’s national security council and former defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said they would be “critically important for saving the lives of our military and supporting defenders on the frontline”. Metinvest described the project as the “most ambitious and challenging” it had implemented since Russia’s invasion.

Holovashchenko, the surgeon, said some wounded soldiers had to wait hours or even days before they could be evacuated because of the threat of aerial attacks. “We had two critically ill patients who arrived at 3am. I had to carry out a double amputation on one of them. His tourniquet had been on for so long there was no alternative.” How did he cope with traumatic operations? “I’ve been in medicine for 20 years. You have to focus,” he said.

Orderlies wheeled Mykolaichuk up the tunnel and into an ambulance. The vehicle was parked under a bush. He and the two other soldiers were taken to the city of Dnipro for further treatment. The subterranean medical team took a break. The hospital’s ginger cat, Vasilevs, padded up to the entrance to await the next arrivals. “We are open 24 hours a day,” Holovashchenko said. “It doesn’t stop.”",Yahoo,2025-10-25T04:00:24Z,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/six-metres-below-ground-hospital-040024928.html,0.4,2025-10-25 13:58:24.792461,,0.1215686274509804
SPY,Drama pays tribute to China's unsung heroes on the hidden frontline,,"The hit spy drama Silent Honor recently concluded its broadcast on CCTV-8 and the streaming platform iQIYI, earning impressive ratings and widespread acclaim from audiences.

As the first major TV drama focused on covert intelligence operations across the Taiwan front around the founding of New China in 1949-50, Silent Honor reveals a rarely told chapter of history from a period marked by turbulence, sacrifice and faith.

""It fills a historical gap in this subject matter,"" said Yang Bei, executive producer of the series, in an interview with China Daily.

SPY,Brigitte Macron's never-ending fake news nightmare,,"Daniel Nardello arranged to meet in a discreet lounge at the Lutetia, his Parisian base, this September. The luxury hotel and background jazz had the feel of a spy movie. It is rare for the 68-year-old American to come out of the shadows. Dressed in a loose-fitting suit with a neatly trimmed goatee, the former federal prosecutor in New York is now a high-end private investigator hired by companies and law firms to gather dirt on their adversaries in legal proceedings.

Business has been good for Nardello, and his firm employs around 110 people – former FBI agents, ex-judges and lawyers – from Washington to Dubai, London to Singapore. Nardello & Co. is even expected to set up shop in Paris soon, and the company already has a particularly prestigious couple among its clients there: Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron.

For several months now, Nardello's investigators have been looking into the ""Jean-Michel Trogneux case,"" a fake news story claiming that France's first lady is a transgender woman and accusing her of actually being her brother, Jean-Michel, an 80-year-old man who does really exist. For four years now, the Elysée Palace has been unable to shake off the rumor first made popular by a self-proclaimed ""amateur journalist"" and medium in a December 2021 video. Four years of denials, outraged statements and silence have not managed to calm the madness of social media. On the contrary, the racket now resonates around the world.

SPY,"Despite stellar performance, BTS leaves Grammys empty-handed again",,"Wearing all-black suits, the members of BTS delivered a stellar performance at the 64th Grammy Awards held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Sunday. While Jin was operating a complicated-looking machine full of buttons, Jungkook made his grand entrance onto the stage by descending from the ceiling on a rope. Meanwhile, V whispered something into Olivia Rodrigo’s ear, then took out a square card and threw it toward the stage.

The other members of BTS then joined Jungkook on the stage to perform their hit song “Butter.” The choreography looked like something right out of a spy movie, suspenseful and suave as a “Mission Impossible” stunt. Their breakdancing moves and jacket-air-guitar playing also received cheers from the audience. It was clear to see why they got a standing ovation after their performance, which set the bar high for the rest of the night.

However, despite their stellar performance and amazing track record, BTS was once again unable to take home a Grammy. Although the boy band was nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, the award ultimately went to Doja Cat and SZA.

Both Doja Cat and SZA cried as they received their awards, thanking their fans for supporting them. BTS smiled and applauded from their seats in the audience.

After the award ceremony was over, Jimin went on V’s live stream on Naver and told fans that he thought he would be able to reward the ARMY — what BTS fans refer to themselves as collectively — by winning the Grammy that night, but was somewhat disappointed with the results.

RM also had a similar reaction, saying, “I can’t deny that I don’t feel great.” Suga mentioned that, since it was already the group’s second time to be nominated for a Grammy, “there is nothing to be sad about.”

Among the four main awards given out that night, Song of the Year and Record of the Year went to Silk Sonic for their song “Leave the Door Open,” Album of the Year went to Jon Batiste for “We Are,” while the Best New Artist was picked up by Olivia Rodrigo. Jazz musician Jon Batiste was the recipient of the most Grammy Awards this year with five trophies.

Silk Sonic, a collaboration between Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, won four, while American pop music star Olivia Rodrigo took home three trophies. Paak, a Korean American rapper who inherited his last name from his mother, who was adopted from South Korea, said, “We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point. But in the industry, they call that a clean sweep!” he said, referring to the many awards the duo won that night.

Despite all the celebrations and laughs, however, the Grammys have long been criticized for their conservative tendencies that favor English-speaking white male singers. It is the oldest among the three major American music awards, but it has been accused of being “so white” for not paying more attention to diversity. However, as if to reflect these criticisms, the four main awards this year went to people of color or women.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also made a surprise appearance through a video and delivered a message of peace to those at the Grammys. He said that, instead of music flowing in Ukraine, it was now only the silence of death that was dominating.

“Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded, in hospitals,” he said, pleading with the world to help Ukrainians not to lose any more music in their lives.

He implored those listening to “tell the truth about war. On your social networks. On TV. Support us in any way you can. Any. But not silence.”

After the message, American singer-songwriter John Legend and Ukrainian singer Mika Newton sang “Free,” a song about their desire to end the war and to have peace. The screen behind them showed images of the war in Ukraine.

SPY,Crunchyroll Just Made Weekdays Much Scarier For Anime Fans,,"October is a great month for horror anime, lending itself perfectly to the Halloween-inspired Soul Eater or Blood Lad. Most horror fans have a special love for Halloween, but there is more to the horror genre than that. Anime fans searching for a more tender exploration of human darkness within the Fall 2025 lineup need to give This Monster Wants to Eat Me a chance. This Monster Wants to Eat Me is an ongoing Crunchyroll series with a mature and emotional take on horror, one that contrasts sharply with many of the season's other offerings.

Not only is the horror genre slimmer than the options for slice-of-life and isekai anime, but This Monster Wants to Eat Me makes horror a little less about fighting monsters and more about the grim despair of losing the will to live. If fans want to mix some of this psychological horror into their Fall 2025 viewing experience, they can check out This Monster Wants to Eat Me on Thursdays, right after the light-hearted adventures of Campfire Cooking in ANother World With My Absurd Skill on Wednesdays and right before Spy x Family on Saturdays.

This Monster Wants to Eat Me Focuses on the Daily Reality of Human Suffering

Some horror anime use gruesome spectacles, monsters, and the supernatural to drive home the intensity of what is happening. Anime adaptations of author Junji Ito's works do just that with the body horror of spirals and even rotting fish on strange mechanical legs, while Another is about a violent curse on a certain classroom and Angels of Death is like a haunted house adventure of sorts. In-your-face gore and nightmarish creatures are one way to deliver horror, but it's hardly the only way, and not everyone is keen on that anyhow. A slightly gentler but no less unnerving approach to horror is to dive into the darkest aspects of the human psyche, a kind of horror that scares viewers because it hits so close to home. Fans might even see themselves in a character haunted by trauma, loss, or despair, which can be more effective than any hatchet-wielding serial killer or malevolent ghost.

This Monster Wants to Eat Me may not present itself as a traditional horror anime, to the point it may be fairer to call this a supernatural drama anime, or a mild example of a psychological horror anime. It's not quite the same as a legend like Monster, but This Monster Wants to Eat Me will definitely chill Crunchyroll subscribers who get to know protagonist Hinako Yaotose and her woes. It's a high school slice-of-life anime where the life isn't even meant to be lived anymore, and that's the unsettling part.

This Monster Wants to Eat Me does involve yokai such as Shiori the mermaid, which deliver the physical horror and supernatural aspect while also fueling some action scenes to up the stakes. Above all, though, This Monster Wants to Eat Me is about one's own inner demons, the soul-crushing despair that comes with unresolved trauma. What Hinako experienced, and her self-destructive reaction to it, will certainly horrify viewers who have been there, or those who know someone who has. Hinako hasn't emotionally recovered from the accidental death of her parents and older brother, and now, she wishes to join them in the afterlife -- if there even is such a thing. Most stories are rooted in the fact the hero wants to live and accomplish something in life, but Hinako feels the grim opposite in This Monster Wants to Eat Me.

It remains to be seen how well the anime handles this concept in the long run, but at least for now, fans of psychological horror and drama may find themselves hooked by Hinako's delicate relationship with her own life. She's ready for it all to end, but she will also survive long enough to befriend her mermaid companion Shiori, who will protect Hinako from other yokai while also preparing to devour Hinako when the time is right. It feels like a ticking time bomb of a friendship, a truly unnerving twist on the usual paradigm of girls becoming besties in their carefree high school days. On top of that, Hinako and Shiori just might fall in love while Hinako's friend Miko feels ever more jealous, creating tension about whether this yuri romance will inspire Hinako to survive no matter what, or just make things more painful as Hinako's life is eventually ripped away.

Other Anime Also Explore the Pain of Living Without a Purpose

Among other things, This Monster Wants to Eat Me is a personal drama about the struggle of finding the will to live after suffering immense loss or trauma. It's easy for an anime lead to embrace life and make the most of it when everything is in place, such as an athlete who has a team, sport, and friends, to push them along. It's one thing for a character to feel just a little lost or overwhelmed by life until a friend, rival, or lover kicks their adventure into high tear. But it's another thing for a character to be ready to die, or at least throw away their seemingly ruined life, and then begin the bitter uphill battle to find meaning once again.

A variety of notable anime series share common ground with This Monster Wants to Eat Me, and none of them are horror anime, reinforcing the notion that This Monster Wants to Eat Me is horror-lite at most. Anime titles like these will haunt viewers with main characters who have abandoned the desire to live on, or at least, those who feel their life is an aimless, joyless gray haze. One of them is the famed Your Lie in April, where Kousei Arima trudges wearily through his junior high life after losing his connection to piano music due to personal trauma, only for Kaori Miyazono to inspire and heal him with the power of friendship and music. Kaori may lose her own life, but Kousei restores his own, and that makes the ending so inspiring and bittersweet.

Undead Unluck may be radically different than This Monster Wants to Eat Me on most levels, but these two anime do share the idea of a protagonist who is ready to die, only for a bizarre stranger to show up and support them. Fuuko Izumo lost her parents due to her Unluck ability as a Negator, while her new friend Andy has lived so long as an immortal being, he is desperate to rest in the grave at last. Together, they will find a new purpose and joy in life while fighting together, giving the otherwise carefree Undead Unluck a remarkably morbid edge.",CBR,2025-10-25T02:26:58Z,https://www.cbr.com/crunchyroll-this-monster-wants-to-eat-me-best-weekday-horror-anime/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:58:55.038179,,-0.1450980392156863
SPY,"Alien: Earth Season 2 Brings ""Problems"" for Wendy & Friends: Hawley",,"If a second season happens, Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley explains how Wendy and friends will have some serious ""problems"" to deal with.

Though no official word on a second season of FX Networks and Showrunner Noah Hawley's Sydney Chandler-starring Alien: Earth has come down yet, Hawley is offering some insights into where he wants to take things and what he wants to explore should the series continue. Regarding Wendy's (Chandler) final words of empowerment at the end of the first season finale, Hawley shared that it's now about showing the reality of what that means – and how there are a lot of folks looking to get in her way. ""That moment of, 'Now we rule,' is such an exhilarating moment for the audience. And then the question is… well, it was an exhilarating moment when Dustin Hoffman ran out of the church and they got on the bus [in The Graduate]. But what comes after?"" Hawley shared with Empire. ""The [Weyland-Yutani] ships are coming, and all they have is problems.""

Speaking of Weyland-Yutani, Hawley would also like a chance to dig deeper into his future Earth's societal structure and how corporations have become the new political parties. ""I'm interested in exploring the corporate politics of it. As we've seen, there's an irresistible gravitational pull toward monopoly that corporations and billionaires have. There's a bit of 'Game of Thrones' to the corporate world that feels interesting to me,"" he shared. But at the center of the series is Wendy and the team, though viewers can expect the series to live up to its global name. ""I do think this story of these children's autonomy continues to be the heart of the show, but 'Alien' is always about levels of containment. The island is a level of containment, and what happens when you expand past that level? Ultimately, the show is called 'Alien: Earth.' I know that, given the canon, I can't blow up the Earth, but I do think that containment is going to be very hard to maintain,"" Hawley revealed.

Set in 2120 (two years before the events of the classic 1979 film), five corporations – Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold – wield the power of nations, and proprietary advancements in technology provide the promise of a new tomorrow. When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a horrifying discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. As members of the crash recovery crew search for survivors in the wreckage, they encounter mysterious, predatory life forms more terrifying than they could have ever imagined. With this new threat unlocked, the search crew must fight for survival – and what they choose to do with this discovery could change planet Earth as they know it.

Okay, so you know, let’s talk about, we’ll go through history, right? Let’s take a look, the top problem facing the United States is economic. In the average midterm election, it’s 35%. It’s 35%, look at where we are now: Again, it’s 24%. It is lower. Fewer Americans right now are saying the top problem is economic than historically have said that the top problem is economic.

So it’s not only that the top problem being economic is lower than we were at this time last year. It is lower than we have historically been, despite all the news about how the economy is supposedly softening. So you just look at these numbers, and you just go to yourself, wait a minute, there’s something going on here with the American public, whereby you’re getting all this economic news, but yet the percentage of Americans who say the top problem is economic has actually been falling, and is lower than it normally is.

It explains why Democrats aren’t gaining any ground in the generic ballot despite less-than-stellar economic indicators. However, if voters remain satisfied with the economy, they may start prioritizing other issues, perhaps including those which favors Dems. It’s worth watching, but I’d still rather be in this posiition than its opposite.

Free Beacon: European security services are investigating a former Politico reporter for working as a Chinese spy.

The unnamed reporter, who is based in Brussels, Belgium, ""is suspected of using their position as a journalist to cultivate potential targets working in Brussels-based international organisations, including by making sexual overtures towards officials in these institutions,"" European news site Euractiv reported, citing officials from three intelligence agencies.

It is unclear whether the reporter's departure from Politico stemmed from the espionage investigation. A Politico spokesman said European authorities have not contacted the company and that it ""does not comment on personnel departures as these are confidential personnel matters,"" according to Euractiv.

Ed: I imagine Eric Swalwell was unavailable for comment.

Ed: Time to get the UN out of Gaza. And, for that matter, to get them out of southern Lebanon, too. UNIFIL has done nothing but act as Hezbollah's human shields. The UN is the single worst entity to deal with ""peacekeeping"" missions.

Daily Caller: “Trump did a better job. I don’t like Trump, but we should have a secure border and it ain’t that hard to do. Biden didn’t do it, those before him did not do it. We should have a secure border, period,” said Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on an Oct. 22 episode of the Tim Dillon Show.

Far-left commentator and former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan rebuked Sanders for the remarks, writing on X on Oct. 23: “This may be the single worst thing Bernie Sanders has ever said, and I say this as a long-time Bernie admirer. Praising Trump for his *border policies*? Endorsing lazy rightwing talking points about Biden and border security, and nations not existing without borders? Sheesh.”

Ed: Having an MSNBC host talking about “lazy talking points” is akin to Dollar Bill Jefferson or Gold Bar Bob Menendez decry corruption in American government. The lazy talking point in question was the claim that Trump prevented the securing of the border by opposing the Biden-Harris bill that would have thrown the gates open permanently. It took only weeks to secure the border after Trump took office without any additional legislation.

Off the Press: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered an aircraft carrier strike group currently stationed in Europe to the Caribbean region amid a massive buildup of US military forces in the region.

The Gerald R. Ford strike group and its associated air wing are being sent to “dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and counter narco-terrorism,” Pentagon Press Secretary Sean Parnell said in a statement posted on X.

The buildup of US forces has raised questions about the Trump administration’s intent in the region. The administration has said repeatedly that the military presence is part of a counter-drug trafficking campaign, but President Donald Trump has also been weighing strikes inside Venezuela itself as part of a broader strategy aimed at weakening leader Nicolas Maduro, CNN has reported.

Ed: This doesn’t raise any serious questions about Trump’s intent. His intent is to send a message to transational drug cartels that he takes the war on drugs literally, and that he’s imposing a “don’t f*** with us” policy. Someone (I can’t recall who) called it the Donroe Doctrine, which is both amusing and accurate.

===

Ed: What should we call this state? Minnesofraud? Maxi-frauda? Fraudasota? At least they have a new state flag that pairs up well with the new era of fraud in the ex-pat community there, and in Democrat circles. (I'm leaning toward Maxi-frauda, but YMMV.)

According to an EXPLOSIVE report from The Times, Chinese and Russian spies are using ""sex warfare"" to infiltrate the U.S. tech world with a mission to spy and steal our secrets.

How far are these women willing to go?

All the way.

Ed: Again, Eric Swalwall is likely unavailable for comment. I’m not sure how seriously to take this as a new threat or even much of a real threat, since China in particular has more effective means to steal tech. If they’re using Sparrows (IYKYK), maybe the US has finally put up more effective defenses to those methods. It sounds like a pitch to get young male nerds even more enthusiastic about the tech industry.

Don Surber: The wing was gone by Thursday. Nevertheless, Politico reported, “A Virginia couple has gone to court to try to block President Donald Trump from proceeding with demolition of the White House’s East Wing to make way for a new ballroom.”

I expect Judge Boasberg to get the case and demand Trump build a time machine to get the East Wing back.

The East Wing was not part of the original White House. Teddy Roosevelt added it in 1902. I cannot find public outcry against that.

A republic that survived the Obama basketball court will withstand a ballroom nearly twice the size of the rest of the White House.

Ed: This space will entertain more than just the president and a few NBA players. The White House cannot host state dinners with its existing structures, forcing the use of tents, which are fine for weddings but hardly fit for significant diplomatic events. But don’t take my word for it….

Jonathan Turley: Despite calls for many Democratic politicians and pundits to temper their inflammatory rhetoric, this week has proven a further escalation in this dangerous form of rage rhetoric. DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC’s “The Beat” that “we may be nearing” the moment when “elections don’t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to “forcefully rise up.” With political violence on the rise, these leaders are clearly fueling the mob in hopes that they and their party can ride the wave of rage back into power. History suggests that it is a foolish delusion. Today’s revolutionaries quickly become tomorrow’s reactionaries.

Ed: Worth reading in its entirety, as is usual with Professor Turley. As you might imagine, Robespierre makes an appearance in his argument, largely because of the symbol used in these No Kings protests.

SPY,Regressing LSU Tigers Defense Tasked With Slowing Down Elite Texas A&M Athletes,,"The LSU Tigers defense took a major step backward last weekend and will be tested again against the Texas A&M Aggies, which boasts the best slate of athletes the Tigers have seen this season.

LSU's vaunted secondary was able to slow down the Vanderbilt Commodores' passing game last week, allowing just 51 yards outside of the numbers.

It didn't matter, though, because they couldn't keep up with anyone in space. Both the between the numbers passing, 10-of-11 for 109 yards, and rushing attack dominated.

Harold Perkins was playing out of position and wasn't able to adjust. LSU as a whole had 12 missed tackles. Six of those were from PJ Woodland and A.J. Haulcy.

The middle of the field was a nightmare for the Tigers and that is where a large bulk of the Aggies' passing offense comes from.

Marcel Reed is 77-of-118 for 1,095 yards with six touchdowns and two interceptions when passing between the numbers this season.

Reed has elite athletes to work with, which could become an issue if LSU cannot adjust to what killed them last week.

There are four names that the Tigers will need to focus on slowing down, outside of Reed. Reuben Owens and Le'Veon Moss are both nearing 400 yards on the ground. Mario Craver and Kevin Concepcion would both lead LSU in receiving by nearly 500 yards, with the former leading all SEC receivers with 674 yards.

Starting with the rushing attack, Texas A&M ranks No. 30 nationally with 196.7 rushing yards per game. Just around 16 yards less than the Commodores, who finished with 239 yards and three touchdowns.

Owens has 296 yards and three scores this season. He's forced 235 of those came after contact and he's forced 10 missed tackles. He is 5-foot-11, 216-pounds and quick-footed. He's also the best pass-catching back on the roster.

Moss has 389 yards and six touchdowns. He was a track star in high school and will punish the defense if they let him get to the second level.

Then there's Reed, who had his breakout game on the ground last year against the Tigers. Perkins must spy him more, which is harder to do without Whit Weeks.

If LSU can step up in the run game, then they will have the receivers to worry about.

Craver is the one to watch, as he has dominated the middle of the field this season working out of the slot. He has 31 catches on 39 targets for 551 yards between the numbers this season.

The Tigers are going to have to be much better against the things that lost them the game last week. This late in the season, adjustments are harder to come by, but something will have to change.",Roundtable.io Network,2025-10-25T00:55:55Z,https://roundtable.io/sports/ncaa/lsu/opinion/regressing-lsu-tigers-defense-tasked-with-slowing-down-elite-texas-a-m-athletes,0.4,2025-10-25 13:59:01.351858,,-0.07450980392156858

The United States will send an aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America, part of a major escalation of its military presence in the region, amid speculation about a possible effort to overthrow the Venezuelan government.

A U.S. military spokesman said Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford and five destroyers from its accompanying strike group to Latin America.

Recommended 3-item story listend of list

The enhanced presence of U.S. forces in the USSOUTHCOM area of ​​responsibility will strengthen the United States' ability to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that undermine the security and prosperity of the United States as well as our security in the Western Hemisphere, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a social media post.

But the deployment suggests a level of military firepower far beyond the Trump administration's stated goals in combating drug trafficking, and comes as the United States takes an increasingly hard line against Caracas, a longtime target of American ire.

The United States already has about 6,000 sailors and Marines in the region aboard eight warships, which will now be joined by the USS Gerald Ford and the five destroyers in its strike group, as well as an additional 4,500 personnel. The carrier is currently in the Mediterranean Sea and it is unclear when it will arrive in Latin America.

Trump said last week that he had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), America's international spy agency, to conduct operations in Venezuela, and hinted that attacks on Venezuelan territory could soon follow.

As a pretext for these moves, the Trump administration has advanced the baseless claim that President Nicolas Maduro's government is coordinating with criminal groups to invade the United States through drugs and immigration. Venezuela plays a minor role in the global drug trade, and internal U.S. intelligence assessments have found little evidence to support the claim that Maduro's government controls criminal groups.

Since early September, the United States has carried out an increasing number of military strikes in the region against ships it says were carrying drugs from Venezuela, often without corroborating evidence. U.N. officials and international law experts said the strikes were a flagrant violation of U.S. and international law and amounted to extrajudicial killings.

The Maduro government has said it will respond forcefully to any U.S. attempt to overthrow the government.

Interpret it however you like: the armed forces will not allow a government here that is submissive to the interests of the United States, Foreign Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Friday.

It is the most significant military threat in the last 100 years, he added. We do not want war, we want peace.

The United States has so far rejected calls for a reduction in tensions, with Trump responding in the affirmative last week when asked about reports that Maduro had offered significant concessions but appeared to brush them aside.

SPY,Men sentenced over London arson attack masterminded by Russia as part of a wider sabotage campaign,,"LONDON — A British judge on Friday sentenced five men for their roles in an arson attack in London that authorities say was masterminded by Russian intelligence as part of a wider campaign of sabotage and disruption.

Their sentences ranged from seven to 17 years in prison. Another man was sentenced for not disclosing information about a plot to burn a London restaurant.

Five men were involved in a plot to set fire to a warehouse in east London in March 2024 that contained satellite communication devices destined for Ukraine.

The judge said that the arson — organized on behalf of the Wagner paramilitary group — was part of a planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage in the Russian state's interests. It was likely linked, she said, to another arson attack against a warehouse in Spain.

The fire is one of at least 25 arson or explosives plots across Europe linked to Russia by Western officials that The Associated Press has documented since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022.

European intelligence officials told the AP that the risk of death or serious injury is rising as saboteurs directed by Russia set fires near homes and businesses, plant explosives or build bombs.

Prosecutor Duncan Penny said that the attack was “part of a series of European-wide sabotage operations.”

Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said the case “is about the efforts of the Russian Federation to gain pernicious global influence using social media to enlist saboteurs vast distances from Moscow.”

The sentences were the first a British court imposed for violating the National Security Act, which was introduced in 2023 to address threats from foreign states including espionage and sabotage.

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke about the arson attack as he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in London.

“We will not tolerate this hostile activity,” he said, telling Zelenskyy, “your security is our security.”

Arson and kidnapping plots

Dylan Earl — the British man who arranged the arson — was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Cheema-Grubb said that he was a member of numerous pro-Russia propaganda channels on Telegram before he was recruited.

The arson in East London caused 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) in damage to a warehouse owned by a Ukrainian couple who shipped Starlink satellite communication devices to Ukraine. The devices are often used by the Ukrainian military.

The couple also own a business on the outskirts of Madrid that was set on fire 10 days after the attack in London, a counterterrorism officer from the Metropolitan Police told the court in a statement. The methods used “strongly” suggest that the two incidents may be linked, they said.

Earl, 21, and his co-conspirators also talked about burning down London businesses owned by Evgeny Chichvarkin — a Russian tycoon who delivered supplies to Ukraine — and kidnapping him.

Earl also tried to pay someone identified as a serving British soldier for intelligence for the Wagner Group — a mercenary organization whose operations were taken over by Russia’s Defense Ministry in 2023.

A day after the London arson, he also discussed burning down a warehouse in the Czech Republic and, later, kidnapping another billionaire and collecting bank card details on European residents.

Earl’s defense attorney, Paul Hynes, painted him as a “sad” fantasist who boasted to his Russian recruiter that he could be “the best spy you have ever seen” as well as of having ties to international criminal gangs.

Hynes said that Earl had a difficult childhood and saw the world through the “delusional prism of online gaming.”

He communicated on Telegram with Privet Bot — an account which posted multiple times in a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner Group, asking for people to join the battle against the West.

The Metropolitan Police on Friday released an image of Earl holding up his passport to confirm his identity to Privet Bot — who likely was linked to Russian military intelligence, the court heard.

Privet Bot asked Earl to “get access to bank accounts containing money destined for Ukraine,” including Russian assets frozen after President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country.

“We need those who are our kindred spirit,” the Russian recruiter said.

Earl told his psychiatrist that he received 5,000 euros ($5,815) in cryptocurrency for the attack and Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said that he was motivated by “simple and ugly greed.”

Patterns across Europe

Police and intelligence services are grappling with similar attacks — including online recruitment — across Europe.

Polish authorities have investigated multiple arson attacks on shopping centers, industrial areas and apartment buildings which show how Russian operatives often “follow the same pattern” in plots across Europe, said Jacek Dobrzyński spokesperson for Poland’s security minister.

In 2024, a Colombian man was directed on the Telegram messaging app to set fire to two warehouses in Poland and then to travel to the Czech capital, Prague, to set fire to public buses.

Like Earl, he was given the location for the fires, instructions on how and when to set them and told to provide video evidence to Russia’s intelligence services to get paid, Dobrzyński told the AP.

The goal of the arson attacks is to “intimidate people,” create conflict and to undermine European societies and support for Ukraine, Dobrzyński said. It’s also about testing the response of law enforcement and — because the plots often involve multiple people and lines of investigation — draining police resources, he said.

Five men were sentenced Friday alongside Earl for their roles in the plots.

Both Earl and his co-conspirator Jake Reeves, 24, “willingly acted as hostile agents"" for Russia, said Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing at the Metropolitan Police. Reeves was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

But Nii Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 23, and Ugnius Asmena, 20, didn’t know they were working for Russia. They were found guilty of aggravated arson and sentenced to nine years; eight years, 10 months, and seven years in prison, respectively. Ashton Evans, 20, was sentenced to nine years in prison for failing to disclose information about terrorist acts.

The sentences, Cheema-Grubb said, “must send a signal,” that engaging in online activity which undermines the security of the U.K. is “not worthwhile.”",Newsday,2025-10-24T14:54:39Z,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/britain-russia-arson-attack-sentences-m84669,0.4,2025-10-25 13:59:26.660254,,-0.4117647058823529
SPY,"The 10 Greatest Action Thrillers of All Time, Ranked",,"The action thriller genre is arguably the backbone of cinema. The films are exhilarating in theaters and also still exciting to watch at home. It's a genre where danger and emotional stakes collide in the most visceral way possible. These films are not just about the set pieces, but they're also about the characters pushed to their breaking point. The best action thrillers do not forget about their main characters, on top of suspenseful storytelling and explosions or car chases.

Here, we take a look at the greatest action thrillers of all time. From the sleek precision of The Bourne Ultimatum to the intense nonstop action of The Raid, these movies showcase how action provides both thrills and suspense. They span decades and continents, from Hollywood classics to international powerhouses, but they all share a mastery of filmmaking to keep audiences glued to the screen.

10 ‘Infernal Affairs’ (2002)

Infernal Affairs is set in Hong Kong’s criminal underworld, where undercover cop Chan (Tony Leung) infiltrates a powerful triad organization, while Lau (Andy Lau), a mole within the police force, secretly feeds information back to the gang. Neither man knows the other’s identity, and both live in constant tension of being discovered.

Infernal Affairs is exceptional in its psychological precision. Directors Andrew Lau and Alan Mak elevated a cops-and-criminals thriller into an exploration of identity and morality. The film thrives on tension from the set pieces that are based on the characters' dynamics, while Tony Leung and Andy Lau give career-defining performances. Its influence was so profound that Martin Scorsese remade it as The Departed, but the original remains leaner, sharper, and more tragic.

9 ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’ (2007)

In The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues his relentless quest to uncover his true identity while still being haunted by fragments of his past. From London to Tangier to New York, he pieces together the final clues that lead him to Treadstone and Blackbriar, a continuation of the covert program that created him.

The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best modern spy thrillers that blends sharp writing, gritty realism, and tightly choreographed action. Paul Greengrass’s signature handheld cinematography and rapid editing style immerse the viewer in every chase and fight, while Matt Damon's performance is the best in the franchise, as he anchors the chaos with intensity. The tight structure and globe-trotting scale pushed the action genre toward a grittier, more authentic aesthetic that would influence everything action movies. It’s a rare third entry that becomes the series' best and also one of the best in the action thriller genre.

8 ‘Sicario’ (2015)

Set in the backdrop of the U.S.–Mexico drug war, Sicario follows FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited by a shadowy government task force led by handler Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio del Toro). Her straightforward mission to take down a cartel soon unravels into layers of deception and moral compromise, where justice is murky and goes against everything Kate believes.

Denis Villeneuve turns Sicario into a deep character study rather than a simple cartel drama ala Breaking Bad. Every scene is crafted with surgical precision, like the tense Juárez convoy to the silent night raid, exemplifying Roger Deakins’ breathtaking, Oscar-nominated cinematography. Emily Blunt’s subdued performance captures the emotional toll of witnessing systemic violence, while Del Toro’s enigmatic character steals every frame he’s in. Sicario stands out for its restraint; it's an unsettling, beautifully crafted action thriller that dares to ask difficult questions.

7 ‘The Raid’ (2011)

A rookie cop named Rama (Iko Uwais) joins a SWAT team tasked with storming a high-rise controlled by a ruthless crime lord in The Raid. The tactical operation quickly becomes a desperate fight for survival as the team is ambushed by violent enforcers on each level. Helped by his commander Jaka (Joe Taslim) and also Andi (Donny Alamsyah), his estranged brother who works for the crime boss, he must take down every henchman, including the feral and virtually unbeatable Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian), to finish his mission.

Directed by Gareth Evans, this Indonesian import changed the landscape of the action genre forever. Even by focusing on the stunts and less on the story, the film managed to be wholly entertaining from beginning to end. Evans plunges the audience straight into chaos, relying on relentless pacing, claustrophobic camerawork, and thunderous sound design to create a pervasive sense of danger. The action choreography is simply breathtaking, inspiring countless movies like John Wick and setting a new bar in the action genre.

6 ‘Speed’ (1994)

Speed follows LAPD officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) as he races to save passengers trapped on a city bus rigged with a bomb that will detonate if the speed drops below 50 miles per hour. With the help of a passenger, Annie (Sandra Bullock), they must navigate through chaos and traffic while outsmarting the bomber (Dennis Hopper). Speed itself is inspired by the Japanese film The Bullet Train, which has a similar conceit on a bullet train.

Speed is such an enduring action thriller for its perfect balance of tension and pacing. Director Jan De Bont, a cinematographer turned director, captures the action with kinetic clarity, grounding the spectacle in believable physicality while keeping the camera locked to the characters. Reeves’ charm and Bullock’s relatability make them instantly likable leads — it's no surprise fans still want another Reeves-Bullock pairing — and Hopper’s manic villainy adds the right amount of unpredictability. Every sequence, especially the famous bus jump, is engineered for maximum suspense without losing its human core. Speed is one of the best '90s action movies with its lean storytelling and inventive action.

5 ‘The Dark Knight’ (2008)

Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight follows Batman (Christian Bale) as he faces off against the Joker (Heath Ledger), a sociopathic anarchist who seeks chaos to expose Gotham’s true nature. Batman teams up with Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to restore order, but the Joker's schemes push their ideals to their breaking point.

The Dark Knight gave new life to the superhero genre by blending in the action-thriller aspect, making it much closer to a Michael Mann film than the usual superhero spectacle. The set pieces are executed with grounded realism and impeccable craft, while Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning, unpredictable yet hypnotic performance is the film’s soul. Nolan gives the film philosophical weight that differentiates it from a typical blockbuster. The Dark Knight reshaped the expectations for what action thrillers and superhero movies could be. It could be smart, morally complex, and emotionally engaging.

4 ‘The French Connection’ (1971)

The French Connection follows detectives Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), who stumble onto a massive heroin smuggling operation led by French criminal Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). Their investigation brings them from small-time dealers in Brooklyn bars to an international drug pipeline that stretches from Marseille to Manhattan.

William Friedkin's The French Connection sets itself apart as one of the greatest action thrillers ever made for its realism and energy. Hackman’s Oscar-winning performance captures both the charisma and recklessness of a man consumed by his mission, and Friedkin’s direction exposes the ugly, procedural grind of police work. The tension doesn’t come from nonstop action but from an atmosphere of relentless unease, and the legendary car chase remains one of the most visceral action sequences ever filmed. The French Connection paved the way for the modern crime thriller, inspiring generations of filmmakers to chase that same dangerous authenticity.

3 ‘The Fugitive’ (1993)

The Fugitive follows Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a prominent vascular surgeon who is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. During a transfer to prison, a catastrophic train crash allows him to escape, and he tries to prove his innocence while evading relentless U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Kimble follows clues from his wife’s mysterious final words and pieces together a trail leading to the real killer.

The Fugitive is a benchmark in action thrillers thanks to its seamless blend of suspense, character work, and spectacle. Andrew Davis crafts the film with precise pacing, with every set piece giving intense action without losing the plot. Harrison Ford's performance is amazing as a man forced into survival, while Tommy Lee Jones' scene-stealing performance earned him an Oscar and also a movie sequel centering on his character. The Fugitive's technical achievements remain impressive examples of practical effects and staging, cementing it as one of the most compelling and influential thrillers of the 1990s.

2 ‘Die Hard’ (1988)

Die Hard centers on NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) as he flies to Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife at her company’s Christmas Eve party in the towering Nakatomi Plaza. The party is interrupted when Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his heavily armed crew seize the building, taking hostages and executing a heist. Trapped alone and outgunned, McClane uses his wits and resourcefulness to sabotage the terrorists’ plan.

Die Hard is celebrated as a blueprint for modern action thrillers, which influenced an entire sub-genre of ""Die Hard in a certain place"". Bruce Willis’ portrayal of McClane redefined the action hero who is vulnerable, sarcastic, and human, while Alan Rickman’s performance as the charismatic yet ruthless Hans Gruber belongs in the pantheon of great movie villains. Beyond its tightly choreographed action and memorable one-liners, Die Hard also has a great screenplay filled with well-written supporting characters that make the film better than its peers. The film is a cultural touchstone and has spawned four sequels.

1 ‘Heat’ (1995)

Michael Mann’s Heat follows master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) as he plans one last major heist while being relentlessly pursued by dedicated LAPD detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino). As McCauley’s crew meticulously prepares, Hanna tracks the criminals obsessively, which leads to a tense cat-and-mouse game that becomes personal between them.",Collider,2025-10-25T00:30:17Z,https://collider.com/best-action-thrillers-ranked/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:59:31.736390,,0.2470588235294118
SPY,7 Burning Questions I Have After 'The Diplomat' Season 3 Finale,,"Spoiler Alert: This list contains spoilers for 'The Diplomat' Season 3.If you thought The Diplomat couldn't get any messier, brace yourself before you start Season 3. What started as a tense exploration of foreign relations between the United States and the United Kingdom has since spiraled into full-blown chaos: complete with stolen nukes, moral backstabbing, and the kind of romantic entanglements that could start wars. By the time the season ended, it wasn't just global world order that looked unstable—it was every relationship, friendship, and alliance on the show.

Kate Wyler's (Keri Russell) entire career now hangs by a thread, the American government has never looked more untrustworthy, and Prime Minister Nichol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) is one humiliation away from detonating the world stage. Yet amid all the deception and diplomacy, The Diplomat remains as addictive as ever, proving itself to be one of the best political thrillers of all time. But with so many threads dangling, I can't help but wonder: where does everyone go from here? So, while we wait for Season 4, here are the main questions I have going forward.

1 Can Kate's Ambassadorship Survive the Betrayal?

By the end of Season 3, Kate finds herself at the epicenter of a geopolitical nightmare. The revelation that her husband, Hal Wyler (Rufus Sewell), the newly minted Vice President, and President Grace Penn (Allison Janney) orchestrated the theft of Russia's nuclear weapon behind the UK's back detonates like a diplomatic bomb. Not only does this expose a staggering level of deception within the supposed ""special relationship"", but it also puts Kate's entire ambassadorship (and integrity) at risk.

Kate's greatest strength has always been her ability to bridge divides, especially amid the impulsivity of Prime Minister Trowbridge's government. But this time, she's caught between loyalty to her country and loyalty to the morals of a true civil servant. Can she possibly repair an alliance that Washington itself sabotaged? Worse still, can she survive politically when both sides might see her as a liability? With Season 4 likely exploring the fallout, Kate may face an impossible choice: fight to restore the very alliance that betrayed her, or walk away from diplomacy altogether.

2 Will Trowbridge Build a Diplomatic Channel With Russia?

No one knows fury like a scorned Prime Minister Trowbrigde. At least, that's what fans have grown to recognize whenever the man is faced with moments of humiliation and betrayal. From choking out Margaret Roylin (Celia Imrie) to almost making a secret deal with China, Trowbridge is undoubtedly the most reactive politician on the show—which only makes us tremble at the prospects of what is to come.

By secretly stealing the Poseidon, the U.S. government effectively framed the UK as the perpetrators, leaving the state vulnerable to an act of Russian retribution. So how will Trowbridge deal with this should he find out what the Americans did? The most dramatic possibility is that Trowbridge might turn to Russia directly. He already detests the current alliance with the US. Why not expose their thievery? By opening a diplomatic line to the other Great Power nation, Trowbridge may see this as an opportunity to assert control and, more importantly, prove that Britain isn't simply America's junior partner. Such a move would shatter decades of Western cooperation and redefine global alliances overnight. But frankly, anything could happen within Trowbridge's brand of reckless self-interest.

3 What's Left of Kate and Hal's Marriage?

Few couples on television are as intoxicating—or as destructive—as Kate and Hal Wyler's. Their marriage has always existed in the grey space between intimacy and ambition, love and manipulation. In fact, Season 3 beautifully depicted this journey, culminating in the finale with them vulnerably re-committing to their union after a period of a ""private"" divorce. But just before viewers could rejoice in their love, everything seemed to crumble as Kate realizes Hal deceived her about the submarine operation.

This betrayal threw a real curveball as this season saw a more self-reflexive Kate who grew to recognize she wasn't as high and mighty as she thought. She and Hal share the same fire that keeps them gravitating towards each other, even though it can be begrudging and incredibly toxic at times. But have we just witnessed Kate's final straw? Is this the act of immorality she simply cannot justify? Hal is one that willingly leans into the complexities of realpolitik, whereas Kate shies away from actions that could lead to a corruption of power. Season 4 will almost certainly test whether their bond can survive moral erosion. And selfishly, I hope it does as they are each other's true match.

4 What's To Become of Kate's Relationship With Her Former Lovers?

Kate's tangled romantic past has always complicated her professional life, but Season 3 turned that tension up several notches. Not only did she finally test the waters with Austin Dennison (David Gyasi), the principled yet calculating British Foreign Secretary, but she also had a full-blown passionate affair with Callum Ellis (Aiden Turner), the British spy whose loyalties are as fluid as hers. But with Kate re-committing to her marriage, while also finding out about the U.S.' major diplomatic betrayal, it's not hard to assume that the dynamics with these British men will inevitably shift, should the truth be revealed.

After all, as the Ambassador to the UK, Kate would be guilty by association. So, will Dennison and Kate's cordial relationship implode? Will Callum act impulsively and disclose their affair, further corroding the American's moral reputation? These men may have given into their affections, but they have proven they'll fight harder for their country. It's likely Season 4 will strip Kate of her most valuable assets—not her title or position, but her ability to earn trust in a place that now sees her as compromised.

5 Will Stuart Walk Away From the Job That's Breaking Him?

Other than Kate, Stuart Hayford (Ato Essandoh) has long served as the show's emotional anchor—the weary, brilliant deputy chief of mission who somehow holds all the chaos together. But by the end of Season 3, even he seemed to have reached his breaking point. Overworked, disillusioned, and weighed down by betrayal, Stuart's once sense of duty now feels like a burden he can no longer bear. His quiet devastation over discovering that the administration he believed in was lying all along has left him adrift.

But Stuart's exhaustion is more than professional—it's existential. His talk with Billie (Nana Mensah) and Eidra (Ali Ahn) hinted at a man who might finally choose self-preservation over service. Yet leaving the embassy would mean abandoning Kate in her most desperate hour, and losing the one stabilizing force the U.S. mission has left in Britain. It's heartbreaking to think that Season 4 may showcase Stuart confronting a cruel paradox in that to save himself, he might have to walk away from the only thing that once gave him purpose.

6 What Will Happen To Eidra and Stuart's Relationship?

Among all the political turmoil, Eidra Park and Stuart's relationship has provided one of the few genuine throughlines in The Diplomat. Their romance began as a quiet reprieve from the chaos—a grounded, realistic take on the secret corporate romance trope. And while it did sadly end early on, their friendship was finally finding solid ground. That is, until the end of Season 3, where, once again, secrets seem to stand in the way of them developing a true relationship.

I guess that's one of the downsides of their line of work: how can trust be built in a budding romance when you're caught in a world of deception? With Stuart's disillusionment growing and Eidra's loyalty to the CIA deepening, their connection could either reignite in defiance of the chaos or fracture beyond repair. Sadly, if the show continues its pattern of moral realism, this love story may not end in triumph, but in quiet tragedy—a reflection of how even the purest bonds can't always survive the machinery of statecraft.

7 Is the Penn–Wyler Administration Entering Its Darkest Chapter Yet?

Despite their initial hostility, Grace Penn and Hal Wyler have always been master tacticians, willing to bend the rules for what they perceive as ""the greater good""—or at least what secures American interest. But by Season 3's end, their partnership seems to have crossed into outright corruption. Orchestrating an international heist under the guise of national security marks a turning point, not just for the characters, but for the show's entire moral framework.",Collider,2025-10-24T23:32:10Z,https://collider.com/the-diplomat-season-3-finale-burning-questions/,0.4,2025-10-25 13:59:56.118847,,-0.1294117647058823

According to a CNBC report citing a recent Goldman Sachs note, the firm’s analysts said their Risk Appetite Indicator has fallen to 0.2, down from the “Goldilocks” zone they were in earlier in the year.

Earlier on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a new record high of 47,326.73, the S&P 500 index rose to 6,806.42, while the Nasdaq Composite touched 23,248.

Sell-off Odds Higher

Goldman Sachs analysts are optimistic that the U.S. economic growth will reaccelerate in 2026. However, they stated that the odds of a sell-off in the equity markets are higher than those of a large rally, according to the report.

“The pick-up in drawdown risk has been driven by elevated equity valuations and a weak U.S. business cycle. Our equity asymmetry framework suggests that the probability of a sell-off is higher than that of a large rally,” the analysts said in the note, according to the report.

QQQ,This 1 Chart Indicator Tells Us It Could Be 1999 All Over Again... and the Dot-Com Crash Comes Next,,"The Sopranos first aired on television. The Blair Witch Project was in theaters. Y2K scared us, but it was just fine. And this new music-sharing service started. It was called Napster. This was 1999. And while we were entertained by all of those pop culture happenings, the main event was the stock market.

The Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) was the center of attention, just as it is today. Some of the businesses leading it back then are still around. Some are among the Magnificent 7 stock giants. Others are simply still in business. And many others are defunct.

Is the Stock Market in 2025 Like the Market in 1999?

OK, enough history. What does that have to do with today? Answer: EVERYTHING!

Because while no two eras of market history are identical, the list of similarities is too long to list here. The big ones include:

Giant tech stocks capture the imagination of investors, to the point where they are their own type of “too big to fail.” While corporate failure is not a realistic consideration for multitrillion-dollar market cap stocks, a steep slide in their stock prices is always possible.

A very concentrated market at the top. Even within QQQ’s 100 stocks, only 10 of them account for 52% of the weighting. The top five of those represent 38% of QQQ. And 20 stocks cover nearly half of the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). It is crowded at the top. Market leadership is nice, but history is littered with this type of stock market behavior that ultimately turned south.

Massive confidence on the part of retail investors. Some of that could be disguised as FOMO, but the fact is, buying the dip is the only way many investors have ever participated in the market.

Margin calls just waiting to happen. The system has held tight thus far. However, warning signs are popping up every week.

The QQQ ETF did not even start until the tech-mania of the 1990s was already in high gear. From its early 1999 inception, it doubled into March 2000. Only to give it all back 12 months later. And, to finally bottom at less than half its starting value, and not until late in 2002.

Given the timing of QQQ’s launch late last century, a weekly chart of its 1999-2000 climb is not a complete picture. But the tail end of it is shown here, in isolation.

Now, take a look at QQQ’s weekly pattern and the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) indicator as it has developed over the past 12 months. Excluding the hiccup caused by the March-April “tariff tantrum,” that chart has a similar vibe to me, versus the turn of the century period above.

I don’t think this is a coincidence. But it is also not a perfect timing indicator. It does, however, make us reconsider just how “all-in” we want to be, knowing that QQQ’s history includes periods like 1999-2000.

So, what can you do if you’re concerned? While that is a personal decision, a few “pro tips” that come to mind include:

Position-sizing. You may love your QQQ, but with all you have made on it, do you need to own this much?

Hedging. Options, inverse ETFs, including those with leverage, and ETFs that hedge using volatility, are just three ways to take the edge off.

This is less about what to buy now, and more about how to play offense and defense at the same time. Or, in pop culture terms, you can party like it’s 1999, as long as you know how to get home safely.

QQQ,Government Shutdown Could Prevent October CPI Release: White House,,"According to a post by U.S. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on X, the October CPI data may not be released.

The White House reporotedly said that the BLS could not collect price surveys during the shutdown, making accurate inflation reporting challenging.

The delay could impact Fed policy decisions and market expectations.

The White House has stated on Friday that the U.S. government shutdown may prevent the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

According to a post on X by U.S. Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said it is “likely” that there will be no October inflation report. She added that the lack of data will “leave businesses, markets, families and the Federal Reserve in disarray.”

A report by Bloomberg added that the White House said the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), responsible for compiling the CPI, has been unable to collect new price information since the shutdown began on October 1.

Challenges Ahead

This disruption raises concerns about the accuracy and timeliness of the upcoming inflation report, scheduled for release in November. Moreover, without the October data, the Federal Reserve may face challenges in assessing current economic conditions, potentially impacting its monetary policy decisions.

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is now a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut interest rates by another 25 basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

September Inflation Report Gives Markets A Boost

The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3% month-on-month, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3%, both lower than expected. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% month over month, with the annual rate at 3%, also below forecasts.

The cooler-than-expected inflation data led to a surge in stocks, with the S&P 500 hitting an intraday high of 6801.20 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average touching 47,156.73. The Nasdaq Composite hit a high of 23,221.76 as of the time of writing.

ETFs tracking the major indices were in the green at market open on Friday. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) was up 0.79%, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) gained 0.87%, and the Nasdaq-100 tracking Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) moved 0.98% higher. SPY and QQQ were among the top trending tickers on Stocktwits at the time of writing. Retail sentiment on the platform around both tickers QQQ improved to ‘bearish’ from ‘extremely bearish’ territory over the past day.

QQQ,CPI Data Fuels JPMorgan's Expectation For Continued Fed 'Insurance' Rate Cuts,,"Seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a 0.3% rise in CPI for September, following a 0.4% increase in August.

JPMorgan senior economist Joseph Seydl said that with the latest CPI inflation, the firm continues to expect the Federal Reserve to provide ""insurance"" rate cuts to support weakening labor demand.

Seydl said that the core services inflation is trending lower, and this moderation is largely driven by easing shelter inflation and other service categories.

According to TheFly, Seydl said that with the latest CPI inflation data coming in softer than expected, the bank continues to expect the Federal Reserve to provide ""insurance"" rate cuts to support weakening labor demand.

In September, core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2%, after a 0.3% increase in August. Seydl said that the core services inflation is trending lower, and this moderation is largely driven by easing shelter inflation and other service categories, which are sensitive to labor market conditions.

QQQ,"How To Trade SPY, Top Tech Stocks As Market Awaits CPI Data",,"Good Morning Traders!

Today is one of the most important trading sessions of the month with the release of the Consumer Price Index for September at 8:30 AM Eastern. This report will heavily influence expectations around monetary policy over the next several meetings and could create sizable volatility if it deviates from forecasts.

At 9:45 AM Eastern, traders will receive updated readings on Manufacturing, Services, and Composite PMIs for October through the S&P Global releases. These datasets help shape the near-term outlook on economic momentum following the Fed's policy stance. Kansas City Services data at 11 AM Eastern will round out the scheduled activity.

With sentiment tightly hinged to inflation expectations, price action is likely to be fast and directional following the morning news. Manage exposure carefully, react to what the tape is showing, and set risk parameters before volatility hits.

Now, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPY opens at 673.75, where buyers are looking to maintain upward momentum ahead of a major data release. A push above this level could carry price into 675.00 and 676.20, with continued strength lifting toward 677.40. If bullish participation grows on positive inflation news, SPY may stretch into 678.65 and 679.85 as investors position into the weekend. Each step higher shows increasing confidence that the market can handle the macro backdrop.

If SPY loses 673.75 off the open, sellers may press into 672.45. A failure to stabilize there can send price into 671.15 and 669.95, with heavier downside potentially reaching 668.70. If momentum accelerates, SPY could dip toward 667.45 before buyers attempt to step back in. These levels will show whether CPI triggers risk-off reactions or simply a brief reset before upside continuation.

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)

QQQ begins the session at 613.75, where bulls will try to carry tech leadership into the new data cycle. A move above could lift price into 614.90 and 616.05, with buyers possibly driving into 617.20. If momentum strengthens, QQQ could stretch into 618.35 and 619.55. Each upward move suggests traders are rotating back into growth if inflation progresses in the right direction.

If QQQ drops below 613.75, sellers may probe into 612.50. A break of that zone could lead into 611.30 and 610.10, with continued softness reaching 608.85. If pressure intensifies, QQQ may find deeper testing into 607.60. These areas will tell us whether the market wants to lighten exposure or simply shake out weak hands on the morning reaction.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Apple opens at 260.50, and bulls want to keep the stock perched near its recent higher base. A hold above could drive price into 261.45 and 262.40, with added momentum lifting toward 263.35. If strength builds post-CPI, Apple may push into 264.30 and 265.25. Each leg higher reinforces the idea that investors continue to view Apple as a defensive cornerstone with upside potential.

If Apple slips below 260.50, sellers may lean into 259.55. Continued pressure could drag the stock into 258.60 and 257.65, with heavier selling reaching 256.70. If weakness expands, Apple may drift toward 255.75 before stabilizing. These zones will reveal whether a soft CPI print shakes investor confidence or simply offers fresh entries.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)

Microsoft begins the day at 521.75, where buyers will be watching for confirmation after a steady week of grind higher. A move above could send price into 522.95 and 524.20, with continued strength driving into 525.40. If demand accelerates, MSFT may stretch toward 526.65 and 527.85. Each push upward shows traders staying committed to quality mega caps through volatility.

If MSFT breaks below 521.75, sellers may target 520.55. A drop under here opens the path to 519.35 and 518.10, with heavier downside reaching 516.90. If selling firms up, the stock could test 515.70 before buyers appear. These levels will help determine how sensitive software names are to inflation expectations today.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

NVIDIA opens at 183.25, where bulls will try to show continued accumulation after recent hesitation. A move higher could lift price into 184.30 and 185.35, with momentum carrying into 186.40. If upside extends, NVDA may reach 187.45 and 188.50. Each advancement reinforces ongoing confidence in semiconductors as a leading segment.

If NVIDIA loses 183.25, sellers may pull price into 182.20. A deeper fade could expose 181.15 and 180.10, with added weakness carrying into 179.05. If pressure continues, the stock could slip toward 178.00 before catching support. These zones show where growth appetite could temporarily fade if CPI disappoints.

Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)

Alphabet starts the session at 256.25, and buyers will try to sustain its recent positive tone. A move above could push price into 257.20 and 258.15, with buyers later chasing into 259.10. If strength builds, the stock could reach 260.00 and 260.95. Each rise would highlight continued trust in communication names even during data-driven volatility.

If GOOGL fails at 256.25, sellers may drag it into 255.25. A breakdown there exposes 254.20 and 253.15, with deeper selling bringing the tape into 252.10. If momentum softens further, the stock could test 251.05 before setting a base. These levels reveal where bargain hunters could emerge if the morning numbers create a short-term dip.

Meta Platforms Inc (META)

Meta opens at 737.50, with bulls looking to extend its sturdy climb. A lift above could bring price into 739.70 and 741.85, with more aggressive continuation pushing into 744.00. If buyers remain eager, META may reach 746.20 and 748.35. Each new high signals that traders remain committed to strength in the higher beta growth names.

If META falls below 737.50, sellers may push into 735.35. Continued weakness could target 733.20 and 731.10, with heavier downside driving toward 728.95. If selling continues, the stock may slip toward 726.85 before stabilizing. These zones will show whether volatility after CPI is a brief shakeout or a warning signal.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

Tesla begins the morning at 446.25, and buyers will attempt to build a firmer base for continuation. A move higher could carry price into 447.85 and 449.45, with stronger participation driving into 451.00. If bullish enthusiasm increases, Tesla may stretch into 452.60 and 454.20. Each move upward shows improving conviction after weeks of consolidation.

If Tesla drops below 446.25, sellers may first probe 444.65. A loss of this level could take the stock into 443.05 and 441.50, with added weakness driving into 439.95. If pressure builds, Tesla could retest 438.40 before buyers return. These areas will be key in assessing whether risk appetite holds up on the inflation print.

QQQ,Should Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) Be on Your Investing Radar?,,"Launched on 09/22/2010, the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $19.96 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Growth

Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.

Costs

Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.67%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 47.40% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Telecom round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 12.33% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).

The top 10 holdings account for about 60.28% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

VONG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of large-capitalization growth stocks in the United States.

The ETF has added roughly 13.39% so far this year and was up about 24.64% in the last one year (as of 08/09/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $66.09 and $98.39.

The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 21.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 410 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VONG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.

The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $127.03 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $269.82 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.

Bottom-Line

Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Cues From Last Session

Based on the sector performance data from Wednesday, the market saw broad gains, with the all sectors weighted average up 0.58%.

Insights From Analysts

While the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has captured headlines and fueled much of the S&P 500 Index’s rally this year, the resulting infrastructure demands are creating major opportunities in “periphery plays,” according to a Wells Fargo Investment Institute commentary.

Scott Wren, Senior Global Market Strategist, wrote that long before AI, “the U.S. power grid was in dire need of upgrading in many, if not most, areas of the country”.

The emergence of power-intensive AI data centers has been a “game changer,” forcing the massive grid upgrades that were already necessary. Wren argues that investors should look beyond just the Technology sector.

“That means we believe our favored sectors beyond just Technology, such as Industrials and Utilities, are also set to benefit,” Wren noted. These sectors are essential for building the data centers, manufacturing components, upgrading the grid, and providing electricity.

Citing estimates that $3 will be spent on supporting infrastructure for every $1 spent on AI, Wren believes this is just the beginning. “We are now only in the early innings of what in our view is a longer-term secular trend”.

QQQ,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 Futures Climb As Market Eyes Yet Another Weekly Gain --  Strategist Suggests Rally May Have More Legs",,"The major averages are on track to record gains for a second straight week as earnings optimism and geopolitical concerns abate.

With the government shutdown continuing, the release of the September consumer price inflation report, due Friday, has been temporarily suspended.

The upcoming week could pose a key test for markets, given that several high-profile, heavily weighted tech names are due to announce quarterly results.

U.S. stocks are primed to close the week on an upbeat note, with the major index futures firmly in the green. All three major averages — the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are on track to record gains for a second straight week as earnings optimism and geopolitical concerns abate.

Intel's (INTC) robust results, reported after the market closed on Thursday, should buoy sentiment toward the tech stocks in Friday's session. The upcoming week could pose a key test for markets, given several high-profile, heavily weighted tech names, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) are all due to announce their quarterly results.

How Futures Are Trading

As of 2 a.m. ET on Friday, the Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 futures rose about 0.35% and the S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.23% and 0.14%.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment toward the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, remained ‘bearish’ heading into Friday’s session. Retail also held a ‘bearish’ view on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, although sentiment saw a modicum of improvement from the ‘extremely bearish’ mood seen a day ago. The message volume on both streams dropped to ‘normal’ levels.

How Markets Traded On Thursday

Stocks advanced notably on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that high-level delegations from both China and the U.S. would thrash out differences over tariffs at a meeting to be held during the weekend in Malaysia. Trump also confirmed that he would meet with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during his diplomatic trip to South Korea next week. Energy, industrial, IT, and materials stocks led from the front, while defensive sectors such as consumer staples, real estate, and utilities saw slight weakness.

The QQQ and SPY ETFs gained 0.44% and 0.59%, respectively. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rallied 1.27% and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) rose a more modest 0.32%.

The outlook could be rosier, going by historical data shared by Carson Group Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. He noted that “November is the best month for stocks since 1950, second best month the past 20 years, best month the past decade, and third best in a post-election year.”

Key Catalysts To Watch Out For

With the government shutdown continuing, the release of the September consumer price inflation report, due Friday, has been temporarily suspended. S&P is scheduled to release its flash manufacturing and services purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) for October at 9:45 a.m. ET. The manufacturing PMI is expected to edge down to 51.8 from 52 in September, and the services PMI is estimated to have slipped to 54 from 54.2.

The University of Michigan’s flash consumer sentiment index for October is expected to edge down to 54.9 from September’s 55.

Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), General Dynamics (GD), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and Procter & Gamble (PF) are among the companies reporting their quarterly results before the market opens on Friday.

How Other Markets Fared

Crude oil futures slipped amid profit-taking early Friday, following the week’s substantial advance. On Thursday, oil settled up 5.6% on Trump’s sanctions against Russian oil companies. Gold futures also pulled back. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note is marginally higher early Friday following Thursday’s rise. The U.S. dollar was slightly firmer against other major currencies.

QQQ,"Trump Ends US-Canada Trade Talks Over 'Fake Reagan' Tariff Ad, Accuses Ottawa Of Meddling With Supreme Court Decision",,"Trump claimed the Ronald Reagan Foundation confirmed Canada used a fabricated version of Reagan’s 1987 anti-tariff remarks in a $75,000 ad campaign aimed at influencing U.S. court decisions.

The Ontario-led campaign, worth $75 million, uses Reagan’s speech warning that tariffs lead to retaliation and trade wars, and is airing across major U.S. networks.

The announcement followed rising trade tensions, with Canada recently cutting tariff-free import quotas for U.S. automakers and reaffirming plans to defend domestic auto jobs.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada have been terminated, accusing Ottawa of using a “fake” Ronald Reagan advertisement criticizing tariffs to influence U.S. court decisions.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed the Ronald Reagan Foundation had confirmed that Canada “fraudulently used” a fabricated video of Reagan speaking against tariffs in an ad that cost $75,000. He said the move was meant “to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts,” calling it “egregious behavior.”

“TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump wrote.

What The Reagan Foundation Said

​​The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, in a post on X, said the ad misrepresents a presidential radio address Reagan delivered in April 1987 and that his remarks were edited without its permission. The entity added that it was ""reviewing its legal options in this matter.""

Ontario’s $75 Million Reagan Ad Campaign

The controversy stems from a $75 million ad campaign launched by Ontario Premier Doug Ford that uses clips from Reagan’s 1987 televised speech, in which the former president warned that high tariffs “inevitably lead to retaliation” and “fierce trade wars.”

Ford said during the launch, “I’m a big Ronald Reagan fan. We’re going to launch a $75 million ad and repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country.”

The video carries a disclaimer that the ad is not approved by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library or the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.

Supreme Court Decision On Tariffs Pending

Last month, the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s request to hear its appeal of lower court rulings that had struck down many of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs. The Court also approved the administration’s request to expedite the appeal on an accelerated timeline.

Throwback To Chinese Playbook

The controversy echoes a July post from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, which shared the same 1987 Reagan speech on X, saying it “finds new relevance in 2025.” The clip highlighted Reagan’s warning that tariffs can lead to retaliation, trade wars, and “economic collapse.” The embassy’s move was widely interpreted as a jab at Trump’s escalating tariff policies, which have already sparked retaliatory actions from trading partners including China and Canada.

Canada Cuts Tariff-Free Quotas for Automakers

Hours before Trump’s post, Canada reduced tariff-free import quotas for General Motors and Stellantis, escalating trade tensions. Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said GM’s quota will be cut by 24.2% and Stellantis’ by 50% after both automakers scaled back factory operations in Ontario.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment was ‘bearish’ amid ‘normal’ message volume for both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), while it was ‘neutral’ amid ‘low’ message volume for the iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC).

QQQ,Mark Carney Reportedly Says Canada Ready To Resume Trade Talks With US 'When The Americans Are Ready',,"Trade talks between the U.S. and Canada were ongoing regarding steel, aluminum, and energy.

However, President Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday that all these talks with Canada have been terminated.

A televised advertisement funded by the province of Ontario is the reason behind President Trump halting trade talks with Canada.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reportedly stated on Friday that his government is ready to resume trade talks with the United States, noting that the two sides had been making headway before U.S. President Donald Trump halted negotiations.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

According to a Bloomberg report, Carney stated that the U.S. trade policy had “fundamentally changed” from the 1980s through the 2000s. He made the statement ahead of his nine-day trip to Asia, where he will attend the summits of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

President Trump is also set to attend the ASEAN and APEC summits.

Progress Halted

Trade talks between the U.S. and Canada were ongoing regarding steel, aluminum, and energy. However, President Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday that all these talks with Canada have been terminated over the country’s “egregious behavior.”

While Carney did not comment on this, he said Canada would resume the talks when his American counterparts are ready, according to the report.

Meanwhile, U.S. equities gained in Friday’s opening trade. At the time of writing, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index, was up 0.89%, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) gained 1.08%, while the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) rose 1.01%. Retail sentiment around the S&P 500 ETF on Stocktwits was in the ‘bearish’ territory.

Ontario’s Reagan Advertisement Ruffles Feathers

A televised advertisement campaign funded by the province of Ontario against President Trump’s tariffs is at the center of the new blowup between President Trump and Canada.

The ad uses excerpts from former President Ronald Reagan’s 1987 address, which called tariffs an outdated idea that drives up prices and hurts U.S. workers. In a post on Truth Social, President Trump called the ad “fake” and said it was intended to interfere with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on tariffs.

In a subsequent post early on Friday, President Trump said Canada “cheated and got caught.”

“They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country,” President Trump stated.",Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,2025-10-24T15:38:15Z,https://newsable.asianetnews.com/markets/mark-carney-reportedly-says-canada-ready-to-resume-trade-talks-with-us-when-the-americans-are-ready-articleshow-1izpoug,0.9,2025-10-25 14:00:34.076131,,0.3254901960784313

While the markets reacted favorably to Friday’s CPI report, the Sep CPI report of +3.0% y/y rose to match the current 16-month high, and the core CPI report of +3.0% y/y was still far above the Fed’s inflation target of +2.0%.

Stocks also saw support from Friday’s Oct S&P US manufacturing PMI report of +0.2 to 52.2, stronger than expectations of unchanged at 52.0. Also, the Oct S&P US services PMI report of +1.0 to 55.2 was stronger than expectations for a -0.7 point decline to 53.5.

Mr. Trump claimed the ad was deceptive and said it was designed to influence the US Supreme Court ahead of oral arguments on November 5 on the legality of Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Lower courts have already deemed Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs illegal, ruling the tariffs are based on a specious claim of emergency authority. If the US Supreme Court upholds those rulings, the US government will have to refund the tariffs already collected, and Mr. Trump’s power to impose tariffs will be limited to well-founded sections of US trade law.

Later in the day, Ontario said it plans to pause the anti-tariff ad campaign. Also, Canadian Prime Minister Carney said Canada is prepared to resume trade talks “when the Americans are ready.”

The markets are focused on US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The US government shutdown continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown is delaying the release of government reports, including the last four weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets are focused on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Positive corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) fell -1 tick, while the 10-year T-note yield fell -0.4 bp to 3.997%. T-notes rebounded from early losses on the slightly weaker-than-expected US CPI report. Also, the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate fell by -0.6 bp to 2.298%.

T-notes have support from the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

The markets are discounting a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

The markets are focused on US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

The US government shutdown continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown is delaying the release of government reports, including the last four weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

This week, markets are focused on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Positive corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

Overseas stock markets on Friday are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.26%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.71%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.35%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) are up +2 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -1.2 bp at 3.989%. T-notes rebounded from early losses on the slightly weaker-than-expected US CPI report. Also, the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate today is down -2.4 bp at 2.279%.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

European government bond yields are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield is up +3.5 bp at 2.618%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -0.4 bp at 4.420%.

Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

The Magnificent Seven stocks today are all trading higher, except for a -1.5% decline in Tesla (TSLA). Notable gainers include a +2.4% gain in Alphabet (GOOG), and gains of more than 1% in Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN).

Crypto stocks are seeing support today with Bitcoin up +1.2% and Ethereum up +3.2%.

Stock indexes are trading higher after today’s slightly weaker-than-expected US CPI report arguably gave the Fed more latitude to cut interest rates. The Sep CPI report of +0.3% m/m and +3.0% y/y was slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.4% m/m and +3.1% y/y. Also, the Sep core CPI report of +0.3% m/m and +3.1% y/y was slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.2% m/m and +3.1% y/y.

While the markets reacted favorably to today’s CPI report, the Sep CPI report of +3.0% y/y rose to match the current 16-month high, and the core CPI report of +3.0% y/y was still far above the Fed’s inflation target of +2.0%.

Stocks also saw support from today’s Oct S&P US manufacturing PMI report of +0.2 to 52.2, which was stronger than expectations of unchanged at 52.0. Also, the Oct S&P US services PMI report of +1.0 to 55.2, was stronger than expectations for a -0.7 point decline to 53.5.

On the negative side, today’s final-Oct University of Michigan US consumer sentiment index fell -1.4 points to 53.6, which was weaker than market expectations of a -0.5 point drop to 54.5.

Stocks were undercut when President Trump late Thursday announced he had terminated trade negotiations with Canada, citing an anti-tariff advertisement released by the provincial government of Ontario that apparently hit a nerve with Mr. Trump. The ad featured former US President Reagan speaking out in a 1987 address in favor of free trade and against tariffs, calling tariffs an outdated idea that stifles innovation, drives up prices, and hurts US workers.

Mr. Trump claimed the ad was deceptive and said it was designed to influence the US Supreme Court ahead of oral arguments on November 5 on the legality of Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Lower courts have already deemed Mr. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs illegal because those courts said the tariffs are based on a specious claim of emergency authority.

QQQ,US Stocks Hit New Highs As Hopes For Rate Cuts Grow,,"What’s going on here?

US stocks soared to new record highs this week after cooling inflation numbers reignited hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates twice before year-end.

What does this mean?

Major US indexes surged on growing confidence that lower inflation will push the Fed toward two rate cuts in 2025. Broad funds like the iShares Russell 2000 ETF and iShares S&P 500 ETF notched notable gains, while the Nasdaq-focused Invesco QQQ Trust jumped 1.2%. Financial sector ETFs outperformed, with bullish funds like the Financial Select Sector SPDR rallying even as energy ETFs slipped despite a modest uptick in oil prices. Semiconductors fueled tech gains, and industrials and healthcare stocks also moved higher. Gold edged up, while silver swung between gains and losses, and the consumer sector was mixed with retailers outperforming. In crypto, bitcoin climbed 0.8% and ether-based ETFs outperformed, though some broader crypto funds lagged.

Why should I care?

For markets: Renewed optimism is lifting stocks.

Talk of Fed rate cuts has given investors a boost, driving both tech and financial shares to fresh highs. Semiconductor and growth stocks led the way as lower borrowing costs came back into focus, while industrials joined the uptrend. Even though energy shares lagged, broad-based gains point to growing confidence across the market. If inflation stays under control, equity momentum could stick around.

The bigger picture: Lower rates could supercharge economic activity.

Hopes for easing monetary policy aren’t just cheering investors—they could help reinvigorate business investment and consumer spending nationwide. Lower rates make it easier for companies to fund growth and for households to borrow. That puts a spotlight on the Fed, as markets and global economies watch its every move for signs of longer-term recovery.",Finimize,2025-10-24T17:23:21Z,https://finimize.com/content/us-stocks-hit-new-highs-as-hopes-for-rate-cuts-grow,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-25 14:00:30.289067,,0.3019607843137255
QQQ,Trump: 'Stock Market Is Stronger Than Ever Because of Tariffs!' - SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY),,"President Donald Trump linked his tariffs to the record-breaking U.S. stock market on Friday and the latest data seems to support his opinion.

The SPY is climbing. See all of the details here.

""Because of Tariffs!""

Trump promoted his protective trade policies as bolstering the U.S. economy in a series of social media posts Friday morning.

""THE UNITED STATES IS WEALTHY, POWERFUL, AND NATIONALLY SECURE AGAIN, ALL BECAUSE OF TARIFFS!"" Trump said on Truth Social.

""THE STOCK MARKET IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS!"" he added in a follow-up post.

Critics of Trump's trade policies have warned that tariffs could raise costs for consumers and industries that depend on imported materials. However, the latest inflation data suggests that the tariffs are not causing a rise in inflation.

The CPI report released on Friday morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics came in cooler-than-expected and showed that the rate of inflation is actually easing.

Markets rallied following the encouraging inflation data, supporting Trump's assertion that the stock market is ""stronger than ever.""

In fact, all three major indices rose to new all-time highs on Friday morning. The S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY), was up 0.83% and the Nasdaq 100, tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) gained 1.19%, according to Benzinga Pro.

Trade Tensions

President Trump abruptly terminated trade talks with Canada on Thursday, blaming what he described as a ""fraudulent"" Ontario advertisement that featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs as harmful to workers and consumers.

The move injects new uncertainty into one of America's most important trading relationships, as Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country remains ready to resume negotiations when the U.S. is ready.""

Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea, marking their first face-to-face meeting since Trump's return to office.

The discussions are expected to focus on trade tensions and export restrictions, with Trump signaling that major new tariffs on Chinese imports could follow if talks stall.

Both leaders have expressed cautious optimism, and global markets will watch closely for signs of de-escalation.

QQQ,Forget Wall Street Jargon: This 3-Step Plan Could Turn First-Time Investors Into Lifelong Winners | The Motley Fool,,"There's a memorable scene in the film The Big Short where Ryan Gosling's character smirks and says most people are intimidated by finance because they don't understand the language. He's right. Wall Street has a talent for making simple ideas sound overly complex -- turning investing into something that feels out of reach for everyday people.

But the truth is, successful investing doesn't require fancy terms or insider access. Terms like ""EBITDA"" or ""basis points"" or ""alpha"" might sound intimidating, but they describe concepts that anyone can grasp with a little patience.

When I worked as an investment banking analyst specializing in mergers and acquisitions, I lived and breathed this jargon. We tossed around phrases like ""pro forma financials"" and ""synergy projections"" daily. It was part of the job -- but it also created the illusion that investing was reserved for experts.

But you don't need to understand every spreadsheet or acronym to succeed as an investor. What matters most is consistency, discipline, and a clear plan for your money.

If you've ever searched for how to start investing and felt overwhelmed, you're not alone. The good news is that building wealth doesn't have to be complicated. Follow this simple three-step plan, and you can set yourself up for a lifetime of financial growth -- no Wall Street dictionary required.

1. Build a strong savings foundation

Before you start investing, you need one essential thing: a solid savings cushion. Think of it as your financial foundation -- the base that keeps you secure when unexpected expenses arise. Start by setting aside a fixed portion of your paycheck each month, ideally 10% to 20%, and automate the transfers, so the money moves directly into your savings account before you have a chance to spend it.

Creating a detailed monthly budget can help, too. Track every expense for 30 days to see where your money actually goes. Many people are surprised to find how much they spend on dining out, unused subscriptions, or impulse purchases. Redirecting even a portion of that cash toward savings can make a real difference over time.

Your first milestone should be an emergency fund worth from three to six months of living expenses. Keep it safe but accessible -- ideally in a high-yield savings account. These accounts typically pay far more interest than traditional ones, allowing your cash to grow passively while you prepare to invest.

2. Open a brokerage account and start investing

Once your savings foundation is in place, it's time to make your money work for you. The next step is to open a brokerage account with a reputable provider such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or Robinhood Markets.

Within your brokerage, start with low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, an S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) ETF gives you instant exposure to America's top companies -- essentially letting you own a slice of the entire stock market. Over time, this has proven to be one of the most reliable ways to build wealth.

As you gain confidence, consider diversifying with a few specialized ETFs. A technology ETF such as Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ +1.07%) can help capture innovation, a dividend ETF can generate passive income, and a bond ETF can add stability. For those comfortable with higher risk, allocating a small portion to cryptocurrency can provide exposure to emerging digital assets.

The goal isn't to chase fads -- it's to build a well-balanced, diversified portfolio that compounds steadily over decades.

3. Invest consistently, and think long-term

Markets move in cycles, and even the strongest portfolios will experience ups and downs. What separates successful investors from everyone else is consistency. Invest regularly, no matter what the headlines say. Automation helps -- set up recurring deposits into your brokerage account so you're always buying, whether prices are high or low.

When markets dip, view it as an opportunity to buy stocks at a discount -- not a reason to panic. Over time, the power of compounding can turn steady contributions into significant wealth. By staying disciplined -- doubling down on your winners and trimming underperformers -- you'll naturally position your portfolio toward long-term strength.

Ultimately, building wealth isn't about timing the market -- it's about time in the market. The longer your money stays invested and compounds, the larger your financial snowball becomes.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-24T12:46:30Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/24/forget-wall-street-jargon-this-3-step-plan-could/,0.7,2025-10-25 14:00:50.189899,,0.2627450980392156

European government bond yields are moving higher today. The 10-year German bund yield is up +1.6 bp to 2.579%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +0.8 bp to 4.425%.

QQQ,"Inflation Landed Where Trump Wanted: These 10 Stocks Are Rallying - Apollo Asset Management (NYSE:APO), Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM)",,"September inflation data came in cooler than expected, reinforcing bets that the Federal Reserve will press ahead with interest-rate cuts — and giving President Donald Trump a narrative win as he touted that his tariffs aren't fueling broad-based price increases.

The headline Consumer Price Index rose 3% year-over-year, according to Friday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics –released after a nine-day delay due to the government shutdown. That was below the expected 3.1% and up slightly from 2.9% in August.

On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.3%, slowing from the 0.4% pace in August.

Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, also softened. It rose 3% year-over-year, down from 3.1% in August and below economists' forecasts for no change.

Monthly core inflation increased 0.2%, a step down from both the previous and expected 0.3%.

Trump Claims Victory on Tariffs

Before the CPI data was released, Trump posted a message on Truth Social touting tariffs as a key driver of economic strength.

""The stock market is stronger than ever before because of tariffs. The United States is wealthy, powerful, and nationally secure again, all because of tariffs. The most important case ever is in the United States Supreme Court. God bless America,"" Trump wrote.

Markets Surge To New Highs On CPI

Wall Street jumped to fresh record highs Friday morning as investors embraced the cooler inflation report and welcomed news that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet next week.

Fed futures show a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Oct. 30 FOMC meeting is now fully priced in. Markets also assign a 94% probability of another cut in December, with a small 3% chance of a larger, 50-point move.

The S&P 500 index – as tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) – opened 0.8% higher at 6,790 points, reaching a new all-time high.

The Nasdaq 100 – tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) – rose 1% to 25,350, also hitting a record.

QQQ,Stocks Retreat on Chipmaker Weakness and Renewed China Tensions,,"The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.84%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.4 bp to 3.949%. T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled slightly higher. Wednesday’s slump in stocks, sparked by renewed China trade tensions, triggered short covering in T-notes and pushed prices higher. T-notes maintained modest gain on Wednesday due to strong demand for the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields were mixed on Wednesday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +1.1 bp to 2.563%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and finished down -6.0 bp to 4.417%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, “The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive,” and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

QQQ,Is Blackstone a Buy After Investment Firm Ascent Wealth Partners Initiated a Position in the Stock? todayheadline,,"What happened

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated October 21, 2025, Ascent Wealth Partners, LLC reported a new position in Blackstone (BX 4.17%). The fund disclosed ownership of 51,697 shares, with a quarter-end market value of $8.83 million.

The stake amounts to 1.02% of Ascent’s $862.10 million in reportable U.S. equity assets across 181 positions as of September 30, 2025.

What else to know

This is a newly established position, representing 1.02% of 13F reportable assets under management.

Ascent Wealth Partners’ top holdings as of September 30, 2025 were:

IWF: $75.13 million (8.7% of AUM)

QQQ: $57.00 million (6.6% of AUM)

AAPL: $38.90 million (4.5% of AUM)

MDY: $37.93 million (4.4% of AUM)

MSFT: $24.69 million (2.9% of AUM)

As of October 20, 2025, Blackstone shares were priced at $160.44, down 6.05% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 17.65 percentage points during that time period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

Blackstone Inc. is a leading global alternative asset manager with a diversified portfolio spanning real estate, private equity, credit, and hedge fund solutions.

The company provides alternative asset management services, including real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions, credit, and multi-asset strategies.

It manages and invests capital across diverse asset classes for institutional and individual investors globally. Headquartered in New York, Blackstone has a global presence serving clients in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Foolish take

Ascent Wealth Partners’ purchase of Blackstone stock is noteworthy for a few reasons. The move represented Ascent initiating a position in the company, and it was a big buy. Blackstone now represents 1% of Ascent’s AUM, putting it among the firm’s top 30 holdings out of nearly 200.

This suggests Ascent sees upside in Blackstone stock, which is a bold sentiment considering shares are down in 2025. The stock fell once again after the company released its third quarter earnings report.

Blackstone’s Q3 revenue dropped to $3.1 billion from the prior year’s $3.7 billion, and missed Wall Street analyst expectations. The sales slump contributed to a decline in Q3 diluted earnings per share to $0.80 from $1.02 in 2024.

Despite this, Blackstone is demonstrating strong performance in other key areas. It achieved a record AUM of $1.2 trillion in Q3, a 12% increase year over year. Its fee-related earnings, a crucial indicator of recurring revenue, reached $1.5 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth.

These metrics show Blackstone’s business is solid, and the company has delivered rising return on equity to shareholders over the past couple of years. These factors, and Blackstone’s lower share price, may have been why Ascent decided to begin a position in the stock. With the dip in Blackstone’s stock after Q3 earnings, now looks like a good time to buy.

QQQ,This Fund Bet $3.3 Billion on GPIX  --  Here's Why Income-Focused ETFs Are Gaining Momentum todayheadline | Today Headline,,"Ellis Investment Partners disclosed a purchase of Goldman Sachs S&P 500 Premium Income ETF (GPIX +0.54%) shares valued at an estimated $3.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, according to an SEC filing released Wednesday.

What Happened

According to an SEC filing on Wednesday, Ellis Investment Partners increased its stake in the Goldman Sachs S&P 500 Premium Income ETF by 64,462 shares during the third quarter. The estimated transaction value was $3.3 million. Following this buy, the fund’s position totals 107,147 shares valued at $5.6 million as of September 30.

What Else to Know

This was a buy; the GPIX stake now represents 1.01% of Ellis Investment Partners’ 13F reportable AUM.

Top holdings after the filing:

NYSEMKT:VUG: $30.5 million (5.5% of AUM)

As of Thursday’s market close, GPIX shares were priced at $52.41, up 7% over the past year versus a 16% gain for the S&P 500.

ETF Overview

ETF Snapshot

GPIX invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of companies included in the S&P 500 Index, aiming to match the style, capitalization, and industry characteristics of the benchmark.

Underlying holdings are diversified across S&P 500 constituents, with a portfolio composition designed to maintain close alignment with the index.

The ETF provides investors with systematic exposure to large-cap U.S. equities and enhanced income potential.

The fund offers investors a rules-based approach to income generation from S&P 500 equities, maintaining broad market exposure while focusing on yield and diversification.

Foolish Take

Ellis Investment Partners’ latest investment in the Goldman Sachs S&P 500 Premium Income ETF (GPIX) highlights the continued appeal of income-focused equity strategies among institutional investors seeking steady returns. The ETF, which launched last year, blends traditional S&P 500 exposure with an options overlay that generates monthly income distributions, yielding a roughly 8% 12-month distribution rate as of September 30. That structure has drawn demand from investors looking for yield without leaving equities. GPIX’s assets under management stand $1.95 billion as of late October, underscoring its momentum in the premium-income ETF space.

For Ellis, and given the ETF’s top holdings in NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple, this move complements its growth-heavy investments in VUG, QQQ, and AAPL, adding a more defensive element to the portfolio after a strong year for risk assets. For long-term investors, GPIX offers an alternative to bond-like income with equity participation, even though the options strategy can lag in sharply rising markets.

SOXX,The AI Gold Rush: Do Semiconductor ETFs Hold the Key Opportunities?,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is proving to be a powerful and enduring force, driving a massive rally in semiconductor stocks and subsequently the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track them. Despite concerns of a potential bubble burst, continued expansion in AI is keeping the prospects for semiconductor ETFs bright.

The Unstoppable AI Business Boom

The AI sector has been experiencing unprecedented growth lately, fueled by historic levels of investment. As per Gartner’s September 2025 report, global spending on AI is expected to reach nearly $1.5 trillion by the end of this year.

It is needless to mention that gigantic investments from major tech hyperscalers’ growing venture in data centers have been playing the role of a major growth catalyst for the AI business' boom. Evidently, Big Tech firms Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) reported in August 2025 that they were set to spend as much as a cumulative $364 billion in their respective 2025 fiscal years, driven by their investments in AI, up from their prior estimates of around $325 billion (as cited in a Yahoo Finance press release).

With AI being rapidly integrated across diverse industries, ranging from automation of manual tasks in banking to personalizing treatment in the healthcare service industry, its growth prospects remain robust. Gartner projects overall global AI spending to exceed $2 trillion by 2026-end.

Why Semiconductors Are Soaring

Semiconductor companies remain the fundamental building blocks of AI. Advanced chips are essential for processing the enormous, data-intensive workloads required for AI applications. This has led to enormous growth for the semiconductor industry.

Notably, the Morningstar Global Semiconductors Index surged 34% (from the start of the year till Sept. 29, 2025), registering more than double the return of the entire U.S. market.

Interestingly, the AI boom is benefiting not just chip designers like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) but also manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and equipment suppliers like ASML Holding (ASML), which are critical to producing advanced semiconductors.

Looking ahead, Morningstar analysts expect AI chip revenues to increase roughly fourfold over the next few years, growing at a compound annual rate of 40% through 2028. This indicates the solid growth potential for semiconductor stocks.

The Case for Semiconductor ETFs

While the AI boom is here to stay, it goes without saying that uncertainty continues to persist in multiple forms, like the U.S.-China trade tension or an unexpected geopolitical event, potentially impacting one or more of the semiconductor stocks mentioned above. So, ETFs tracking these stocks will offer a strategic way to capitalize on the AI growth trend while managing risk.

As most of the semiconductor ETFs provide concentrated exposure to the entire semiconductor ecosystem, from designers and manufacturers to equipment suppliers, investing in them will instantly diversify your portfolio, mitigating the risk of investing in individual stocks.

Semiconductor ETFs in Focus

To make the most of the current market situation, investors interested in semiconductor ETFs may keep these ETFs in their portfolios:

VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

This fund, with total net assets worth $33.81 billion, offers exposure to companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment. Its top three holdings are NVIDIA (18.03%), Taiwan Semiconductor (9.89%) and Broadcom (8.25%).

SOXX,Chip ETFs: The Best Way to Profit from the AI Boom?,,"Chip stocks bounced back strongly yesterday, recovering their losses from Friday, mainly due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and Broadcom’s major AI deal.

Semiconductor stocks have been the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as these companies provide the “picks and shovels” for the AI gold rush.

Semiconductor ETFs are also among the best-performing ETFs of the past decade, as chips, the fundamental building blocks of computation, have become integral to everything from smartphones to cars, laptops, PCs, video games, and data centers.

Chip Megadeals: Bubble or Boom?

Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI announced a strategic partnership under which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The investment will support new data centers with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The Trump administration has also approved some Nvidia chip exports to the UAE.

AMD (AMD) shares have surged recently after the chip designer announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with OpenAI on data centers that will use AMD chips. Under the deal, OpenAI will purchase six gigawatts’ worth of AMD chips and receive about a 10% equity stake in AMD, granted in phases upon reaching certain milestones.

AMD has long been viewed as a distant second in the AI chip market, which is dominated by Nvidia with more than a 75% market share.

OpenAI and Broadcom (AVGO) also announced a partnership to develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and computing systems over four years. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Intel (INTC), which lost its edge years ago to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), received a boost as Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel.

The investment follows the U.S. government’s 10% stake in Intel, now worth about 50% more due to the company’s stock rally. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have supported Intel to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing.

OpenAI estimates that one gigawatt of capacity costs about $50 billion to bring online, with roughly two-thirds of that spent on chips, hardware, and infrastructure, according to the Financial Times.

SOXX,Why Did The Market Bounce Today?  for NASDAQ:SERV by Trading-Capital,,"Today the market bounced for 2 reasons....
1. Broadcom AVGO received news of another OPENAI partnership. This multi year billion dollar deal caused the stock to bounce double digits. When this name rallies it causes liquidity to flow into the $SOXX. Semiconductors are still the heartbeat of this market and have propped everything up today.
The OPENAI headline seems to be running out of steam as the last 3 partnership announcements caused 3 stock to make new highs but AVGO did not take out its highs. This will be on watch.
2. The bond market was closed today allowing investors to not have to worry about catalysts or yields. There's an old saying on ""when the cats away, the mice will play"" .
The bond market is the much larger investment market aka the ""cat"" and this liquidity has clearly spilled over into smaller cap higher beta stocks.

SOXX,AMD-OpenAI Seal Deal: Your Signal to Ride the Wave With AMD-Heavy ETFs,,"In a landmark move that sent shockwaves across the global tech sector, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and OpenAI signed a strategic partnership, worth multi-billion dollars, on Oct. 6, 2025. This strategic agreement entails OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts (GW) of computing power using AMD’s Instinct GPUs, in addition to including a warrant for OpenAI to acquire a stake of up to 10% in AMD.

As one can imagine, this announcement sparked a significant surge in AMD’s share price, which soared almost 24% in the last trading session and, in a ripple effect, also caused a notable appreciation in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) universe, particularly those with a heavy weightage in AMD.

The Theology of AI Boom & ETF Investment

The artificial intelligence (AI) sector’s meteoric rise can be attributed to its game-changing potential across nearly every industry in the modern world, spanning from healthcare diagnostics and autonomous vehicles to financial services and robotics. The soaring demand for generative AI, driven by applications such as large language models, digital assistants, and rapid data analysis, has placed an unprecedented strain on global computing infrastructure.

This pressure, coupled with advances in GPU technology, has been fueling the race among AI companies to secure the hardware necessary for their development. Consequently, we are witnessing a series of historic collaborations, with chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) signing multi-billion-dollar deals with leaders like OpenAI to supply the GPUs that form the backbone of AI infrastructure.

For tech investors, this environment presents a golden opportunity to gain exposure to the AI revolution through AI-heavy ETFs rather than investing in individual stocks. This approach will mitigate the specific risks associated with single companies, even sector leaders like AMD or Nvidia, carrying high idiosyncratic risk tied to single product cycles, execution hurdles, and fierce competition. Thus, by focusing on AI and in particular AMD-heavy ETFs, investors can capture the upside of the AI revolution without putting all their eggs in one basket, diversifying the unique risks that come with betting on any single player.

3 AMD-Heavy ETFs to Watch

Below, we have mentioned AI-focused Technology ETFs that have heavy weightage in chipmakers, especially AMD, in line with the discussion mentioned above. We will see that these ETFs not only witnessed price appreciation in yesterday’s trading session but have also delivered solid performance on a year-to-date basis.

iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

This fund offers exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute semiconductors. Its top three holdings include Broadcom (7.82%), Nvidia (7.41%) and AMD (6.96%).

SOXX gained 3% in the last trading session and surged a solid 33.9% year to date. This fund charges 34 basis points (bps) as fees.

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ)

This fund provides exposure to the 30 largest U.S.-listed securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. Its top three holdings include Nvidia (11.03%), Broadcom (9.71%) and AMD (6.91%).

SOXX,AI Mania Drives Large-Cap Chip ETF To Unusual Overbought Levels  --  And Retail Traders Are Turning Cautious,,"The broader tech sector trades near record levels, with the upside driven by the optimism concerning artificial intelligence technology. The semiconductor industry, which manufactures chips that power AI applications and processes, has outperformed the tech industry as a whole, with most of these stocks trading at overbought levels.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), a BlackRock-sponsored exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks semiconductor stocks, has gained nearly 31% this year, outperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) (+18.5%) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) (+23%). The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), another semiconductor-focused ETF that is heavily weighted toward bigger chip stocks, has advanced a steeper 39% this year.

The gains have rendered these two chip-focused ETFs at overbought levels. The 14-day relative strength indices (RSI) for the SOXX and SMH ETFs are at 78 and 80, respectively. The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements and is used to spot potential buying or selling opportunities. A reading above 70 suggests that a stock has risen too far and too fast, and is ripe for a pullback.

According to a CNBC report, a reading above 80 is unusual for an ETF like SMH, and it has only breached this level three times in the past. On all three occasions, the six and 12-month forward returns have been negative. The performance was the worst in 2021, with the SMH ETF losing half of its value over the following year, as the ETF breached the ‘80’ threshold for the RSI. In June 2024, when this happened, the losses were a more modest 12% after six months and 5% after a year.

Within the industry, Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML (ASML), its U.S. peer Lam Research (LRCX), chip testing company Teradyne (TER) and memory chipmaker Micron (MU) are the most overbought, each having an RSI above 79.

AI has driven the valuation of semiconductor stocks, according to analysts at Citi, as reported by Proactive Investors. The firm believes these stocks have plenty of room to grow from a margin, revenue, inventory, and demand perspective. It sees accelerating growth for chip companies, thanks to higher pricing for the first time in 25 years. According to analysts, AI chip sales now account for a quarter of overall semiconductor sales.

The industry, however, faces headwinds from the Trump administration's crackdown on China. A Wall Street Journal report, published in late September, stated that the government is considering a plan to penalize companies that do not maintain a 1:1 ratio for domestic manufacturing versus imports. The White House has also restricted the export of advanced AI chips to China, one of the country's most significant consumers. In retaliation, China has intensified its efforts to support domestic chipmakers, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment toward the SMH ETF turned to ‘neutral’ (52/100) by late Sunday from ‘bullish’ the day before. The message volume, however, remained ‘high.’ The SOXX ETF has attracted ‘extremely bullish’ sentiment, with the buoyant mood accompanied by ‘high’ message volume. The divergence in sentiment points to potential broadening of buying interest to smaller semiconductor stocks.

In overnight trading, the SMH ETF rose 0.73% and the SOXX was up 0.57%, according to Yahoo Finance.",Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,2025-10-06T06:50:01Z,https://newsable.asianetnews.com/markets/ai-mania-drives-large-cap-chip-etf-to-unusual-overbought-levels-and-retail-traders-are-turning-cautious-articleshow-rx5fm5d,1.0,2025-10-25 14:02:05.471615,,0.2549019607843137
SOXX,7 Best Semiconductor ETFs to Buy in 2025 - WTOP News,,"In August, the U.S. government unofficially created a new breed of government-sponsored enterprise. Toward the end of that month, the Trump administration announced an $8.9 billion investment in Intel Corp. (ticker: INTC) common stock.

The funding was unconventional. It was financed with $5.7 billion in grants already awarded but not yet disbursed under the CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. This marked a notable departure from past policy, where grants and subsidies supported projects indirectly rather than the government taking direct equity stakes in public companies.

[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]

However, the Trump administration wasn’t the only one making headlines. Shortly after, competitor Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) announced a $5 billion investment in Intel stock. The two companies will be co-developing multiple generations of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, integrating Intel’s x86 platform with Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

At first glance, these developments may seem surprising, but they align with previously stated government priorities.

In February 2024, the “Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update” was released by the Fast Track Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies of the National Science and Technology Council. The report identified 18 critical technologies, including semiconductors.

For investors, geopolitical competition in the 21st century is therefore less about traditional strategic resources like oil and aluminum, and more about who can design and manufacture the cutting-edge chips that power modern economies and militaries.

Control is the key word, whether that’s governments now taking direct stakes in key companies or reshoring production to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains.

“Geopolitical tensions and tariffs have made semiconductor supply chains more complicated, driving companies toward diversifying and localizing manufacturing,” says Nick Frasse, product manager at asset manager VanEck.

While semiconductor valuations have already surged on AI capital expenditures from tech firms, these recent moves possibly point to a multiyear megacycle, fueled not only by private-sector demand but also by direct public investment, strategic partnerships and exponentially scaling tech advancements.

“Semiconductors continue to be a cornerstone for innovation, especially as AI models grow more powerful,” Frasse explains. “We’re closely watching compute and scaling laws — the trend of continuously increasing processing power — which strongly supports sustained semiconductor demand.”

Here are seven of the best semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to buy today:

ETF Expense ratio VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 0.35% iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) 0.34% Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ) 0.19% VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF (SMHX) 0.35% SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) 0.35% Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL) 0.75% Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (SOXS) 0.97%

VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

“The potential benefits of investing in semiconductor ETFs include exposure to a high-growth sector with strong fundamentals, diversification across multiple companies in the industry and the potential for long-term capital appreciation,” says Sean August, CEO of August Wealth Management Group. SMH is the poster child for this outperformance, having returned an annualized 29.3% over the past decade.

This ETF tracks the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which emphasizes market capitalization and liquidity for inclusion. Notably, Nvidia’s continued outperformance has resulted in the company now holding a 19% weight as SMH’s top holding. The next largest, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM), is only half as dominant, with a 9.7% weight. SMH charges a 0.35% expense ratio.

iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)

“When looking for semiconductor ETFs, investors should consider factors such as the expense ratio, the underlying index or benchmark, the fund’s holdings and diversification strategy, and the ETF’s historical performance,” August says. “It is also important to assess the fund’s liquidity and trading volume to ensure that it is easy to buy and sell.” The best semiconductor ETFs like SOXX possess all these traits.

SOXX tracks the NYSE Semiconductor Index, a benchmark of 30 U.S.-listed semiconductor companies weighted by market cap with some modifications and limits to make it less top heavy. It trades with a low 0.01% 30-day bid-ask spread and about 7 million shares a day, indicating very good liquidity. SOXX also charges a 0.34% expense ratio, which is fairly standard for this category.

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ)

“While certain segments of the semiconductor market, like memory, may be facing pressure due to oversupply concerns, the longer-term growth potential driven by advancements in AI, autonomous driving and high-performance computing remains strong,” says Rene Reyna, head of thematic and specialty product ETF strategy at Invesco. SOXQ is the firm’s answer to SMH and SOXQ.

The fund tracks the well-known PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, a market-cap weighted benchmark of 30 U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks. What makes SOXQ stand out is its cost. With a 0.19% expense ratio, a $10,000 investment results in an annual fee drag of just $19, compared to $34 or $35 for either SOXX or SMH. Because exposures are so similar, cost-conscious investors may prefer SOXQ.

VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF (SMHX)

“The semiconductor industry continues to evolve rapidly, driven by fabless companies that prioritize chip design and innovation while outsourcing production,” Frasse explains. “This model allows firms like Nvidia to invest heavily in research and development, keeping (capital expenditure) low and maintaining agility in responding to market shifts.” Investors can own fabless semiconductor stocks via SMHX.

Choosing SMHX over a broader fund like SMH helps mitigate geopolitical risk. The world’s largest semiconductor foundry is based in Taiwan, a region marked by ongoing geopolitical tensions and disputed sovereignty. By focusing on fabless companies that outsource manufacturing, SMHX reduces direct exposure to this risk. SMHX charges the same 0.35% expense ratio as SMH.

SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD)

Market-cap weighting assigns larger allocations to bigger companies, which for SMH results in one stock, such as Nvidia, accounting for nearly a fifth of the ETF. SOXX and SOXQ apply caps to limit exposure, but even there, a single stock can still make up around 10% of assets. For investors concerned about concentration risk, XSD offers an alternative by tracking the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index.

This index takes 40 semiconductor companies from the S&P Total Market Index and equally weights them at each quarterly rebalance. That means small- and mid-cap semiconductor stocks receive the same weighting as the largest players. As a result, the fund’s top holdings are simply those that have outperformed since the last rebalance. XSD charges a 0.35% expense ratio.

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL)

“Semiconductors are the engine powering the AI revolution and the modern global economy,” says Mo Sparks, chief product officer at Direxion. “Be it through trillion-dollar market caps, earnings surprises and misses, tariffs, or broader geopolitical events, today’s traders have plenty of catalysts and volatility to guide their daily conviction.” For traders bullish on semiconductor stocks, Direxion offers SOXL.

This ETF uses swaps to deliver a price return three times that of the NYSE Semiconductor Index. “Belief that AI and semiconductors will continue to drive economic expansion, paired with recent earnings that spotlighted continued opportunity and gigantic capex spending from technology companies, is likely all the conviction a bullish trader needs,” Sparks says. SOXL charges a 0.75% expense ratio.

Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (SOXS)

Semiconductor stocks trade at elevated valuations, making them a target for bearish traders anticipating a reversion to the mean. Traditional ways to bet against the sector include buying put options or short selling. Both approaches come with complications. For puts, time decay and changes in implied volatility can erode gains. For short selling, margin calls can arise if the stock price moves higher.

An alternative is buying shares of SOXS, the inverse counterpart to SOXL. The fund seeks to deliver three times the inverse of the daily return of the NYSE Semiconductor Index. Unlike shorting, the maximum loss is limited to the number of shares you own, and unlike puts, SOXS offers a leveraged directional bet without the need to account for option Greeks. That said, this vehicle carries its own risks and is not for beginners. The ETF charges a 0.97% expense ratio.

SOXX,"Micron's $9.2B Q4 Haul Sparks 8% Stock Rally, Signals AI Chip Boom | ABC Money",,"On September 25, 2025, Micron Technology Inc. shocked the semiconductor industry by saying that the Fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings were much higher than Wall Street’s projections, equivalent earnings per share were 2.15, and revenue had gone up by 18 per cent compared to the previous year.

The record performance of the memory chip giant, which is fueled by the unquenchable consumption of high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND flash in AI data centers, spawned an 8% surge in its shares in early trading, which hurled the stock to a new all-time high of more than 145, eliminating the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the sector after its initial hype.

With venture capitalists flooding in, the performance of Micron is indicative of the long-term AI tailwind, when larger markets are still treading water due to the continued inflationary worry. The beat is a welcome relief to Micron, which had just made it through the labyrinth of recovery from the 2023 decline in consumer electronics.

As AI hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Google continue to deploy more servers, the HBM3E memory modules that Micron strongly depends on in order to train the very large language models have order backlogs grow 40 per cent quarter-to-quarter.

CEO Sanjay Mehrota described the quarter as a turning point, and attributed the success to strategic investments in fabrication capacity in the U.S. Already up 66% year-to-year, the shares have a premium price; however, the momentum indicates that Micron will take additional share in the estimated 200 billion AI memory market by the year 2030.

Earnings Highlights: Revenue and Margins Exceed Forecasts Amid AI-Driven Growth

Micron’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, which ended on August 29, 2025, reflected excellent segment demand. Revenue of the data centre, which constitutes 55 per cent of the total sales, increased 45 per cent to $5.1 billion due to the sales of high-speed AI accelerators via advanced DRAM.

Shipments of NAND flash records were made, and automotive and industrial applications brought an unexpected 12% growth layer to balance the weaker consumer SSD demand. Pricing discipline and yield improvement at Idaho and Taiwan plants have helped Gross margins to increase to 38.5 per cent compared to 32 per cent a year ago.

In the future, Micron projected first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenue of $9.8 billion–stronger than the current $9.5 billion on the Street–and a 2.25 EPS, indicating continued growth. Capital spending will also increase 15% to 8.5 billion every year, with the focus on 1-gamma node development of next-gen HBM. The company also declared a two-billion share buyback program, which indicated that it believed in underestimation at 12-times forward earnings.

The success in this quarter is built on the mid-2025 turnaround at Micron. Following a bruised 2024 of inventory buildsups, the company took a swivel into AI, with a collaboration with Nvidia to integrate Blackwell GPUs, and units of companies having multi-year deals with Amazon Web Services. Free cash flow became positive at 1.2 billion and allowed the company to reduce its debt and accelerate the development of R&D in 3D stacking technology.

Market Frenzy: Micron is a Leader in the Chip Rally, a Wider Tech Industry Stampede

The profit announcement brought about an instant Wall Street euphoria. The shares of Micron that had ended at 134 the previous day opened 8.2 per cent higher at midday at 145.30, which is the biggest one-day move of the year since May. The volume shot to 25 million shares, which is much more than the average, with options traders thinking more gains lie ahead. Implied volatility shot up 15%.

The backlash euphoricized colleagues. Nvidia, the main client of Microchip maker, surged 3.1 per cent to $183, with fresh confirmation of AI chip orders. Digitalmpetitors, Western Digital and Seagate Technology, increased 5.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent, both on price tailwind expectations.

Samsung Electronics increased by 2.7 per cent in Seoul, and SK Hynix improved by 3.9 per cent, and analysts mentioned the performance of Micron as an indicator of how the major Asian memory firms will perform in the case of comparable AI falls.

Expansive indices moved a little higher. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 19,850, and semiconductors were the best performers with a rise of 0.4 per cent to 6,725. Sector-wide optimism was indicated by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) soaring 2.8, which matched its largest percentage rise in weeks.

Stocks that had gained on the day before remained steady, and consumer discretionary fell back in the buying apprehension of retail sales. The inflows of ETFs into the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) jumped up 2.5 per cent, and inflows reached $450 million.

Wall Street Roars Approval: Bullish Consensus Upgrades and Targets

Analysts did not take long to redefine their opinions. JPMorgan, which started covering it last month with an overweight rating, increased its price target to $160, rather than $150, on the basis of AI memory pricing having even greater upside. The implementation of Micron has decoupled the cycle, and the use of HBM has almost hit 100% usage, with the lead analyst Harlan Sur estimating 25% revenue growth in fiscal 2026.

Citi also increased its target to $155, from $140 and continued with a buy. The company noted that Micron has a competitive advantage in low-power DRAM to edge AI devices, which it expected to bring in EPS of $9.50 next year, which would be higher than the $7.20 consensus.

Micron is in the red with Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities increasing his target to $170 as the quarter he described as transformative, signifying a 17 per cent upside to the stock, suggesting the company is underestimated against Nvidia multiples.

The sentiment has shifted dramatically to the bullish: Out of 28 analysts followed by Bloomberg, 22 are rating it buy or outperform with an average of $152, 13 per cent above the present level. The growth in earnings is set at 45 per cent in fiscal 2026, which is higher than the average of 28 per cent with semiconductors.

There are not a lot of bears; UBS is neutral with a price of $135, fearing a possible oversupply, should AI hype die; however, even if they admit the strength in the near term. The renovations are reminiscent of the Micron storyline of the past year.

Since 2025, the stock has gained 66 per cent, which is 40 points above the SOX, but is still sold at a discount to historical levels. The institutional ownership reached 85%, and Vanguard and BlackRock have been able to add their positions in the last quarter.

Strategic Edge: Micron Bets on AI in a Competitive Space

The success of Micron is not a coincidence; it is the result of calculated risks related to AI infrastructure. With its U.S. expansion of up to 15 billion including a New York fab to manufacture advanced packaging, the company is in a position to grab CHIPs Act subsidies worth more than 6 billion.

Partnerships with TSMC to develop HBM4 technology together will achieve efficiency improvements of 30 per cent by 2027, taking away some of Samsung’s market. Issues remain: There is a threat of geopolitical unrest in Taiwan, where 70 per cent of NANDs are made, and there is also the problematic cyclical pricing.

But these are offset by the diversified presence of Micron, 40% of which is now located in the U.S., unlike the pure-play Asian competitors. Recycled water use in fabs, a sustainability program, is favoured by ESG funds that currently constitute 15 per cent of stocks.

Micron has had Intel and AMD, which are scrambling to match Nvidia in AI accelerators, in the wider chip wars, with its performance. Another unsung component in AI is also featured in the quarter: Micron is a necessity without high-speed cache, and GPU clusters are useless.

Global Implication: Powering AI Growth and Supply Chain

The wave of Micron resounds all over the world. It justifies the Taiwan semiconductor pivot in Asia, where TSMC stocks rose 1.2% on possible co-fab orders. U.S. policy victory as well: The outcome strengthens the onshoring drive by Biden, which could speed up $52 billion of grants. In Europe, the demand for lithography in Micron nodes has benefited from ASML by edging 0.9%.

The boom is an environmental flag-raiser in terms of energy consumption – data centres are a power guzzler – but Micron has designs of sub-voltage AI compute fabric that could reduce AI compute emissions by 20 per cent. In the case of the emerging markets, low-cost NAND allows AI in smartphones, and it is driving adoption in India and Brazil.

Investors’ Outlook: Riding the AI Wave with Calculated Risks

Micron offers a good entry point in its breakout in the case of portfolios. Bulls are aiming at 160 at the end of the year on the HBM ramp, diversified trades such as VanEck Semiconductor ETF will be ballast. Volatility looms in Fed speeches this week, but the AI secular trend persists.

Micron is not just making ends meet in the chip cycle – it is marking the era of AI. With shares coalescing after the rally, the word is simple: In the high-stakes game of memory, Micron has the keys to opening tomorrow.",ABC Money,2025-09-25T11:27:32Z,https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/2025/09/microns-9-2b-q4-haul-sparks-8-stock-rally-signals-ai-chip-boom/,1.0,2025-10-25 14:02:26.140259,,0.192156862745098

SOXX,Big Tech Keeps Spending Despite Rising AI Bubble Fears: ETFs in Focus,,"Bubble fears in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been doing the rounds for quite some time now. To add to the woes, a record number of global fund managers now believe that AI stocks are truly in bubble territory, according to Bank of America’s October survey, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.

About 54% of respondents flagged tech valuations as too high, marking a sharp reversal from last month, when nearly half ruled out such concerns. The latest poll was conducted between Oct. 3 and Oct. 9, and surveyed 166 participants with $400 billion in assets, the article revealed.

Nasdaq 100's Rally Fuels Valuation Fears

Driven by enthusiasm around AI spending and productivity gains, U.S. stocks have hit multiple records this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has surged about 17.6% this year, pushing its forward price-to-earnings ratio to nearly 28 — well above the decade average of 23. This has prompted some investors to question whether earnings expectations justify the rally, per the aforementioned Bloomberg article.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also struck a cautious tone on October 14, calling elevated asset prices “a category of concern,” as cited by Yahoo Finance.

Mixed Views on Tech Bubble Risk

While some market participants are growing wary, strategists at Goldman Sachs argue it’s premature to fear a full-blown tech bubble. Despite valuation concerns, equity allocations among fund managers have climbed to an eight-month high (BofA survey revealed), indicating underlying optimism, cited by the same Bloomberg article (read: Are Big Tech ETFs Strong Enough to Weather AI Bubble Fears?).

Still Bullish Tone Not Missing From the Market

According to State Street’s Risk Appetite Index, cited by DataTrek Research, large professional investors entered the fourth quarter as bullish as they’ve been all year, adding to riskier assets for five successive months, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.

Big Tech Bets Billions on AI Expansion Despite Bubble Worries

Big Tech companies are leaving no stone unturned to make the AI story bigger. Google (GOOGL, GOOG) announced a $15 billion investment in India to build its largest data center hub outside the United States. Meanwhile, AMD (AMD) shares surged on news of a new chip partnership with Oracle (ORCL).

OpenAI, in turn, has inked major chip and infrastructure deals with Broadcom, AMD, Oracle and NVIDIA. Walmart and OpenAI, too, joined forces to expand AI-powered retail tools (read: OpenAI's Dealmaking Spree Puts These ETFs in Focus).

How to Play the Mood in the Market?

Semiconductor ETFs

Semiconductor stocks have been the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. Chips facilitate data processing and model training at a massive scale. The more efficient the chips are, the faster and smarter the AI applications become.

Recently, big semiconductor companies inked back-to-back big-ticket deals with AI companies, which is expected to fuel chip ETFs like iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX. The ETF is up 28.7% this year (as of Oct. 14, 2025) (read: Chip ETFs: The Best Way to Profit from the AI Boom?).

Utilities ETFs

AI’s huge demand for energy boosts utilities’ growth prospects and the need for power infrastructure. Utilities benefit as data centers and AI operations drive electricity consumption higher. Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF XLU has added about 20% this year (as of Oct. 14, 2025).

Big Tech ETFs

Big tech stocks are cash-rich.Most companies have a high cash flow/share ratio and low debt-equity ratios. The combo calls for a good balance sheet position. A strong balance sheet acts as a safety net for companies. iShares US Technology ETF IYW has added about 22.1% so far this year.

SOXX,"Move Over, Nvidia -- Micron's Rally Just Rewired The AI ETF Playbook - Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (ARCA:CHAT), Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ)",,"Micron Technology Inc’s (NASDAQ:MU) fiscal Q4 profit beat on both the top and bottom line is placing the chipmaker under sharper focus for ETF investors seeking to catch the next wave of the semiconductor rally. The timing is especially noteworthy as investors in the industry’s bellwether, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA), look cautious following its own post-earnings decline.

MU stock is the underdog with a solid growth runway. Check its live prices here.

For bullish investors who want a direct leveraged bet on Micron’s stock performance, the Direxion Daily MU Bull 2X Shares (NASDAQ:MUU) enhances its gains for those who are optimistic about the company’s growth path. This ETF becomes more timely as Micron solidifies itself as a foundational AI beneficiary, not only playing the role of a chipmaker but standing out as the sole U.S.-based memory maker poised to address booming demand for high-performance DRAM and NAND solutions.

Micron’s most recent results reinforce that positioning. Micron reported $11.32 billion in revenue against consensus expectations of $11.15 billion, and earnings per share were $3.03, comfortably ahead of expectations of $2.84. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted record-breaking fiscal-year performance and reinforced Micron’s technology leadership by noting that its memory solutions are the building blocks for AI computing.

The AI narrative remains at the forefront. As artificial intelligence adoption increases, so does demand for sophisticated memory and data-handling capabilities. Micron, ranked seventh in the worldwide semiconductor industry, may sneak up on more investors as fund managers seek alternatives to Nvidia, whose explosive growth has fueled fears of overvaluation.

Broader ETF Exposure To Micron And Nvidia

In addition to individual stock holdings, investors can also obtain exposure to Micron and Nvidia via diversified AI-themed and semiconductor-based ETFs. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which covers 25 of the globe’s leading chipmakers, includes both Micron and Nvidia in its top holdings. Likewise, iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) offers diversified exposure to the sector where Nvidia will frequently hold disproportionate weight, and Micron represents diversification within memory solutions.

For investors seeking AI-focused plays, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) and the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSE:CHAT) both hold Nvidia, providing indirect exposure to artificial intelligence-led growth. These diversified vehicles enable investors to ride the semiconductor rally without speculating solely on one stock.

The comparison to Nvidia is especially interesting. Where Nvidia (P/E at almost 51) has been the poster child of AI infrastructure, worries are growing that its shares have already factored in years of growth to come. Micron, on the other hand, remains under the radar, with its valuation less extended (P/E at almost 22), and its product mix directly correlated with accelerating AI demand.

For traders of ETFs, this creates the stage for new possibilities. Vehicles such as MUU enable participants to bet on Micron’s momentum with leverage, while more extensive ETFs such as SMH and SOXX provide a vehicle to take advantage of gains from both Micron and Nvidia in one package. As the chip giants’ market adjusts its ardor between them, Micron’s ETFs could be the silent winners of a shifting semiconductor landscape.

SOXX,Chip ETFs: The Best Way to Profit from the AI Boom?,,"Chip stocks bounced back strongly yesterday, recovering their losses from Friday, mainly due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and Broadcom’s major AI deal.

Semiconductor stocks have been the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as these companies provide the “picks and shovels” for the AI gold rush.

Semiconductor ETFs are also among the best-performing ETFs of the past decade, as chips, the fundamental building blocks of computation, have become integral to everything from smartphones to cars, laptops, PCs, video games, and data centers.

Chip Megadeals: Bubble or Boom?

Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI announced a strategic partnership under which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. The investment will support new data centers with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The Trump administration has also approved some Nvidia chip exports to the UAE.

AMD (AMD) shares have surged recently after the chip designer announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with OpenAI on data centers that will use AMD chips. Under the deal, OpenAI will purchase six gigawatts’ worth of AMD chips and receive about a 10% equity stake in AMD, granted in phases upon reaching certain milestones.

AMD has long been viewed as a distant second in the AI chip market, which is dominated by Nvidia with more than a 75% market share.

OpenAI and Broadcom (AVGO) also announced a partnership to develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips and computing systems over four years. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Intel (INTC), which lost its edge years ago to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), received a boost as Nvidia invests $5 billion in Intel.

The investment follows the U.S. government’s 10% stake in Intel, now worth about 50% more due to the company’s stock rally. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have supported Intel to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing.

OpenAI estimates that one gigawatt of capacity costs about $50 billion to bring online, with roughly two-thirds of that spent on chips, hardware, and infrastructure, according to the Financial Times.

AMD’s stock has now entered the ‘extremely overbought’ territory, given the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) currently at 81.16, according to Koyfin. A reading above 70 for the RSI suggests the stock could be ripe for a pullback.

AMD received more love from Wall Street, with the stock snagging another bullish upgrade. DBS Bank upgraded AMD’s stock to ‘Buy’ from ‘Hold’ and assigned a $260 price target, the Fly reported. Piper Sandler, Truist, BofA, Evercore ISI, Morgan Stanley, Citi, UBS, Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Sifel, and Melius Research were among the firms that upped their respective price targets for the stock. The updated price targets ranged from $215 to $300, with the upper bound implying an additional 42% upside potential from Tuesday’s close.

Most analysts viewed the OpenAI deal as pointing toward potential broader adoption of AMD’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips across OpenAI’s cloud service provider partners and among other players. Specifically, Evercore ISI said the OpenAI deal could boost AMD’s 2027 earnings per share (EPS) by over $2 and 2028 EPS by over $4. Morgan Stanley, while sounding optimistic about the MI450 ecosystem, cautioned that the Lisa Su-led company needs to prove that it can deliver better return on investment (ROI) than Nvidia.

A user on X pointed out that AMD’s MI450 chips would utilize 2nm processor node technology, as opposed to Nvidia’s Rubin, which would use 3nm, giving the former a significant power and efficiency advantage.

On Stocktwits, retail optimism about AMD tempered a bit, dropping a few notches but stayed in ‘extremely bullish’ territory, while the message volume on the stream remained ‘extremely high.’ AMD is among the trending stocks on the platform.

A bullish user stated that the stock should be trading at least at $260 based on technical analysis.

Another user stated that a $300 stock price is around the corner, with the prediction aligning with the Street-high AMD price target.

SOXX,"Intel Jolts New Life Into Semiconductor ETFs: 3 Funds To Watch - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)",,"Semiconductor ETFs are receiving a new jolt of energy from the most unlikely of places, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC).

The chipmaker’s stronger-than-expected third-quarter results have propelled its stock higher and put a spotlight back on ETFs exposed to Intel, which has long lagged behind the likes of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) in the AI bonanza.

INTC is up on earnings surprise. Check the price analysis here.

Funds like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:XSD) are among the biggest winners of Intel’s surprise breakout.

SMH and SOXX traditionally skewed heavier on Nvidia and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). Yet, Intel is a top-10 holding in each.

In contrast, XSD’s equal weight provides the chipmaker with a more diversified representation, setting it up to gain more evenly from Intel’s gains post-earnings. Each of the three ETFs were up around 1.5% Friday morning.

Investors speculating on more general AI hardware exposure can also see secondary benefit in thematic ETFs like the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ), which follow big U.S. chipmakers across the computing, data center, and AI infrastructure segments. This fund is up by more than 2% today, buoyed by Intel’s EPS gains.

Intel’s third-quarter results provided a welcome upside surprise. The firm reported revenue of $13.65 billion, exceeding estimates of $13.14 billion. Its adjusted earnings of 23 cents per share contrasted with expectations of just one cent. Stocks surged following the print, indicating fresh hopes that the chipmaker is ultimately beginning to turn a corner.

CEO Lip-Bu Tan emphasized the ways in which AI is accelerating demand for compute and expanding opportunities through Intel’s x86 platforms and foundry services. Not all segments performed up to mark: Data center and AI revenue declined 1% year-over-year, and foundry sales fell 2%.

For the moment, Intel’s turnaround suggests a more balanced act for semiconductor ETFs. The ultimate test? Whether Intel’s new momentum can sustain itself beyond one earnings cycle.

SOXX,"AMD's AI Ambitions Clash With Chip Leak Jitters; Semiconductor ETFs Falter - Roundhill ETF Trust Roundhill AMD WeeklyPay ETF (BATS:AMDW), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)",,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is back in the news, and not quite for the reasons it likely wishes. Following a fleeting optimism at last week’s OCP Conference, which sparked bullish calls from analysts and AI hype excitement, AMD shares declined by around 2% on Tuesday as hardware leaks revealed unconfirmed specifications of future Ryzen chips. The conflicting messages have reverberated through semiconductor-themed ETFs, leaving investors in an arbitration mode between long-term AI promise and short-term market anxiety.

AMD is in the red today. Check its live prices.

Chip Leaks Cloud Near-Term Sentiment

The rumors, leaked by tipster chi11eddog, spoke of two future-gen chips, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D2, with record-breaking L3 cache and scorching clock speeds. But since AMD hasn’t ratified the facts, the market was conservative in its response.

On Tuesday, the Roundhill AMD WeeklyPay ETF (BATS:AMDW) fell almost 3%, and the Direxion Daily AMD Bull 2X Shares (NASDAQ:AMUU) lost around 1.4%. Larger semiconductor funds weren’t safe from the drop — the Direxion Daily Semiconductors Top 5 Bull 2X ETF (TSXU) fell 3.5%, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) inched down 0.5%.

In the meantime, the company’s increasing importance in artificial intelligence is the more compelling narrative.

AI Momentum Still Intact

At San Jose’s OCP Conference, AMD demonstrated its MI450 Series GPUs, Venice CPUs, and Vulcano DPUs, all optimized for hyperscale AI workloads. Oracle confirmed that it will be deploying 50,000 MI450 GPUs within the next year, and AMD’s alignment with Meta’s data center architecture could reveal multi-billion-dollar opportunities.

Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, ranked among the top 3% of stock experts, sees potential GPU revenues of $15–20 billion per gigawatt of deployment, with OpenAI's first such project expected to launch in late 2026.

Bottom Line

For AMD and leveraged ETFs, this week serves as a reminder that when rumors of hardware collide with AI mania, volatility is not a bug; it’s a feature. In switchback fashion, as investors alternate between speculation and conviction, one thing is certain: AMD’s dual role as a gaming and AI giant keeps semiconductor ETFs far from dull.

SOXX,AMD Stock Surges on OpenAI Deal,,"Any questions about the durability of the AI revolution can be set aside for today after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and ChatGPT operator OpenAI announced a deal to collaborate on the construction of AI data centers to be run on AMD chips.

AMD stock soared as much as 37.6% Monday, and semiconductor stocks, as represented by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), were up nearly 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 1%, its dominant position in the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout somewhat undermined.

AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said in a statement that the agreement will support ""the world's most ambitious AI buildout."" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the partnership with AMD ""is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential.""

According to terms of a strategic partnership announced by both parties, OpenAI will buy 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD chips, beginning with AMD's next-generation MI450 processor set for deployment in the second half of 2026.

The companies did not provide an estimated total value for the agreement, though Dr. Su said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the deal will generate tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for AMD over the next five years.

Advanced Micro Devices has also granted OpenAI a warrant for as many as 160 million AMD shares, approximately 10% of its outstanding stock, at a price of 1 cent per share. Vesting is tied to a rising AMD share price.

As Dr. Su explained, ""OpenAI actually has to do a lot of work to make sure our deployments are successful. We wanted to make sure they were motivated in the sense that OpenAI would be motivated for AMD to be successful.""

AMD CFO Jean Hu said the agreement ""is expected to be highly accretive to AMD's non-GAAP earnings-per-share."" AMD stock had already risen more than 36% for the year to date through the closing bell on Friday, October 3.

""We are in a phase of the build-out where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well,"" Altman said. ""You'll see this on chips. You'll see this on data centers. You'll see this lower down the supply chain.""

""The AI narrative continues to gain momentum,"" said Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates. ""This gives some competition for NVIDIA, which currently dominates AI chips, and accelerates the timeline for data center buildouts.

SOXX,Marvell Tech To Buyback Almost 10% Of Outstanding Stock,,"Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares rose Wednesday after the chipmaker unveiled a fresh capital return plan and highlighted its growing focus on data center and AI infrastructure. The company said its board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization and disclosed an accelerated share repurchase agreement.

Marvell’s board cleared a new buyback program totaling $5 billion. As of Aug. 2, 2025, the company had about $2.0 billion remaining under its prior repurchase authorization. Since then, it has bought back $300 million of stock this quarter under its regular program and entered an accelerated share repurchase with a leading financial institution to retire $1 billion of shares.

With a current market capitalization of roughly $64.33 billion, the total buyback quantum, including the new $5 billion plan, $1 billion under the accelerated share repurchase, and $700 million left from the previous program, comes to approximately $6.7 billion, or about 10% of the company’s market value.

“This ASR reflects our conviction in the business and the intrinsic value of our stock, as we drive sustained revenue and cash flow growth,” said Matt Murphy, chairman and CEO of Marvell.

“Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to continue investing in long-term growth, particularly as we pursue the large and expanding opportunity in accelerated infrastructure for AI,” the CEO added.

According to Benzinga Pro, MRVL stock has gained over 8% in the past year. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).

SOXX,The 5 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks of the Last Decade -- Including Nvidia and Broadcom,,"Key Points

Each of these stocks is heavily involved in technology.

Most are profiting from a growing need for semiconductor chips and data centers.

That growth is being powered, in large part, by the spread of artificial intelligence.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

A stock's past performance does not guarantee any kind of future returns. But it's not crazy to look at the best-performing stocks over some period to see which companies were on fire -- and then to dive into them to see how promising their growth potential appears to be.

Here, then, is a quick review of the five best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past decade. Note that since they're from the S&P 500 index of 500 of America's biggest companies, these will not be small enterprises.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

1. Nvidia, up 26,927%

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the 800-pound gorilla in the semiconductor world, with a recent market value of $4.4 trillion -- a not-entirely surprising size, given its torrid growth in recent years. That total growth amounts to an average annual rate of about 75%.

Long known as a gaming-chip company, Nvidia is now heavily involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and is cranking out chips for data centers. One tailwind is a partnership with AI giant OpenAI.

Can Nvidia keep growing? Certainly, though most likely not quite as rapidly. Its stock appears reasonably valued, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, well below the five-year average of 39.

2. Advanced Micro Devices, up 10,971%

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is another major semiconductor company, and its average annual growth rate over the past decade comes out to an impressive 60%. (For context, know that the S&P 500 index has averaged annual gains of close to 10% over many decades and close to 15% over the past 10 years.)

AMD also has a partnership with OpenAI, which will help it keep growing -- in part via chips for data centers. One of its specialties is chips for PC CPUs, and it has been taking market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in that arena.

Shares of AMD are also reasonably valued, with a recent forward P/E of 35, a bit above their five-year average of 30.

3. Broadcom, up 3,666%

Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has been growing in value over the past decade by an average annual rate of nearly 41%. Yes, it's another semiconductor company, but also one that churns out software, with its offerings spanning wireless and wired technology, optical products, mainframe software, cybersecurity, and storage, among other things. It's set to benefit from the growth of AI, too, with its AI division growing briskly.

Broadcom's third quarter featured revenue up 22% year over year, and management expects fourth-quarter revenue to be up 24%. With a recent forward P/E of 37, well above the five-year average of 19, the stock looks overvalued. It could still deliver a solid performance for long-term investors, though. If you're nervous about the stock's valuation, you might just add it to your watch list or buy into it incrementally over time.

4. Arista Networks, up 3,253%

Shares of Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) have grown at an average annual rate of 42% over the past decade. The company specializes in networking equipment, such as the kind used by data centers. Its second quarter featured revenue growth of 30% year over year, but some have been disappointed that management projections for long-term growth aren't more robust.

With a recent forward P/E ratio of 42, well above the five-year average of 32, shares seem a bit overvalued, so invest with caution or do so incrementally over time, or just add the stock to your watchlist.

5. Axon Enterprise, up 2890%

Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON) has averaged annual gains of nearly 41% over the past decade, and it's not a specialist in chips or data centers -- though it's investing in AI. It offers hardware and software for public safety, with a cloud-based platform. Specifically, it sells body cameras, in-car cameras for police, tasers, drones, and more.

Its shares definitely appear overvalued, with a recent forward P/E of 83 well above the five-year average of 74 -- which is also steep. Its price-to-sales ratio, recently nearly 24, is also very steep, and nearly twice the five-year average of 13. Shares could keep growing from here, but they may also pull back to a more reasonable level.

Playing it safer -- via an ETF

If this list has you wanting to be invested in semiconductor- and data center-related stocks, you might want to consider opting for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will have you invested in a bunch of them. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), for example, encompasses around 30 stocks, with top ones including AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia.

In an interview by CNBC, the analyst suggested that

Quick Insights

Trade tensions are a negative for semiconductor ETFs, but ongoing negotiations may limit long-term damage and growth is expected to continue.

The probe mostly affects Qualcomm's small auto division and is unlikely to affect its main smartphone business, so revenue impact is minimal.

NVIDIA is not seen as overvalued due to its strong growth rates and central role in the global computing ecosystem.

SOXX,"Tech Weekly: Tech Stocks React to Fed, AI News and Geopolitical Tensions",,"This week’s market action reflected renewed caution amid evolving signals from the US Federal Reserve, with tech stocks facing pressure from shifting interest rate expectations and renewed overvaluation concerns.

Artificial intelligence (AI) heavyweight NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a US$100 billion investment partnership with OpenAI on Monday (September 22), deploying at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA-powered data centers.

The initial US$10 billion investment will occur once the first gigawatt is operational in late 2026. OpenAI will purchase chips from NVIDIA with this investment, and NVIDIA will receive non-controlling equity in OpenAI.

The news was initially met with optimistic market sentiment, buoying NVIDIA shares and related AI-focused tech stocks.

Similarly, data center developers experienced a surge in their stock prices due to the increasing need for AI infrastructure. This was further fueled by announcements of significant expansion projects, such as the Stargate initiative. This rally hasn’t translated to ongoing price momentum at this point.

Global markets gained ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Tuesday (September 23) remarks, in Providence, Rhode Island, during which he offered cautious guidance and dimmed hopes for near-term rate cuts.

Meanwhile, Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index (INDEXTSI:OSPTX) marked a milestone, breaking 30,000.

The milestone came as Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem stressed the urgent need for economic reforms to counteract risks from US trade protectionism and the US dollar's declining safe-haven status.

A more cautious tone emerged midweek, with analysts and investors weighing potential risks around the scale of the deal, including concerns about circular financing and renewed questions about market concentration.

Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) issuance of US$18 billion in public debt to expand its AI data center operations fueled concerns about escalating leverage risks. Meanwhile, at the macro leve, factors such as stronger-than-expected US unemployment numbers, and geopolitical tension after US President Donald Trump’s contentious remarks at the UN General Assembly, contributed to a market pause. Major US indexes marked their third straight day of losses on Thursday (September 25), with the tech sector bearing much of the brunt.

Chart via Nasdaq.

Nasdaq-100 performance, September 19 to 26, 2025.

The market rebounded slightly on Friday (September 26) as the latest US personal consumption expenditures index data aligned with expectations, giving investors relief and a sense of continued stability.

The Nasdaq-100 (INDEXNASDAQ:NDX) and S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) posted modest losses for the week, reflecting a wait-and-see mood heading into the fourth quarter.

3 tech stocks that moved markets this week

1. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Share price performance: Shares of Apple have risen 11.45 percent since September 12 pre-orders, positively impacted by strong iPhone 17 sales exceeding expectations.

News highlights: Demand for entry-level iPhone 17 models remains robust, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts noting possible implications from extended delivery times.

2. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Share price performance: Shares of Intel rose 19.65 percent this week as the legacy tech company continued to strengthen its market position.

News highlights: After securing funding from NVIDIA last week, Intel is reportedly seeking investment from Apple for its struggling chipmaking business, which is partly US government-owned. Early discussions also included closer collaboration between Apple and Intel, though an agreement is not guaranteed. Intel has also reportedly approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).

3. GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS)

Share price performance: GlobalFoundries, a major US-based semiconductor manufacturer with significant domestic fabrication capacity, jumped as much as 11.49 percent on Friday after reports emerged of a new 1 to 1 ratio mandate.

News highlights: The US said it is planning to implement a 1:1 chip production rule to reduce reliance on overseas semiconductor supply. Under this proposal, chip manufacturers would be required to produce domestically as many semiconductors as their customers import from foreign suppliers. Companies failing to maintain this 1:1 domestic-to-import production ratio over time may face tariffs.

SOXX,"More Pain Ahead For Apple, Dell? Trump Administration Weighs Tougher Rules To Push Domestic Manufacturing",,"The semiconductor industry is likely to face pushback, as a report suggests that the Trump administration is considering a more stringent plan to bring chip manufacturing onshore.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

A Wall Street Journal report, citing people familiar with the concept, stated that the new plan envisions penalizing companies that don’t maintain a 1:1 ratio for domestic manufacturing versus imports, with tariffs. The rumored plan aligns with a past message from President Donald Trump that semiconductor companies that don’t invest more in the U.S. would be slapped with tariffs as much as 100%.

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) continued to attract ‘bullish’ sentiment (57/100) from among the retail users of Stocktwits. The message volume on the stream was at ‘high’ levels.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly discussed the plan with semiconductor industry executives, emphasizing to them the importance of the measure in ensuring economic security. The U.S. companies now source much of their chip needs from overseas, particularly Taiwan, which is seen as vulnerable to Chinese aggression or natural calamities.

The report stated that the implementation of the plan could face challenges, as it would be difficult to determine the tariffs on products powered by chips made in the U.S. but assembled abroad.

Sources told the Journal that if a company can guarantee manufacturing one million chips in the U.S., it would be credited with that amount. Over time, this credit can be used by the company and its customers to import without any levy until its plant comes online in the U.S. That said, the companies could be given some grace period initially to adjust their U.S. manufacturing capacity.

Companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Dell Technologies (DELL), which source components from various parts of the world, could be among the most severely affected, according to the report. These companies may have to track the number of chips they source from overseas and match the numbers in the U.S. On the other hand, the new plan could be a positive for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Micron Technology (MU), and GlobalFoundries (GFS), which have all increased their U.S. production capacity.",Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd,2025-09-26T06:50:02Z,https://newsable.asianetnews.com/markets/more-pain-ahead-for-apple-dell-trump-administration-weighs-tougher-rules-to-push-domestic-manufacturing-articleshow-ru34hl5,0.6,2025-10-25 14:02:21.664877,,0.1529411764705881
SOXX,Marvell Tech To Buyback Almost 10% Of Outstanding Stock - Marvell Tech (NASDAQ:MRVL),,"Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares rose Wednesday after the chipmaker unveiled a fresh capital return plan and highlighted its growing focus on data center and AI infrastructure. The company said its board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization and disclosed an accelerated share repurchase agreement.

Marvell’s board cleared a new buyback program totaling $5 billion. As of Aug. 2, 2025, the company had about $2.0 billion remaining under its prior repurchase authorization. Since then, it has bought back $300 million of stock this quarter under its regular program and entered an accelerated share repurchase with a leading financial institution to retire $1 billion of shares.

With a current market capitalization of roughly $64.33 billion, the total buyback quantum, including the new $5 billion plan, $1 billion under the accelerated share repurchase, and $700 million left from the previous program, comes to approximately $6.7 billion, or about 10% of the company’s market value.

“This ASR reflects our conviction in the business and the intrinsic value of our stock, as we drive sustained revenue and cash flow growth,” said Matt Murphy, chairman and CEO of Marvell.

“Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to continue investing in long-term growth, particularly as we pursue the large and expanding opportunity in accelerated infrastructure for AI,” the CEO added.

According to Benzinga Pro, MRVL stock has gained over 8% in the past year. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).

The company recently closed the $2.5 billion, all-cash sale of its automotive Ethernet business, sharpening its emphasis on data center and artificial intelligence markets.

Management said the data center segment now represents 74% of total revenue, rising 69% year over year, underscoring where the firm sees its most durable growth opportunity.

Outlook And Investor Calendar

On Aug. 28, Marvell guided for third-quarter adjusted earnings of 69 cents to 79 cents per share and revenue between $1.957 billion and $2.163 billion.

SOXX,The 5 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks of the Last Decade -- Including Nvidia and Broadcom,,"A stock's past performance does not guarantee any kind of future returns. But it's not crazy to look at the best-performing stocks over some period to see which companies were on fire -- and then to dive into them to see how promising their growth potential appears to be.

Here, then, is a quick review of the five best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past decade. Note that since they're from the S&P 500 index of 500 of America's biggest companies, these will not be small enterprises.

1. Nvidia, up 26,927%

Nvidia (NVDA +2.26%) is the 800-pound gorilla in the semiconductor world, with a recent market value of $4.4 trillion -- a not-entirely surprising size, given its torrid growth in recent years. That total growth amounts to an average annual rate of about 75%.

Long known as a gaming-chip company, Nvidia is now heavily involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and is cranking out chips for data centers. One tailwind is a partnership with AI giant OpenAI.

Can Nvidia keep growing? Certainly, though most likely not quite as rapidly. Its stock appears reasonably valued, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, well below the five-year average of 39.

2. Advanced Micro Devices, up 10,971%

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD +7.63%) is another major semiconductor company, and its average annual growth rate over the past decade comes out to an impressive 60%. (For context, know that the S&P 500 index has averaged annual gains of close to 10% over many decades and close to 15% over the past 10 years.)

AMD also has a partnership with OpenAI, which will help it keep growing -- in part via chips for data centers. One of its specialties is chips for PC CPUs, and it has been taking market share from Intel (INTC +0.31%) in that arena.

Shares of AMD are also reasonably valued, with a recent forward P/E of 35, a bit above their five-year average of 30.

3. Broadcom, up 3,666%

Broadcom (AVGO +2.86%) has been growing in value over the past decade by an average annual rate of nearly 41%. Yes, it's another semiconductor company, but also one that churns out software, with its offerings spanning wireless and wired technology, optical products, mainframe software, cybersecurity, and storage, among other things. It's set to benefit from the growth of AI, too, with its AI division growing briskly.

Broadcom's third quarter featured revenue up 22% year over year, and management expects fourth-quarter revenue to be up 24%. With a recent forward P/E of 37, well above the five-year average of 19, the stock looks overvalued. It could still deliver a solid performance for long-term investors, though. If you're nervous about the stock's valuation, you might just add it to your watch list or buy into it incrementally over time.

4. Arista Networks, up 3,253%

Shares of Arista Networks (ANET +1.02%) have grown at an average annual rate of 42% over the past decade. The company specializes in networking equipment, such as the kind used by data centers. Its second quarter featured revenue growth of 30% year over year, but some have been disappointed that management projections for long-term growth aren't more robust.

5. Axon Enterprise, up 2890%

Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON) has averaged annual gains of nearly 41% over the past decade, and it's not a specialist in chips or data centers -- though it's investing in AI. It offers hardware and software for public safety, with a cloud-based platform. Specifically, it sells body cameras, in-car cameras for police, tasers, drones, and more.

Its shares definitely appear overvalued, with a recent forward P/E of 83 well above the five-year average of 74 -- which is also steep. Its price-to-sales ratio, recently nearly 24, is also very steep, and nearly twice the five-year average of 13. Shares could keep growing from here, but they may also pull back to a more reasonable level.

Playing it safer -- via an ETF",The Motley Fool,2025-10-19T11:15:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/19/the-5-best-performing-sp-500-stocks-of-last-decade/,0.5,2025-10-25 14:01:21.183373,,0.223529411764706
SOXX,"How Nvidia's Gulf AI Ambitions Could Reshape US Semiconductor ETFs - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ)",,"The U.S. government's recent approval of Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chip exports to the United Arab Emirates marks a significant milestone in global AI geopolitics, and a potential tailwind for investors in semiconductor and tech-focused ETFs. Under a bilateral AI agreement from May, the UAE will receive advanced Nvidia chips while committing to invest $1.4 trillion in U.S. projects over the next decade.

For ETF holders, this is the possibility of a structural reconfiguration of the semiconductor environment, with multiple-spillover effects to various ETFs.

Semiconductor ETFs

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) are both heavily concentrated in Nvidia, so they are direct recipients of any worldwide growth in the chipmaker’s business. SOXX, for example, has about 7.2% of its portfolio dedicated to Nvidia, and SMH has around 18.4%. More chip shipments to the UAE and the possible adoption in Gulf AI initiatives could drive Nvidia’s revenues higher, which could in turn have a positive effect on these ETFs.

Investors in these ETFs are essentially acquiring indirect exposure to U.S.-UAE AI statecraft.

Broader Tech ETFs

Wider tech ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) and Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) also contain substantial Nvidia exposure. Although more diversified than SMH or SOXX, Nvidia’s increasing involvement in global AI infrastructure projects, particularly the $1.4 trillion investment commitment by the UAE, may impact their overall performance. Also, concentration of Nvidia shares are high in both the funds, with around 10% and 14.6% weightage, respectively.

QQQ’s addition of mega-cap technology stocks will make Nvidia’s foreign growth and AI alliances potentially subtly influence ETF inflows, particularly from investors with an interest in AI adoption and overseas expansion stories.

AI-Thematic ETFs: BOTZ and ROBO

AI-dedicated ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ) and ROBO Global Robotics & Automation ETF (NYSE:ROBO) follow firms that stand to gain from AI infrastructure expansion abroad. Nvidia is at the top of BOTZ’s holdings list, at 11%. Although ROBO carries a much smaller weightage in Nvidia, the Nvidia-driven AI projects in the UAE have the potential to boost demand for AI hardware, cloud computing, and automation technology, thus driving several holdings in these ETFs.

For thematic ETF investors, the U.S.-UAE AI alliance marks a new front for AI deployment beyond domestic U.S. markets, a possible long-term thematic tech driver.

Takeaway For ETF Investors

The Nvidia-UAE agreement demonstrates the influence geopolitics can have on ETF performance. Semiconductor ETFs receive direct exposure to Nvidia’s foreign chip sales, broader technology ETFs potentially gain secondary investment inflows, and AI/thematic ETFs can gain from increased use of AI infrastructure.

Investors looking for diversified exposure to Nvidia-led growth may look to a combination of semiconductor, tech, and AI-themed ETFs to target both direct and indirect effects of this groundbreaking AI collaboration.

One customer has also entrusted SCHMID Group with managing an entire production line, highlighting trust in its technology and services.

AI servers require high-bandwidth memory stacks and co-packaged optics, boosting the need for sophisticated IC-substrate and PCB solutions.

SCHMID's V+, H+, and C+ systems are built to deliver precision, scalability, and support for next-generation AI server designs, giving it a competitive edge.

Executive Commentary

Roland Rettenmeier, Chief Sales Officer of SCHMID Group, said, “These orders mark a pivotal milestone for SCHMID Group. They demonstrate that our technology is needed and trusted not only in IC-substrates, but also in full PCB production lines for AI-Server-Board, one of the fastest growing and most demanding markets worldwide.”

He noted that AI server boards have short lifecycles of 18-24 months, creating recurring demand for advanced PCB solutions.

Securing these projects positions SCHMID Group at the center of the rapidly expanding AI hardware market. Each new generation of AI server boards demands more layers, smaller features, and new materials, where SCHMID's equipment provides a clear advantage and strengthens long-term market relevance.

Industry Growth Forecasts

AI adoption is fueling unprecedented demand for high-performance electronics. IDC projects the semiconductor industry will hit $785.5 billion in 2025 and could surpass $1.1 trillion by 2029.

TrendForce forecasts global AI server shipments will rise 24.3% in 2025, powered by North American cloud providers and sovereign cloud initiatives in Europe and the Middle East.

Related exchange-traded funds include the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).

Price Action: SHMD shares were trading higher by 4.71% to $4.220 premarket at last check Wednesday.

A role player in the age of AI

Daniel Foelber: The iShares Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to semiconductor designers, manufacturers, and equipment suppliers that are underrepresented by technology sector ETFs and many growth ETFs.

As you can see in the table, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds meaningful positions in companies that are underrepresented in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. And while Nvidia and Broadcom make up just shy of 20% of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, the other eight semiconductor stocks in the table, including AMD, are absent from the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.

A common issue with growth ETFs is that they tend to concentrate heavily on a handful of industry-leading names. The iShares Semiconductor ETF doesn't have that issue. It's an ideal choice for investors looking for exposure to the entire semiconductor value chain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention, but it's just one use case of semiconductors.

For example, Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are used in many Android devices that run Alphabet's software. AI is Micron's fastest-growing segment, but PC and mobile devices are still the primary use cases for its memory chips. Texas Instruments makes analog and embedded semiconductors that are used in consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare applications, and more.

Fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing include equipment made by companies like Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and KLA. Combined, these five companies make up 22.6% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. But Taiwan Semi and ASML are absent from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF because they aren't U.S. companies. And Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA combined only make up less than 4% of the iShares U.S. Technology ETF.

In sum, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great buy for investors looking for an ETF with exposure to the integrated semiconductor value chain rather than just a few popular names.

Even chip lovers should think twice in this economy

Anders Bylund: Buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a bold bet on a very specific high-growth industry. I'm usually all for that type of targeted investment. Things are different in the fall of 2025, though.

I still think of the AI boom as a positive market force. It's not a bubble, and the chip stocks that have soared due to great AI-related sales in the last three years have earned their lofty valuations. At the same time, even legendary bull runs usually have a couple of sharp price corrections along the way. That's particularly true when the bulls are racing in the middle of a shaky global economy.

On that note, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is too narrowly focused for my taste in this economy. I mean, even the classic S&P 500 funds look too concentrated since 27.8% of their total value comes from the top five holdings (including semiconductor king Nvidia in the top spot, of course). The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes this focus one step further. It holds just 30 stocks, and the top five names add up to 33.6% of the portfolio's assets under management (AUM).

Again, I'm usually fine with sector-specific ETFs. This just doesn't look like a good time to load up on this richly valued ETF. The ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 37 with a meager 0.7% dividend yield and a lofty beta value of 1.6. In other words, it's both expensive and volatile. I'd much rather put my investable cash to work in a tried-and-true market-wide tracker like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now.

I will surely consider hyper-targeted ETFs like the iShares Semiconductor ETF again someday. The same AI boom will probably still be in full force when I do. I just need the economy to calm down before I can commit to a swaggering AI-chip fund again. For now, I'm more interested in risk management.

But the semiconductor industry within the tech sector has done even better.

The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX +1.65%) is up a staggering 191% over the last five years. There's a lot more to the fund's success than its exposure to well-known names like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.

These two Motley Fool contributors discuss why the exchange-traded fund (ETF) may still be a good buy even after its massive run-up, as well as reasons to be cautious when approaching red-hot chip stocks at all-time highs.

A role player in the age of AI

Daniel Foelber: The iShares Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to semiconductor designers, manufacturers, and equipment suppliers that are underrepresented by technology sector ETFs and many growth ETFs.

As you can see in the table, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds meaningful positions in companies that are underrepresented in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. And while Nvidia and Broadcom make up just shy of 20% of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, the other eight semiconductor stocks in the table, including AMD, are absent from the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.

A common issue with growth ETFs is that they tend to concentrate heavily on a handful of industry-leading names. The iShares Semiconductor ETF doesn't have that issue. It's an ideal choice for investors looking for exposure to the entire semiconductor value chain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention, but it's just one use case of semiconductors.

For example, Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are used in many Android devices that run Alphabet's software. AI is Micron's fastest-growing segment, but PC and mobile devices are still the primary use cases for its memory chips. Texas Instruments makes analog and embedded semiconductors that are used in consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare applications, and more.

Fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing include equipment made by companies like Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and KLA. Combined, these five companies make up 22.6% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. But Taiwan Semi and ASML are absent from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF because they aren't U.S. companies. And Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA combined only make up less than 4% of the iShares U.S. Technology ETF.

In sum, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great buy for investors looking for an ETF with exposure to the integrated semiconductor value chain rather than just a few popular names.

Even chip lovers should think twice in this economy

Anders Bylund: Buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a bold bet on a very specific high-growth industry. I'm usually all for that type of targeted investment. Things are different in the fall of 2025, though.

I still think of the AI boom as a positive market force. It's not a bubble, and the chip stocks that have soared due to great AI-related sales in the last three years have earned their lofty valuations. At the same time, even legendary bull runs usually have a couple of sharp price corrections along the way. That's particularly true when the bulls are racing in the middle of a shaky global economy.

On that note, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is too narrowly focused for my taste in this economy. I mean, even the classic S&P 500 funds look too concentrated since 27.8% of their total value comes from the top five holdings (including semiconductor king Nvidia in the top spot, of course). The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes this focus one step further. It holds just 30 stocks, and the top five names add up to 33.6% of the portfolio's assets under management (AUM).

Again, I'm usually fine with sector-specific ETFs. This just doesn't look like a good time to load up on this richly valued ETF. The ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 37 with a meager 0.7% dividend yield and a lofty beta value of 1.6. In other words, it's both expensive and volatile.

SOXX,"S&P, Nasdaq Hit New Highs: Stock Market Today",,"A new infrastructure deal for a chipmaker and an acquisition between regional banks combined to boost markets Monday. The leader of the AI revolution was left out of the rally, though, and the naming of a new CEO invited fresh questions from investors about the future of the biggest U.S. telecommunications company by subscriber base.

Seven of the 11 official stock market sectors closed in the green, led by consumer discretionary and communication services stocks. Real estate and consumer staples stocks lagged during a broadly positive day for many but a particularly tough session for some names.

""October got off to a bullish start as traders looked past the government shutdown and the economic data vacuum it created,"" according to E*TRADE Managing Director Chris Larkin.

As Larkin notes, the earnings calendar won't fill up until next week, though ""traders may take their cues"" from companies such as Delta Air Lines (DAL, +1.8%) and PepsiCo (PEP, -1.6%), both of which report third-quarter results before Thursday's opening bell, as well as commentary from multiple Federal Reserve officials.

This week's economic calendar includes the release of the minutes from the September Fed meeting on Wednesday. Among other Fed speakers, we'll hear from recently confirmed Fed Governor Stephen Miran twice on Tuesday and Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday.

Meanwhile, a decision by the Supreme Court means Lisa Cook will stay on the Fed board at least until January.

""While October has been one of the stronger months for stocks over the past three decades,"" Larkin says, it's also remained one of the most volatile. Even when the market has ended up at a bullish destination, the ride has sometimes been bumpy.""

By Monday's closing bell, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had rallied off its intraday lows and/but ended the day down 0.1% to 46,694, ending a six-session winning streak.

The broad-based S&P 500 Index added 0.4% to 6,740, reaching another new all-time closing high in the process. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7% to 22,941, rising to its own fresh new high.

AMD stock gets a big OpenAI bounce

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, +23.7%) and ChatGPT operator OpenAI announced a deal to collaborate on the construction of AI data centers to be run on AMD chips, and AMD stock soared as much as 37.6% Monday.

Semiconductor stocks, as represented by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX, +3.0%), were broadly higher for the day.

""We are in a phase of the build-out where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. ""You'll see this on chips. You'll see this on data centers. You'll see this lower down the supply chain.""

Nvidia (NVDA, -1.1%) was down as much as 2.3%, its dominant position in the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout somewhat undermined by AMD's big announcement.

Verizon has a new CEO

Verizon Communications (VZ, -5.1%) was the biggest drag on the Dow after it said Daniel Schulman will replace Hans Vestberg as CEO effective immediately. The large-cap stock was down as much as 5.3% at its intraday low.

Schulman, currently an independent lead director for Verizon, is the former CEO of Paypal Holdings (PYPL, +3.0%). Vestberg will remain as a special adviser until October 4, 2026.

VZ stock is up 15% so far in 2025, but its longer-term trend isn't as encouraging. Indeed, Verizon has shed more than 30% over the last five years, as the telecom has struggled to stave off efforts by AT&T (T, -4.4%) and T-Mobile US (TMUS, -2.3%) to poach its home internet and mobile phone customers.

""Verizon is at a critical juncture,"" Schulman said in a statement. ""We have a clear opportunity to redefine our trajectory, by growing our market share across all segments of the market, while delivering meaningful growth in our key financial metrics.""

A regional bank gets bigger

Comerica (CMA, +13.7%) rose as much as 18% on news it will be acquired by fellow regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB, -1.4%) in a deal that will expand the footprint for one of the best bank stocks to buy.

The $10.9 billion all-stock transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2026. It would create the ninth-largest U.S. bank with approximately $288 billion in assets.

CMA shareholders will receive 1.87 FITB shares per each CMA share they own, representing $82.88 per share as of Fifth Third's closing price on Friday, October 3, and a 20% premium to CMA's 10-day volume-weighted average stock price. Management expects the deal to be immediately accretive to earnings per share.

CFRA Research analyst Alexander Yokum said the acquisition provides significant scale benefits and strengthens Fifth Third's commercial banking operations.

The analyst notes concerns about Comerica's ""operational challenges,"" including stagnant loan growth as well as elevated deposit costs, and geographic concentration in Michigan and California.

SOXX,The 3 AI ETF Plays That Could Outperform the Market in 5 Years,,"Key Points

The tech sector’s exposure to AI gives it plenty of potential to keep outperforming the S&P 500.

AI is driving increased demand for semiconductors, benefiting chip makers and equipment suppliers.

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is a good way to invest in AI companies outside the tech sector.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

There are plenty of ways to invest in artificial intelligence (AI).

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are designing cutting-edge AI chips.

Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are pushing the bounds of cloud computing.

Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel manufacture chips using equipment supplied by companies like ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam Research.

There's also the indirect method of investing in AI, which can be achieved through any company that utilizes it to enhance efficiency. For example, Walmart's AI-powered supply chain optimization.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with an AI bent offer a simple way to invest in a portfolio of companies rather than picking and choosing just a handful of names. Here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT), iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), and the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG) are AI ETFs that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the next five years.

1. Vanguard Information Technology ETF

This ETF mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Big gains from ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle have made the ETF heavily concentrated in just a handful of names.

Just 10 holdings make up 57.8% of the fund. However, many of those holdings have a ton of exposure to AI.

Not long ago, the tech sector was dominated by software names. However, big gains from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which are powering data centers with AI chips, have given the tech sector much more exposure to semiconductor, materials, and hardware. These industries, along with electronic equipment and components, now make up well more than half of the tech sector.

The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is one of the least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector, with an expense ratio of just 0.09%.

2. iShares Semiconductor ETF

If you like the technology sector's increasing reliance on semiconductor stocks, then you'll love this ETF. It's the ideal pick for folks who believe the semiconductor industry is one of the best ways to invest in AI.

The strategy has paid off, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF has achieved a staggering 184% total return over the last five years, which is better than the 151% total return for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and far better than the 151% total return for the S&P 500.

This fund has a higher expense ratio than the aforementioned Vanguard ETFs, at 0.34%. However, it's a great way to get exposure to semiconductor companies that have very low weightings in the S&P 500 (or aren't included at all).

Advanced Micro Devices has a 7.1% weighting in the fund, Qualcomm makes up 5.8%, and Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Intel, Lam Research, Marvell Technology, Applied Materials, KLA, ASML, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all more than 4%.

3. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF

This fund isn't limited to a single sector. Rather, it essentially filters the S&P 500 by doubling down on top growth stocks and leaving out value-focused companies.

This strategy has helped the fund slightly outperform the S&P 500 over the last five years. But it could easily beat the market over the next five years if mega-cap growth stocks continue leading the major indexes to new heights.

Around 55% of this ETF is invested in the Ten Titans, which have plenty of upside potential from AI. What's more, the ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.07%, or $7 for every $10,000 invested.

Add it all up, and it's a simple and low-cost way to get exposure to growth-focused S&P 500 companies.

Winning ETFs with room to run

The discussed ETFs are ideally suited for investors looking to build their AI exposure around today's leading companies. However, they may not be suitable for investors seeking to diversify into newer companies.

A common mistake is duplicating holdings across ETFs, which results in more exposure than an investor may realize. For example, if an investor owns Nvidia stock outright but also has $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, that's another $720 in Nvidia simply because it makes up 7.2% of the index.

However, it could also be a mistake to ignore today's leaders just because they are hiding in plain sight. Big tech firms are ramping up spending on AI, and a lot of that spending is funneling to the semiconductor industry and associated hardware and infrastructure companies. That gives Nvidia and Broadcom the green light to pour excess profits into research and development to expand their lead over the competition.

In this vein, doubling down on top tech stocks through low-cost ETFs may be one of the simplest ways to potentially beat the S&P 500 over the next five years.

This ETF mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Big gains from ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle have made the ETF heavily concentrated in just a handful of names.

Just 10 holdings make up 57.8% of the fund. However, many of those holdings have a ton of exposure to AI.

Not long ago, the tech sector was dominated by software names. However, big gains from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which are powering data centers with AI chips, have given the tech sector much more exposure to semiconductor, materials, and hardware. These industries, along with electronic equipment and components, now make up well more than half of the tech sector.

The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is one of the least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector, with an expense ratio of just 0.09%.

2. iShares Semiconductor ETF

If you like the technology sector's increasing reliance on semiconductor stocks, then you'll love this ETF. It's the ideal pick for folks who believe the semiconductor industry is one of the best ways to invest in AI.

The strategy has paid off, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF has achieved a staggering 184% total return over the last five years, which is better than the 151% total return for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and far better than the 151% total return for the S&P 500.

This fund has a higher expense ratio than the aforementioned Vanguard ETFs, at 0.34%. However, it's a great way to get exposure to semiconductor companies that have very low weightings in the S&P 500 (or aren't included at all).

Advanced Micro Devices has a 7.1% weighting in the fund, Qualcomm makes up 5.8%, and Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Intel, Lam Research, Marvell Technology, Applied Materials, KLA, ASML, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all more than 4%.

3. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF

This fund isn't limited to a single sector. Rather, it essentially filters the S&P 500 by doubling down on top growth stocks and leaving out value-focused companies.

This strategy has helped the fund slightly outperform the S&P 500 over the last five years. But it could easily beat the market over the next five years if mega-cap growth stocks continue leading the major indexes to new heights.

Around 55% of this ETF is invested in the Ten Titans, which have plenty of upside potential from AI. What's more, the ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.07%, or $7 for every $10,000 invested.

Add it all up, and it's a simple and low-cost way to get exposure to growth-focused S&P 500 companies.

Winning ETFs with room to run

The discussed ETFs are ideally suited for investors looking to build their AI exposure around today's leading companies. However, they may not be suitable for investors seeking to diversify into newer companies.

A common mistake is duplicating holdings across ETFs, which results in more exposure than an investor may realize. For example, if an investor owns Nvidia stock outright but also has $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, that's another $720 in Nvidia simply because it makes up 7.2% of the index.

However, it could also be a mistake to ignore today's leaders just because they are hiding in plain sight. Big tech firms are ramping up spending on AI, and a lot of that spending is funneling to the semiconductor industry and associated hardware and infrastructure companies. That gives Nvidia and Broadcom the green light to pour excess profits into research and development to expand their lead over the competition.

In this vein, doubling down on top tech stocks through low-cost ETFs may be one of the simplest ways to potentially beat the S&P 500 over the next five years.",The Motley Fool,2025-09-30T09:59:05Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/buy-ai-growth-stock-etf-outperform-sp-500/,0.4,2025-10-25 14:02:20.348857,,0.2313725490196079

SOXX,The AMD-OpenAI Mega Deal Ignites 77% Surge In This ETF - GraniteShares 2x Long AMD Daily ETF (NASDAQ:AMDL),,"GraniteShares 2x Long AMD Daily ETF (NASDAQ:AMDL) is attracting new investor interest as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) solidifies its place in the race for AI hardware with a blockbuster deal with OpenAI and potential foundry cooperation with Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC).

AMDL ETF is up almost 12% today. Track real-time prices here.

AMD’s new multi-year agreement with OpenAI can rake in more than $100 billion in revenue over the next four to six years, as the chipmaker is set to provide as much as six gigawatts of computing power utilizing its future-generation Instinct MI450X GPUs as early as late 2026, Bank of America Securities estimated.

The firm retained a Buy rating and increased its price target from $200 to $250, describing the deal as one of the most disruptive opportunities within the AI hardware space.

This has highlighted AMDL as a rare ETF providing investors with concentrated exposure to AMD’s growing AI ecosystem. The fund targets companies that are beneficiaries of AMD’s growth path in semiconductors, foundries, and computing infrastructure, qualifying as a pure-play proxy for AMD’s success in the next stage of the AI buildout.

At the time of publishing, AMDL is up around 77% since the announcement of the Open AI-AMD partnership on Monday.

AMD was already in the spotlight since Oct 1, as news emerged that Intel is in preliminary discussions to bring on AMD as a foundry customer, a milestone that would highlight the increasing interdependence among U.S. chipmakers as they compete to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturng Co Ltd (NYSE:TSM). For Intel, having AMD come aboard as a customer would legitimize its foundry comeback, and for AMD, having more diversified manufacturing partners would make its supply chain more robust as the demand picks up.

AMDL may prove to be a savvy thematic play on other semiconductor ETFs such as VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) or iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), which spread their exposure across multiple chipmakers. With AMD now being shoulder-to-shoulder with Nvidia and Broadcom in multi-billion-dollar AI infrastructure transactions, AMDL is a concentrated way to play that potential upside.

While the AI arms race is heating up, those betting on the next growth phase for AMD might find the AMDL ETF a smart way to tap into the chipmaker’s $100 billion supercycle, without committing all the way to one stock.

SOXX,Dividend Growth Continues as 3 Big Stocks Raise Payouts,,"Texas Instruments NASDAQ: TXN, T-Mobile US NASDAQ: TMUS, and Target NYSE: TGT are three big-name firms in the United States that are giving income investors something to cheer about. All three recently announced dividend increases, helping boost the yield shareholders can expect to receive.

Despite relatively small boosts from Texas Instruments and Target, these two stocks are still some of the highest-yielding in the market. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is lifting its moderately above-average yield in resounding fashion. Let's dive in below to see how much income these names can now offer investors.

TXN Boosts Dividend 4%, Maintains One of the Top Yields in Tech

First up is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, Texas Instruments. The firm is approximately the eighth-largest chip stock in the world, with a market capitalization of $168 billion. On Sept. 19, TXN announced a new $1.42 per share quarterly dividend, a 4% increase from its previous payout. The dividend will be payable on Nov. 12 to stockholders of record on Oct. 31.

Although the increase percentage is relatively small, Texas Instruments continues to hold one of the highest dividend yields in the tech sector. The firm’s indicated yield now moves to just under 3.1%. This gives the company the third-highest yield among large-cap U.S. tech stocks and the second-largest among U.S. large-cap chip stocks. Notably, Texas Instruments has now announced a dividend increase for 22 years in a row.

Despite being one of the largest and most recognizable semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments has greatly underperformed its industry over the past few years. The stock’s five-year total return of 54% falls way short of the 185% total return of the iShares Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SOXX.

T-Mobile Announces Big Dividend Increase Amid CEO Shift

Next up is Big Three telecom stock T-Mobile. On Sept. 18, the company announced a very substantial 16% increase to its quarterly dividend. The new $1.02 per share dividend is payable on Dec. 11 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on Nov. 26, 2025. This moves T-Mobile’s indicated dividend yield to a solid 1.7%, significantly exceeding the approximately 1.1% yield of the S&P 500 Index.

This dividend increase came just days before T-Mobile announced a change in the company’s top leadership position: Chief Executive Officer (CEO). On Nov. 1, Srini Gopalan will replace current CEO Mike Sievert. Sievert, who first became CEO in May 2020, oversaw an incredible rally in T-Mobile’s share price.

Overall, shares have provided a total return of more than 180% since Sievert took over, adding over $150 billion in market capitalization. T-Mobile says this makes Sievert “the most value-creating CEO in global telecom history,"" leaving Gopalan a massive pair of shoes to fill. The dividend increase provides a level of confidence that T-Mobile can continue performing well despite the shake-up.

Target: 5.2% Yielder Looks to Turn Performance Around With Fresh Blood in 2026

Lastly, consumer staples giant Target is also sweetening the pot for income investors. On Sept. 17, the $40 billion company declared a new quarterly dividend of $1.14. This is only a 1.8% increase over Target’s previous payment of $1.12 per share; however, the stock's yield is still eye-catching.

Now, Target’s indicated dividend yield stands at approximately 5.2%, clearly positioning it as a high-yield stock. Among U.S. large-cap consumer staples stocks, Target’s yield ranks in the top 10 highest. It is also in the top 25, highest of all stocks in the S&P 500 Index.

Target’s latest dividend comes after the company also recently appointed a new CEO. Michael Fiddelke will succeed Brian Cornell on Feb. 1, 2026. However, unlike T-Mobile, the change doesn’t come amid a fantastic showing from the company’s previous leader. Since Cornell became CEO on Aug. 12, 2014, Target has achieved a total return of just 109%. That comes in around 30% below the S&P 500 consumer staples sector, and several magnitudes below the overall index. Target is hoping that Fiddelke can turn the tide going forward.

Capital Returns Remain a Priority for These Stocks

Overall, these three stocks are showing their commitment to returning capital to shareholders, regardless of how well they are currently performing. T-Mobile’s increase stands out in particular, adding a lot of juice to its dividend. This is a good way to start off Gopalan’s tenure, signaling strength from the company despite shares returning less than 9% so far in 2025.

IWM,Dogecoin Awaits Risk-On Ignition As 2021 Pattern Repeats | dogecoin Doge,,"Dogecoin is back in a familiar posture on multiple timeframes, according to crypto analyst Osemka (@Osemka8), who argues that price action is tracking the “OTHERS” index almost one-for-one and is now deep inside a textbook Wyckoff accumulation. His latest charts—one a decade-long view, the other a daily structure map—frame the current chop as the classic test phase that tends to exhaust both sides before trend continuation.

Dogecoin’s Perfect Wyckoff Trap

On the long-horizon chart, Dogecoin’s history resolves into a sequence of rounded basing formations that preceded its two vertical advances. The first arc matured from 2014 into 2017 before the initial markup; the second spanned 2018 through 2020 and ended with the 2021 blow-off; and a third, broader arc has been curving under price action from 2022 into 2025.

While DOGE is currently trading below $0.20, the rounding contour is again still intact—visually rhyming with the two prior launch setups that culminated in rapid expansions once supply thinned out above range highs. The shorter-term daily chart annotates the Wyckoff schematic in granular detail. Osemka labels the Preliminary Support (PS) and Selling Climax (SC) earlier in the year, followed by an Automatic Rally (AR) and a Secondary Test (ST) to confirm the lower boundary of a gently rising channel.

A sharp downdraft into a “Spring”—accompanied by conspicuously high capitulation volume—punctured the channel intraday before snapping back, an action that often functions as the terminal shakeout of Phase C in the classical model.

Since then, price has coiled in what the chart calls the “Test phase,” compressing roughly between $0.18 and $0.22 as bids and offers probe for residual supply. Overhead, a shaded local supply zone sits in the $0.26 to $0.28 area and lines up with the upper half of the channel; the channel’s ceiling runs into the low-$0.30s (~$0.32), where initial supply repeatedly slows advances.

“DOGE coin follows OTHERS index almost 1:1. A perfect Wyckoff accumulation range. Test phase driving everyone nuts,” Osemka noted via X.

Macro Environment Still Not Ready Yet

The analyst’s market read ties the micro to the macro playbook he has tracked before. In an October 7 note, Osemka highlighted that DOGE is typically late to the risk rotation: breadth improves first, IWM (small caps: iShares Russell 2000 ETF) breaks out, alts begin to rise, and only when the OTHERS index clears its prior all-time high does Dogecoin tend to accelerate.

“Rounded bottom on DOGE each time. Since DOGE is that coin that does nothing the entire cycle then rips faces off, it’s interesting to compare what happens after macro environment switches to Risk-on mode. What I can get from this is nothing special. Once IWM breaks out, alts start to rise and DOGE still lags behind, but just a bit. Only once OTHERS breaks it’s ATH is when DOGE starts flying,” the analyst explained.

His most recent exchange with followers keeps that conditionality intact; he acknowledges that, by his OTHERS fractal, “one stab lower” remains possible before markup, especially with Bitcoin liquidity a few percent lower on his gauges. In Wyckoff terms, that would be a final test or spring-within-the-spring, designed to validate demand at or just under the $0.18–$0.22 coil before a Sign of Strength (SOS) can assert above $0.32.

Context across the memecoin complex is mixed. Osemka notes that PENGU has been outperforming DOGE on his relative charts “at the moment,” even as he lists TAO, DOGE, and ONDO as the “best-looking setups” for altcoins, with TAO “by far the strongest” and “other alts” screened as weak. The implication is rotation rather than dispersion: DOGE’s structure is constructive, but confirmation still hinges on a clean exit from the accumulation range and the broader risk-on ignition he maps via IWM and OTHERS.

For traders mapping levels off these panels, the near-term battlegrounds are explicit. The test box at $0.18–$0.22 has to hold its series of higher lows to keep Phase D in play; the local supply at $0.26–$0.28 is the first meaningful resistance shelf that must be absorbed; and the rising channel top near ~$0.32 is where bulls take control.

Only sustained acceptance above those bands would upgrade the structure from accumulation to markup, aligning DOGE with the 2017 and 2021 launch sequences that Osemka’s rounded-bottom study brings into focus. Until then, the “perfect Wyckoff trap” characterization remains apt: the range is doing what ranges do—testing patience and conviction—while the intermarket checklist that has historically preceded DOGE’s impulsive legs waits for its final tick.

At press time, DOGE traded at $0.194.

IWM,Dogecoin Awaits Risk-On Ignition As 2021 Pattern Repeats,,"Dogecoin is back in a familiar posture on multiple timeframes, according to crypto analyst Osemka (@Osemka8), who argues that price action is tracking the “OTHERS” index almost one-for-one and is now deep inside a textbook Wyckoff accumulation. His latest charts—one a decade-long view, the other a daily structure map—frame the current chop as the classic test phase that tends to exhaust both sides before trend continuation.

Dogecoin’s Perfect Wyckoff Trap

On the long-horizon chart, Dogecoin’s history resolves into a sequence of rounded basing formations that preceded its two vertical advances. The first arc matured from 2014 into 2017 before the initial markup; the second spanned 2018 through 2020 and ended with the 2021 blow-off; and a third, broader arc has been curving under price action from 2022 into 2025.

While DOGE is currently trading below $0.20, the rounding contour is again still intact—visually rhyming with the two prior launch setups that culminated in rapid expansions once supply thinned out above range highs.

The shorter-term daily chart annotates the Wyckoff schematic in granular detail. Osemka labels the Preliminary Support (PS) and Selling Climax (SC) earlier in the year, followed by an Automatic Rally (AR) and a Secondary Test (ST) to confirm the lower boundary of a gently rising channel.

A sharp downdraft into a “Spring”—accompanied by conspicuously high capitulation volume—punctured the channel intraday before snapping back, an action that often functions as the terminal shakeout of Phase C in the classical model.

Since then, price has coiled in what the chart calls the “Test phase,” compressing roughly between $0.18 and $0.22 as bids and offers probe for residual supply. Overhead, a shaded local supply zone sits in the $0.26 to $0.28 area and lines up with the upper half of the channel; the channel’s ceiling runs into the low-$0.30s (~$0.32), where initial supply repeatedly slows advances.

“DOGE coin follows OTHERS index almost 1:1. A perfect Wyckoff accumulation range. Test phase driving everyone nuts,” Osemka noted via X.

Macro Environment Still Not Ready Yet

The analyst’s market read ties the micro to the macro playbook he has tracked before. In an October 7 note, Osemka highlighted that DOGE is typically late to the risk rotation: breadth improves first, IWM (small caps: iShares Russell 2000 ETF) breaks out, alts begin to rise, and only when the OTHERS index clears its prior all-time high does Dogecoin tend to accelerate.

“Rounded bottom on DOGE each time. Since DOGE is that coin that does nothing the entire cycle then rips faces off, it’s interesting to compare what happens after macro environment switches to Risk-on mode. What I can get from this is nothing special. Once IWM breaks out, alts start to rise and DOGE still lags behind, but just a bit. Only once OTHERS breaks it’s ATH is when DOGE starts flying,” the analyst explained.

His most recent exchange with followers keeps that conditionality intact; he acknowledges that, by his OTHERS fractal, “one stab lower” remains possible before markup, especially with Bitcoin liquidity a few percent lower on his gauges. In Wyckoff terms, that would be a final test or spring-within-the-spring, designed to validate demand at or just under the $0.18–$0.22 coil before a Sign of Strength (SOS) can assert above $0.32.

Context across the memecoin complex is mixed. Osemka notes that PENGU has been outperforming DOGE on his relative charts “at the moment,” even as he lists TAO, DOGE, and ONDO as the “best-looking setups” for altcoins, with TAO “by far the strongest” and “other alts” screened as weak. The implication is rotation rather than dispersion: DOGE’s structure is constructive, but confirmation still hinges on a clean exit from the accumulation range and the broader risk-on ignition he maps via IWM and OTHERS.

For traders mapping levels off these panels, the near-term battlegrounds are explicit. The test box at $0.18–$0.22 has to hold its series of higher lows to keep Phase D in play; the local supply at $0.26–$0.28 is the first meaningful resistance shelf that must be absorbed; and the rising channel top near ~$0.32 is where bulls take control.

Only sustained acceptance above those bands would upgrade the structure from accumulation to markup, aligning DOGE with the 2017 and 2021 launch sequences that Osemka’s rounded-bottom study brings into focus. Until then, the “perfect Wyckoff trap” characterization remains apt: the range is doing what ranges do—testing patience and conviction—while the intermarket checklist that has historically preceded DOGE’s impulsive legs waits for its final tick.

At press time, DOGE traded at $0.194.

IWM,All-Time High Resistance Holds For S&P And Nasdaq,,"Upcoming ""Death Cross"" for Russell 2000 ($IWM)

There was some modest buying today from the open, but volume was light and markets are below trading range support established during the latter part of 2024. It's hard to see where the buyers are going to come from given the chaos of Trump. I should add, I listened to Josh Brown's The Compound podcast and he showed an interesting chart of market returns in April-May in the year following a strong return in markets; in essence, selling to pay capital gains tax. Given the precarious nature of markets, and the possibility for this seasonal factor to play out, it's likely we have a couple more months of downward action before value buyers return. If we look at individual markets, the Russell 2000 ($IWM) is looking like the first to signal a long term shift in favor of bears with an upcoming ""Death Cross"" between the 50-day MA and 200-day MA - perhaps completing before the end of the week. Technicals are net bearish and the volume trend has collapsed since the st...

""Dead Cat"" Bounce or Something Better?

It's still a little too early to say, but the bounce is in play and ""long"" is the place to be. There is a huge amount of overhead resistance and the risk:reward remains tight with moves back to Thursday's lows well within expectations. For the S&P, I would be looking for a rally back to test the 200-day MA, or a fast-falling 20-day MA, whichever is the lowest. Real supply won't kick in until 5,700 is tested, and maybe it will have the juice to get to 5,775 before volume selling makes its presence felt. As the index makes this move I expect to see a decent On-Balance-Volume 'buy' signal, alongside what will be a weak MACD 'buy'; other technicals are likely to remain bearish.",markets.fallondpicks.com,2025-10-22T21:26:28Z,https://www.markets.fallondpicks.com/2025/10/all-time-high-resistance-holds-for-s.html,1.0,2025-10-25 14:03:05.878396,,-0.05098039215686279
IWM,"A Decline in Gold Gives Other Stocks the Chance to Rally, But Is There a Change?",,"Quantum, Gold, Uranium, and Rare Earths, Oh My!
At some point, parabolas stop going up, and they come down. Often by a lot. The past few days have been a lesson in what happens when the air leaks out of a speculative bubble. And the lessons, I believe, will continue.
Folks are still asking where to buy gold. My answer is: it should not be WHERE but WHEN. I did not know in April when GLD had peaked that it would take nearly five months before the setup was right again. I did not know that the price would not be much different than where it was in April. What I did know, same as today, is that it had gone too far and speculation had run amok.
Will that blue line break? My guess is the chart folks will be quite excited to buy in that 365-370 area, as the line is there and 370 fills a gap. But for me, I would need a pattern to set up much the way it set up back in late August. In fact, in late August, no one was asking where/when to buy GLD because it had been dead money for so long, no one cared anymore. I suspect we will get to the point that I stop getting asked.
In the meantime, the down-and-outs got a chance to rally on Tuesday. We see it most acutely in the ratio of IWM to SML. We looked at this last week. As a reminder, IWM does not require companies to be profitable, while SML does. SML has been outperforming for the first time all month, and ex the blip in late September, this is really the first time since mid-August. So maybe we’re finally getting that group rotation into Quality over Garbage.
Turning to sentiment, I have been asked why I think the CNN Fear and Greed Indicator is showing FEAR when other indicators, such as the Citi Panic/Euphoria, are not. I can’t say why exactly because I do not know the inputs to the Citi Panic/Euphoria Model (it is proprietary). What I can tell you is that if we use one simple sentiment indicator, the 21-day moving average of the ISE call/put ratio, we see three peaks in the last year.
At one peak, in late December, the Fear and Greed was at point A on the chart. Stocks rallied and then collapsed about two months later. Notice that Fear and Greed never even got to 50 on that rally.
Then, in late July, Fear and Greed got to Extreme Greed at the same time that the ISE ratio also saw an extreme. The S&P did not correct at all. But you know what did? The majority if stocks—see the McClellan Summation Index and its downward slope since July.
So, do you believe we are in late December last year, or do you think this is more like April? Since there is no other sentiment indicator that is down hovering in Fear, I’ll point out that maybe it’s not worth fussing over the outlier.",TheStreet Pro,2025-10-22T10:00:00Z,https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/a-decline-in-gold-gives-other-stocks-the-chance-to-rally-but-is-there-a-change,1.0,2025-10-25 14:03:06.658318,,0.02745098039215677
IWM,"Indore News: City Cleans Up Over 1,400 Tonnes Of Waste Overnight After Diwali Celebration",,"Indore (Madhya Pradesh): Living up to its title as India’s cleanest city, Indore once again turned festive chaos into civic pride by cleaning up the entire city within hours after Diwali night.

While residents enjoyed fireworks and celebrations till midnight, the city’s sanitation force began its mission at 3 am -- ensuring by sunrise, Indore gleamed as if the night’s festivities had never happened.

More than 1,400 tonnes of waste, including firecracker remains, decorative materials and packaging litter, were collected and processed overnight. Teams from Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), Integrated Waste Management (IWM) and other allied units worked across all major zones in perfect coordination.

The operation began from crowded commercial areas and marketplaces, followed by residential colonies, mohallas and narrow lanes. A fleet of 23 mechanised cleaning machines, along with hundreds of safai mitras and IWM staff, were deployed on ground duty.

Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargav personally reviewed the post-Diwali operation and appreciated the tireless efforts of sanitation workers.

“Cleaning dustbins and roadside waste after large celebrations is a major challenge,” Bhargav said. “This year, special focus was given to these areas, and we ensured timely transfer of waste from Garbage Transfer Stations (GTS) to the processing sites,” he added.

In a strong show of leadership, municipal commissioner Dilip Kumar Yadav himself reached the field at 3 am to monitor the cleanliness drive. He inspected various areas, reviewed team deployment and motivated workers engaged in overnight cleaning. His on-ground supervision ensured that all arrangements worked seamlessly and waste was cleared in record time.

To maintain efficiency, IMC had kept its own tractors, dumpers, and sanitation vehicles ready across different locations. A time-bound waste transfer system was implemented from every GTS to the processing centres to prevent accumulation.

“During festivals like Diwali and Rang Panchami, waste generation multiplies. Yet Indore once again showed that cleanliness and celebration can go hand in hand,” said Bhargav.

By early morning, major roads, markets and colonies sparkled clean -- reaffirming why Indore consistently tops the Swachh Survekshan rankings. Residents woke up to spotless streets, unaware of the quiet efficiency and commitment displayed through the night by the city’s safai mitras, IWM teams, and civic officials.",Free Press Journal,2025-10-21T23:51:00Z,https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/indore-news-city-cleans-up-over-1400-tonnes-of-waste-overnight-after-diwali-celebration,1.0,2025-10-25 14:03:09.251049,,0.1607843137254903
IWM,"Dimon Sees 'Cockroaches' In Banks -- Here's How To Protect Your Portfolio - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA:IWM)",,"Fresh fears of mounting credit stress in the U.S. banking system have resurfaced after JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning that more financial trouble could be lurking below the surface.

""When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,"" Dimon said during last week's earnings call, referring to the recent bankruptcies of First Brands—an auto parts maker reportedly under criminal investigation—and Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender.

On Wednesday, just a day after Dimon’s warning, concerns deepened as Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) disclosed a $50 million charge-off tied to two troubled commercial loans from its California Bank & Trust unit.

A day later, Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) revealed it had filed a fraud lawsuit against a borrower, adding to the sector's unease.

Now, with regional banks and private equity showing signs of strain, Wall Street is bracing for what could be the next major shock to markets.

Why Treasury Bonds Could Make A Comeback As Liquidity Tightens

While many analysts believe these credit issues remain contained, the broader market may still be vulnerable—not because of credit exposure, but because of liquidity.

Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of America, says regulated banks today are better capitalized and less likely to spark a full-blown credit crisis.

However, she cautions that the S&P 500’s high concentration in a few large-cap tech names could make it more sensitive to liquidity shocks.

That's echoed by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. In a recent note, he warned that “Krunchy Kredit” cracks are spreading, pointing to weakness in the SPDR Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE), private credit, and the SPDR Insurance ETF (NYSE:KIE).

He added that if key financial benchmarks drop below critical levels, the Fed could be forced to cut more aggressively.

Hartnett is also turning bullish on bonds, suggesting that zero-coupon U.S. Treasuries could be the best hedge for credit event risk, with long-dated yields expected to fall below 4% amid Fed easing and global policy shifts away from quantitative tightening.

The PIMCO 25+ Year Zero Coupon US Treasury Index ETF (NYSE:ZROZ) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) are up 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively, thus far this month.

Analysts Also Flag Russell 2000 Puts

According to Jeff Jacobson, analyst at 22V Research, buying put options on small-cap stocks—tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM)—may be the best hedge if credit stress continues.

IWM has traditionally had a strong correlation with regional banks (KRE) and private credit, both of which are flashing warning signs.

Jacobson highlighted that while IWM outperformed both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) between August and mid-October, much of that gain was driven by capital goods, health care, software, tech, and utilities.

At the same time, unprofitable small caps have outperformed their profitable peers—possibly a sign of speculative AI-related flows entering riskier territory.

This divergence, he notes, could leave IWM vulnerable to a snapback if credit fears deepen and speculative excess unwinds.

Bottom Line: How to Protect Your Portfolio

As credit risks resurface—particularly in mid-sized banks and private credit markets—investors should stay on alert.

Key financial benchmarks like KRE ETF, the Financials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), and KIE ETF can offer early signals of deeper stress in the system, and watching their movements may help identify mounting pressure in the sector.

Long-duration Treasury bonds are increasingly viewed as potential hedges in the event of a broader liquidity stress, offering both safety and potential upside if yields fall further.

So far, the damage has been limited to a few lenders.

But if Dimon's ""cockroach"" metaphor proves accurate, the market may not be fully priced for what's still hiding in the shadows.

IWM,The Summer Small-Cap Stocks Turned Pretty,,"The rate-hike cycle to battle inflation was brutal for small-cap stocks in 2022. But it didn't get much better for the next two years. Though the Russell 2000 index climbed, its relative strength vs. the S&P 500 left a lot to be desired.

But that changed this summer.

Small-Cap Stocks Start To Outperform

After a number of false starts and trends that didn't last, we still looked at the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) with interest. Small-cap stocks have a history of outperforming the S&P 500 so we were looking for evidence that the underperformance drought was ending.

On Aug. 12, IWM finally broke out from its long cup-with-handle pattern (1). Not only did it break out, it outperformed strongly on the day. While the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were up 1.39% and 1.13%, respectively, the Russell 2000 and IWM shot up 2.97%.

We used a pullback a couple of days later as an entry on IBD's SwingTrader product (2) but then exited quickly after not getting any traction (3). But again, the small-cap stocks weren't forgotten. The next day saw support at the 21-day line and we used the upside reversal to get back into the IWM (4).

The persistence paid off. A couple days later saw a stunning 3.92% rise for the small-cap stocks ETF (5) giving us a chance to increase our weighting in the stock since we had a lower initial entry.

Trading Around A Core Position

When you have conviction in a position there are a couple of ways to give it preferential treatment. One is with a larger position size. The other is with an extended time horizon for the trade.

While SwingTrader does focus on short-term trades usually measured in days or weeks, a well-timed entry can extend that time frame up to a few months. But sticking with a larger position size over time can be more difficult. Even mild pullbacks hit hard when the size is larger. Trading around a core position can help reduce the drawdowns by scaling back either into strength or the first whiff of weakness.

A test of the 10-day line average along the way (6) led to some quick selling but then as the small-cap stocks ETF righted itself, we added the position back (7).

Some sells on weakness can be frustrating. Especially if there is an upside reversal on the day after shares are sold (8). It's worth remembering that the sell often has the goal to reduce drawdowns. You're protecting yourself from the cases when things get worse and sacrificing some gains for when the upside reversals come.

Is The Move In Small-Cap Stocks Over?

The weakness of last Friday put us all in cash and that included our IWM position (9). While our expectation following such moves is for sideways action as a base case, we have to be prepared to be wrong.

That's why we reentered the small-cap ETF when it showed a sharp rebound (10). The relative strength was remarkable as IWM cleared last Friday's high where most other indexes were still trading between the highs and lows of last Friday.

But the power didn't last. As IWM took a hit on Thursday (11), we exited the position. While we're open to being wrong on our assessment of choppiness on a short-term basis, we don't want to fight that instinct when the market proves us right.

Is This Congress Member Day Trading? - Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA:IWM)",,"The trading activity of members of Congress has come under increased pressure from the public in recent years. Members of Congress are currently free to buy and sell stocks and options, even buying options that expire in less than a week, as one member recently disclosed.

Congressman Discloses Options Purchases

While some members of Congress engage in questionable trades that could be considered conflicts of interest due to their committee assignments, other recent disclosures have revealed that members are violating the Stock Act by reporting transactions late.

While recent disclosures from Rep. Robert Bresnahan (R-Pa.) don't violate the Stock Act, they may raise red flags for investors as they suggest potential day trading.

Bresnahan recently disclosed several options purchases in ETFs that track three of the biggest market indexes. Here are the purchases, which were reported on the Benzinga Government Trades Page:

Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ): Bought options with strike price of $450 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 16 and was valued at $1,000 to $15,000.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY): Bought options with strike price of $470 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 16 and was valued at $15,000 to $50,000.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust: Bought options with strike price of $470 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 15 and was valued at $15,000 to $50,000.

iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM): Bought options with strike price of $175 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 15 and was valued at $1,000 to $515,000

iShares Russell 2000 ETF: Bought options with strike price of $175 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 15 and was valued at $1,000 to $15,000.

Invesco QQQ Trust: Bought options with strike price of $450 and expiration date of Sept. 19, 2025. The purchase was made on Sept. 15 and was valued at $1,000 to $15,000.

Each of the options purchased came with an expiration date three or four days away, making these short-term bets on market indexes such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000. Based on the short-term style of the trades, this indicates that Bresnahan's portfolio is following activity similar to that of a day trader or swing trader, which may be uncommon for a member of Congress.

In the notes of the disclosure, Bresnahan offers an explanation stating that it is not he who is making the trades.

""All investment decisions related to my personal financial portfolio are delegated to professional financial advisors. I have no role in, nor am informed of, specific investment decision prior to their execution,” the disclosure reads. “Accordingly, this transaction was planned and executed by a financial advisor.""

Based on that explanation, it is Bresnahan's financial advisor doing the day trading for him.

How Bresnahan's Options Have Performed

While it is unknown how many options in each ETF were purchased or at what price, investors can see where the ETFs traded each day and on the day of expiration.

Here are the closing prices on the day of purchase and on the day of expiration:

QQQ: Sept. 16 close $591.18, Sept. 19 close: $599.35

SPY: Sept. 16 close: $660.00, Sept. 19 close $663.70

SPY: Sept. 15 close: $660.81, Sept. 19 close: $663.70

IWM: Sept. 15 close: $239.35, Sept. 19 close $242.98

QQQ: Sept. 15 close: $591.68, Sept. 19 close: $599.35

Each of the options trades likely ended up in the money and could have been sold for a higher price or exercised into common shares based on the prices above.

Bresnahan's investing portfolio likely gained in value from these short-term options bets on major stock indexes made by the Congressman's financial advisor.

IWM,Representative Robert Bresnahan Reports Large Call Option Purchases in Major Market ETFs,,"By: Matthew Kerr, Quiver Data Analyst

Posted: 1 week, 2 days ago / Oct. 15, 2025 2:17 p.m. UTC

Representative Robert Bresnahan, who represents Pennsylvania’s 8th District, disclosed substantial options trades this week, revealing purchases in major market-tracking exchange-traded funds. The filing shows Bresnahan executed up to $175,000 worth of call option trades in the $QQQ, $SPY, and $IWM ETFs. Bresnahan stated that all trades were made by financial advisors acting on his behalf.

The disclosure covers transactions totaling as much as $175,000 across three ETFs representing the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Russell 2000 indices.

Call options give the holder the right to buy shares at a set price before expiration, typically used to express a bullish outlook on future market performance.

Bresnahan has now disclosed over $7 million in stock trades this year. These trades are reported under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act requirements.

Quantum Leaps & Rare Earth Rallies: Decoding the ""Post-Plunge"" Market

After a Friday plunge, stocks rebounded strongly on Monday. Below are five newsworthy market areas to monitor:

Small Caps Outperform

Small caps and theRussell 2000 Index (IWM) were the strongest stocks during Monday’s rebound. IWM gained 2.78% for the session, nearly clawing back all of Friday’s 2.99% loss. We remain constructive on the space as IWM works on a multi-year breakout.

Crypto Crashes Amid Overleverage, Rebounds Monday

The crypto market experienced its worst single-session market cap drop on Friday. Unfortunately, when President Trump shared his China message, many crypto investors were overleveraged and caught offside, causing a classic liquidation cascade in crypto and crypto proxies like the iShares Bitcoin ETF.

MP Materials Soars on Rare-Earth Tensions

MP Materials has emerged as a big winner and a hedge of sorts for investors amid the China-US rivalry backdrop. Shares have broken out and are up over 30% this month amid the news about China’s rare-earth restrictions. Because the US government views rare earths as a national security pillar, MP is likely to continue to be a beneficiary as the US decouples from China and other hostile countries. Meanwhile, respected JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently spoke about the need for the US to reduce reliance on foreign nations for rare earths and minerals.

AI Energy Stocks Soar Amid Flurry of Positive News

The artificial intelligence race between China and the United States is in full swing. While the US is off to an early (albeit, small) lead in the AI race, it is far behind in the energy race. Energy is critical to AI because AI data centers require significant energy. Monday, Bloom Energy spiked 26% after it announced a partnership to provide Brookfield with $5 billion in on-site fuel cells to power AI data centers. Meanwhile, Navitas Semiconductor, bolted 30% after the market close, following an announcement of a deal to help Nvidia power the next wave of AI factories. NVTS makes chips that help to make AI data centers more efficient.

Quantum Computing Stocks Continue to Soar

Despite Friday’s plunge, investors continued to pile into high-octane quantum computing stocks. QC stocks are the top 2025 performers. Rigetti Computing has rewarded shareholders with an astonishing 6,000% return thus far in 2025.

Bottom Line

Despite the Friday sell-off, Wall Street’s strongest industry themes reasserted themselves Monday. Quantum computing, rare earth, and AI energy stocks led the way.

IWM,"Money Flows From the Unprofitable to the Profitable, but Is a Correction Near?",,"That was quite a rollercoaster in the speculative names on Wednesday, wasn’t it? Those stocks garnered an awful lot of volume, too. Was it enough to say there was a panic? In some stocks, it probably was.
It’s tough to say when the fever breaks, as it finally did this week, if that’s it and we’ll never see these stocks rally again, but since my view remains the same, I like to wait for a pattern to set up again. While GLD did in fact bounce right off that line I drew in, and probably can/will bounce some more, I still have no interest in it because I want that pattern to set up.
But Wednesday brought us some other interesting tidbits, and I am not talking about the nonsense that went on in stocks like Beyond Meat (BYND) that traded well over two billion shares, having ramped up from fifty cents earlier in the week to 7.50 Wednesday morning and then closing at 3.50.
I am talking about the continued decline on the ratio of IWM to SML. Call it what you want, I call it the reversal of the unprofitable to the profitable.
I am talking about the fact that for the first time in ages, the advance/decline line on the NYSE held up rather well compared to the S&P. I am talking about the fact that the number of stocks making new lows did not expand. Last Thursday’s 42-point decline in the S&P brought us 60 stocks making new lows, and Wednesday’s brought us 18.
Of course, the number of stocks making new highs is not expanding, but again, that is the constant group rotation. Now the rotating is out of the low-quality stocks and into some energy and staples. I still think the market should try and rally again this week to get us back to a short-term overbought reading.
I want to end with a chart from Bespoke. For months, I have been saying that my indicators don’t change. The short term gets overbought and oversold (barely), but the intermediate term indicators tend to just sit there.
Bespoke tracks the number of consecutive days that the percentage of stocks trading over their 200-day moving average lines has been between 50% and 70%. This is not an indicator I use, but basically, call that neutral territory: not overbought/not oversold.
They highlighted that this is the longest streak (85 days) since we saw 116 days in August of 2018, and prior to that, January of 1994 with 166 days. I immediately recognized those dates because in both cases the market fell quite a bit within a few weeks.
I grant you, this is only two other instances, and we’re not yet at the extremes we saw in those instances. But this is what my indicators have said: no change. Yet when the streak is this long and they do change, it has tended to mean—at least these two times—a correction is near.
Just something to tuck away for when this does change.
Here’s the Bespoke chart.
Here is what 1994 and 2018 looked like. I would highlight one major difference between those two years and now: interest rates. In both cases, the Fed was either hiking or leaning toward it. They are not doing so now.",TheStreet Pro,2025-10-23T10:00:00Z,https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/money-flows-from-the-unprofitable-to-the-profitable-but-is-a-correction-near,0.8999999999999999,2025-10-25 14:02:48.357459,,0.04313725490196085
IWM,"Dow, Nasdaq 100 Futures Diverge As Traders Digest Earnings  --  Strategist Flags Risk Of First Correction Since April But Advises Seizing 'Buying Opportunities'",,"Earnings from IBM (IBM) and Tesla (TSLA) have largely disappointed investors.

Fed Governor Michael Barr is due to make a public appearance at 10:25 a.m. ET.

Morgan Stanley Chief Equity Strategist Mike Wilson sees a bit of frothiness in equity markets at the moment.

U.S. stocks are heading for a mixed start on Thursday after the major indices settled the previous session firmly in the red. Barring a couple of catalysts on the economic front, the market is left to the mercy of the ongoing earnings news flow as it struggles to take its next step amid the geopolitical challenges.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

IBM (IBM) and Tesla (TSLA), two key earnings the market looked forward to, disappointed investors. European chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM) lowered its annual forecast, blaming the predicament on a softer auto and industrial machinery end-market backdrop.

Energy stocks could be in the spotlight on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump announced sanctions against Russian oil giants. After Wednesday’s 1.2% rally, the WTI-grade light-sweet crude rose about 3.75% early Thursday, topping the $60 mark for the first time in about two weeks.

How Futures Are Trading

As of 3:10 a.m. ET on Thursday, the Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.26% and the S&P 500 futures added 0.17%, while the Russell 2000 futures jumped 0.56%. On the other hand, the Dow futures slipped 0.05%.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment toward the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, ticked up slightly and yet was ‘bearish’ heading into Thursday’s session. Retail, however, continued to hold an ‘extremely bearish’ view on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. The message volume on both streams remained ‘high.’

How Markets Traded On Wednesday

Stocks put up a lackadaisical performance on Wednesday as traders reacted to mixed earnings reports, the U.S.-China trade tensions, and the continuing government shutdown. Consumer discretionary, industrial, IT, and communication stocks fell sharply, while energy stocks saw noteworthy buying.

The QQQ and SPY ETFs declined 0.96% and 0.52%, respectively. ETF ended flat. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) slumped 1.48%, reflecting the weakness in the small-cap space, while the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) pulled back by 0.73% as the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated from a record.

Morgan Stanley Chief Equity Strategist Mike Wilson sees a bit of frothiness in the equity markets at the moment. Therefore, a 10%-15% correction in the S&P 500 is not only possible but would be normal at this stage of a new bull market, he said. The strategist highlighted the escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, increased stress in funding markets, and the rolling over of Morgan Stanley’s earnings revision breadth metric after its historic rise since April.

“Bottom line, I believe a new bull market began in April with a new rolling economic and earnings recovery that is now quite nascent,” he said, adding that “even new bull markets have corrections along the way, and that certain conditions argue we are at risk for the first tradable one since April.”

“Keep your powder dry in the near term for what should be a great buying opportunity, if it arrives,” he added.

Key Catalysts To Watch Out For

Among the key earnings due for the day are American Airlines (AAL), Alaska Air (ALK), AutoNation (AN), Dow (DOW), Hasbro (HAS), Honeywell (HON), Imax (IMAX), T-Mobile US (TMUS), Union Pacific (UNP), Baker Hughes (BKR), Ford Motor (F), Sallie Mae (SLM), VeriSign (VRSN) and Western Union (WU).

The National Association of Realtors’ existing home sales report for September is due at 10 a.m. ET, with the headline number expected to come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units compared to 4 million units in August.

Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr is due to make a public appearance at 10:25 a.m. ET.

How Other Markets Fared

Gold futures moved higher early Thursday, although trading notably below the all-time high of $4,398 seen last Friday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield continued to languish below the 4% level. The U.S. dollar has firmed against most of its counterparts.

Traders await another batch of earnings, including from market heavyweight Tesla (TSLA).

The economic calendar remains thin amid the government shutdown.

The major stock futures point to a higher opening after Tuesday’s mixed performance, as the U.S.-China trade tensions and the government shutdown continue to simmer on. The positive signal has come despite adverse reactions to earnings reports from Netflix (NFLX) and Texas Instruments (TXN).

Traders also await another earnings deluge, including from market heavyweight Tesla (TSLA), while the economic calendar remains thin amid the government shutdown.

How Futures Are Trading

As of 2:50 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 futures were all modestly higher. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment toward the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, remained ‘extremely bearish’ heading into Wednesday’s session. Retail also held an ‘extremely bearish’ view on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. The message volume on both streams remained ‘high.’

How Market Traded Tuesday

Strong earnings from legacy blue-chip stocks such as Coca-Cola (KO) and 3M Co. (MMM) helped mitigate the weakness seen among communication services, utility and material names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a fresh record just below the 47,000 psychological barrier, although it did breach the mark intraday, and the S&P 500 Index ended flat with a positive bias. On the other hand, the Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000 indices settled lower.

The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) rose 0.47%, while the SPY ETF ended flat. The QQQ ETF and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) fell 0.03% and 0.47%, respectively. Fund manager Louis Navellier shrugged off Tuesday’s decline as a digestive move after Monday’s substantial gains. Pointing to earnings reports from GE Aerospace (GE), Coca-Cola and General Motors (GM), he noted that earnings continue to come in strong.

Key Catalysts To Watch Out For

While focusing on the stock reaction to earnings released after the market close on Tuesday, traders will also sift through the quarterly reports from AT&T (T), GE Vernova (GEV) and Northern Trust (NTRS), all due before the market open.

Aside from Tesla, the other prominent names reporting after Wednesday’s close are Alcoa (AA), IBM (IBM), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and O’Reilly Auto (ORLY).

On the economic front, Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr is scheduled to speak at 4 p.m. ET.

How Other Markets Fared

Crude oil continued to be on the path to recovery and rose nearly 2% early Wednesday. Gold futures recovered from Tuesday’s almost 6% slump. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up early Wednesday after remaining at a sub-4% mark in the previous two sessions. The U.S. dollar traded nearly flat against most major currencies.

About 12% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their earnings so far, and 86% of these companies have reported earnings upside and 86% reported topline outperformance, according to FactSet’s Earnings Insight report. The blended earnings per share growth for S&P 500 companies is expected at 8.5% for the third quarter, and if the actuals align with expectations, corporate earnings would have grown for nine straight quarters.

The imminent release of key tech earnings over the next couple of weeks could prompt traders to take a defensive stance.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

Fund manager Louis Navellier flagged the shutdown and the China trade uncertainty as the two major issues weighing down on the market. Credit concerns have also emerged as another significant headwind following disclosures from a few banks on Thursday.

As of 1 a.m. ET on Friday, the Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.51% and the S&P 500 futures fell about 0.48%, and the Russell 2000 futures moved down a steeper 0.64%, while the Dow futures slipped a more modest 0.33%.

The major averages fell moderately on Thursday amid a lack of any significant economic cues. Financials served as a big drag on the market after Zions Bancorp, a regional bank, disclosed a $50 million charge related to two commercial and industrial loans advanced by its California office, and its peer Western Alliance said it has sued Cantor for alleged fraud.

Except for IT stocks, every other sector came under selling pressure amid the ongoing uncertainties.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.68% and 0.37%, respectively, and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) ended down 0.68% The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) slumped 2.11%, as small-caps, which have seen a nice run-up on rate cut hopes, experienced profit-taking amid signals of banking risks.

Among the key earnings reports for the day are American Express (AXP), Comerica (CMA), Fifth Third (FITB), Regions Financial (RF), State Street (STT), Truist (TFC), Huntington Banc (HBAN), SLB (SLB), and Autoliv (ALV).

Navellier said growth and momentum names led from the front amid the market volatility, with the fund manager confident of the trend remaining positive. He views the Federal Reserve’s rate cut and the end of the shutdown as near-term catalysts that can help the market take its next leg up.

After ending Thursday’s session marginally higher, crude oil futures were marginally lower in the Asian session. The gold rally, which saw a let-up on Thursday, has resumed. On Thursday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield broke below the 4% mark for the first time since early April and has fallen further early Friday. Falling bond yields reflect expectations that the central bank will lower rates. The U.S. dollar has weakened for a fourth straight session.

IWM,"Nasdaq Futures Climb, Buoyed By Positive Tech Tidings -- But Macro, Geopolitical Concerns Temper Optimism",,"Early indications suggest a firmer, although cautious, start by Wall Street stocks as traders continue to contend with the uncertainties about the government reopening after the 16-day shutdown. The absence of any major government data due to the ongoing shutdown has also rendered the mood cautious.

That said, earnings have provided an offsetting impact, with TSMC’s (TSM) stellar quarterly results confirming the strength relayed by Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML) on Wednesday. Transportation company JB Hunt’s (JBHT) strong third-quarter revenue augurs well for earnings from the industry.

As of 3:40 a.m. ET on Thursday, the Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 31% and the S&P 500 futures added 0.13%, while the Dow and Russell 2000 futures rose marginally.

On Wednesday, the major averages closed mostly higher amid volatility, although the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated modestly, with positive big bank earnings helping to assuage macro concerns.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 Index, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) climbed 0.44% and 0.46%, respectively. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) gained 0.98%, while the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) ended flat.

The economic calendar for the day is literally empty, while on the earnings front, Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and KeyCorp. (KEY), Commercial Metals (CMC), M&T Bank (MTB), Marsh McLennan (MMC), Travelers (TRV), U.S. Bancorp. (USB), CSX (CSX) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) are due to release their quarterly results.

Crude oil futures extended their rally, rising nearly 1% early Thursday, and gold’s record rally continues. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield slipped closer to the 4% mark.

IWM,The Short Story on Index Inclusion,,"We’ve talked in the past about how the mechanics of short selling work, and how the rules around trading, holding, and reporting do, too. However, there remain a lot of misconceptions out there about why companies see fluctuations in their short interest.

Now, we’ll talk about the interesting dynamics in today’s markets between short interest and index inclusion.

At first, these two seem unrelated — one about passive flows and benchmarking, and the other with market efficiency — but when you look at the data, some patterns emerge.

Index membership brings new passive demand – and new hedging activity

It’s no secret that addition to an index is good for companies; it means index funds will buy and hold your stock longer term and active funds need to decide if they want to stay underweight your stock.

It also results in inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and, sometimes, futures, which introduces the need for arbitrageurs to keep prices efficient. As today's data shows, hedging is one reason why shorting often goes up after being added to an index: Market makers need to hedge, for instance, long positions in futures, ETFs or index options.

For example, when an ETF like IWM (which tracks the Russell 2000) trades below its net asset value (NAV), authorized participants buy the (cheap) ETF and short the index constituents.

Over time, they may decide to redeem the long ETF for the underlying basket. Importantly, when they do that ETF redemption, the short position would also be reduced.

Hedge funds are net long

There are other hedges that also add to short positions, including:

Convertible arbitrage: Hedge funds will hedge away equity exposure, or exploit pricing inefficiencies, by buying convertible bonds and shorting the underlying stock.

Options related Hedges: Options market makers need to hedge exposure to their options trades by having long or short positions in underlying stocks and indexes.

Statistical Arbitrage activities: Funds may see mathematical deviations within a sector, where the relative values of securities against each other are unusually wide – sometimes caused by natural investors’ market impact on a specific stock they are buying. By buying the “cheaper” stock and shorting the “richer” stock(s) until the deviation returns to normal, they provide liquidity into both stock(s).

Importantly, research shows that hedge funds are net long. In fact, they had a net long position of $1.6 trillion (as of February 2024), with $1 trillion short in total, and only 1.3% ($48.5 billion) of total assets represented by dedicated short funds.

Short interest rises right after index inclusion

Our past work has shown that larger stocks tend to have higher short interest. Larger stocks are also more likely to be included in major indexes. Chart 1 shows this relationship by comparing short interest, market capitalization, and index inclusion.

Chart 1: Short interest is higher in S&P, Russell stocks

The takeaway is clear: While smaller-cap stocks that don’t qualify for index inclusion (grey dots on the left) have a wider spread in their short interest, there appears to be a “floor” of 1% short interest for stocks included in the Russell 3000 and S&P 500.

This is a direct result of the exact reasons listed above- these mechanical factors related to index membership create a baseline level of short interest that has nothing to do with market sentiment.

Even stocks with higher market caps that aren’t included in an index (the grey dots to the right) have lower short interest than those with a similar market cap that are included in an index.

Today, we are looking more closely at what happens to companies' short interest when they are added to the index.

As the data in Chart 2 shows, for the majority of stocks, short interest:

Increases for index addition stocks.

Decreases for index deletions.

Chart 2: Short interest rises in Russell 2000 additions, falls in removals

In fact, looking at the vertical axis above, we see short interest in the companies added to the index, on average, more than doubled, while the average decrease in removals was around 50%. For both, a ratio of 2:1.

By showing the details from the boxplot, we see that the majority of tickers also saw these changes (50% of the universe is in the colored boxes; only 5% are outside the tips of the lines). In fact, right after the 2025 Russell reconstitution:

99% of the Russell additions saw a short interest increase.

97% of the removals experienced a short interest decrease.

While only 58% of the companies that remained in the Russell had an increase.

Short interest isn’t always bearish

Index inclusion introduces new buyers to a company – new long-term (index) holders of your stock and more active investors who need to look at buying shares so that they are not underweight. They, in turn, add to liquidity, which should reduce the costs of trading.

But index inclusion also comes with more professional traders interested in hedging.

Interestingly, a recent paper found that index holders are also a key piece of this hedging story as they are more able to lend long-term positions to hedgers. That makes hedging the market cheaper and more efficient, while adding positive returns to the index fund.

The data we see today clearly tells a story. When a stock is added to an index, like the Russell 2000, short interest almost always rises — even though the fundamentals of the company haven’t changed.

One thing this also shows: Higher short interest isn’t always bearish.

IWM,Trades Relunctant To Punch New Highs For Indices; Take Profits,,"The Russell 2000 ($IWM) had done well to reverse its first big red candlestick in months on a solid day of ""value"" buying, but struggled to build on it. Now, with bad news sweeping the regional banking sector - leading to another sizable red (selling) candlestick on confirmed distribution - it's hard to see buyers coming in for a second bite. In percentage terms, markets are trading above summer levels, so there isn't too much downside to take what you can now (across all asset classes), and wait it out (until the next dip below 200-day MAs).

When we look at other indices, the picture looks more menancing. The S&P found resistance in what could turn out to be a reversal head-and-shoulder pattern as it reversed at September's swing high. We are seeing a degredation in the technical picture, albeit from a once strong bullish setup; for example, On-Balance-Volume is still trending higher, but is unlikely to survive a spate of distribution days. The 50-day MA is looking like a last chance saloon before we next stare at the 200-day MA far below.

The Nasdaq has rallied at a more modest rate than the S&P, so while it has a bearish setup similar to the S&P, it has more support to work with, and the 200-day MA isn't as far away in relative terms. It's on the verge of a 'sell' trigger in On-Balance-Volume, likely to occur today based on Futures action. I would still take profits, but whatever comes next may not be as damaging as some of the negative news around AI investment suggests will happen.

What may be more interesting is what's happening with Bitcoin. The selling its suffering, albeit on light volume, has it very much aligned as a ""tech"" index, rather than an alternative safehaven to gold. It will be interesting to see how much 'tech bros' will be willing to defend this (by buying the dip), or will they let it revert to its prior wild mood swings.

Going forward, it's going to get messy. Any expansion of this sell off will first ask the question, ""is this a new trading range?"", depending on where the initial downleg settles. Next will come a study on the veracity of the bounce, and where it may stall out. Then, off the stalled bounce, will that reversal kick start a new downwards trend. As for action, I have sold some covered calls in my ROTH, but holding my pension position. You don't want to trade (if able to) your pension account. Lighten up on the non-pension investment account so you can be a buyer on the next undercut of the 200-day MA.; April 2025 was the last such signal, so don't expect the next one to happen until sometime in 2026.

IWM,Bitcoin Finds Support At 200-day MA As Shorts Need To Cover,,"Bulls are doing a little better than I expected with the best of the action coming from Bitcoin. The false breakout at the beginning of October delivered the reversal back to former trading range support, as is often the case in such scenarios, before the spiked low and rally off converged 200-day MA and trading range support. Technicals are strongly net bearish, so this bounce will need to do more if it's to fix the weak technical picture.

Also, doing bettter than execpted are the indices. I was not expecting the S&P nor the Nasdaq to challenge - what had looked to be - a perfect short play. It's decision time for both indices, although the S&P now finds itself at another converged resistance point. If it's able to rally from here it will manage a new all-time high. I still think taking profits is a good thing, becuase the push higher is not backed by strong buying volume.

The Nasdaq finished just below all-time high resistance. There is an attempt by ADX to switch back to a 'bull' signal, but it has been driven by weakness in -DI rather than strength in the +DI. If the Nasdaq is able to clear 23K it will need to do so on higher volume.

While the Russell 2000 ($IWM) improved, it wasn't enough to suggest new all-time highs are imminent.

Traders who should be worrying more here are shorts. Up until today, the short trade was looking like a decent risk:reward, but now, those shorts need to look to cover - if they haven't already.

IWM,How cities in MP handled firecracker waste post diwali?,,"The gun powder and chemicals emitted from firecrackers and fireworks do not just disappear into the thin air; when it burns and comes in contact with oxygen, it causes a chemical reaction called combustion, and this chemical reaction has two results: first, you get short-lived entertainment, and second, the atmosphere gets toxic pollutants.

This short-lived visual pleasure and entertainment of yours not only contributes to climate change by increasing the amount of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter in the air, but the perchlorate emitted from it also contaminates soil and water.

Bhopal and Indore Step Up Post-Diwali Waste Management Efforts

Bhopal and Indore’s municipal authorities launched intensive post-Diwali sanitation drives to manage the surge in waste generated after the festival of lights. Both cities reported unusually high volumes of garbage this year, with civic teams working through the night to restore cleanliness and safety across public spaces.

Bhopal

The Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) collected over 1,100 tonnes of waste, nearly 300 tonnes more than the daily average. Of this, around 20 tonnes of firecracker residue—including gunpowder, ash, plastic wrappers, cardboard, and packaging—was handled separately as hazardous material. According to BMC Commissioner Sanskriti Jain, recyclable components such as cardboard and plastic, estimated at 5 tonnes, were sent to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) for processing. The remaining 15 tonnes of explosive waste have been secured at city garbage transfer stations for scientific disposal.

To manage the increased load, BMC conducted additional garbage collection rounds immediately after Diwali, deploying backup vehicles in areas facing technical issues. The operations were monitored in real time through the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) under the Smart City Project. Jain added that similar waste management protocols will be followed during the upcoming Ekadashi festival to ensure public safety.

Indore

Meanwhile, in Indore, the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) once again demonstrated its reputation for cleanliness. Following a night of festive celebrations, residents woke up on Tuesday to spotless streets and markets. The IMC’s massive post-Diwali clean-up began at 3 a.m. and wrapped up by 6 a.m., during which 6,000 workers collected and processed over 1,400 tonnes of waste within just a few hours.

The coordinated operation involved all NGOs partnered with IMC, with teams beginning from high-footfall zones such as major markets and squares before moving into residential colonies and inner lanes. Water tankers and drivers were deployed across all zones to assist with road washing and dust suppression.

A crucial role was played by the Integrated Waste Management (IWM) team, whose 23 mechanised sweeping machines operated overnight to clear debris from roads and public spaces. To mitigate risks, the waste collected—especially containing traces of cracker residue—will be soaked with water for the next two days.

“This approach allows any remaining explosive material to settle, minimising the risk of accidents during disposal,” said Rohit Sisonia, IMC’s Additional Commissioner.

Same efforts not seen in smaller municipalities

While Indore has been celebrated for its exceptional waste management, a stark contrast emerges in nearby Sehore city. Despite claims of systematic waste disposal, our investigation revealed a different reality at the local landfill site the day after Diwali.

The problem extended beyond Sehore city. In the surrounding municipal bodies of Ashta and Ichchhawar and various Gram panchayats, no efforts were made to handle firecracker waste responsibly. Roadside areas and landfill sites bore witness to the indiscriminate mixing of hazardous firecracker waste with general municipal waste.

The disconnect highlights a critical gap in waste management strategies. Despite progressive initiatives and claims of systematic waste disposal, the ground reality in many smaller municipalities remains far from the ideal. The haphazard disposal of potentially dangerous fireworks waste not only poses environmental risks but also undermines the broader goals of sustainable urban waste management.

What makes firecracker waste hazardous?

The classification of firecracker waste as hazardous is based on established regulatory guidelines. Waste is considered hazardous when it potentially threatens human health or the environment due to its physical, chemical, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive, or corrosive characteristics. Fireworks, with their complex chemical composition and explosive properties, fall squarely within this definition, necessitating specialised disposal methods.

Madhya Pradesh has addressed this challenge through dedicated infrastructure. The Common Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) in Pithampur Industrial Area, operational since November 2006, serves as the primary disposal site for the state’s hazardous waste. This facility ensures that potentially dangerous materials are handled with the utmost care and environmental responsibility.

Hazards of waste mixup

The hazards of mixing firecracker waste with general municipal waste are profound and multifaceted, according to Dr. Neeraj Verma, Chief Chemist at the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board in Bhopal.

“Even after firecrackers burn, residual gunpowder containing sulphur and heavy metals remains,” Dr. Verma explained. “When such waste reaches landfill sites, it can generate leachate—a toxic liquid that seeps into the ground, potentially contaminating groundwater resources.”

The environmental risks extend beyond water pollution. Mixing firecracker waste with organic waste compromises the quality of manure (produced with wet waste), rendering them potentially toxic. Moreover, the inherent flammability of firecracker residues poses significant fire hazards in garbage sites, which could generate poisonous smoke and further environmental degradation.

“It is critically important,” Dr. Verma emphasised, “that firecracker waste be properly segregated and then disposed of through scientific methods.”

The expert’s insights underscore the urgent need for specialised waste management protocols, particularly during festive seasons when firecracker usage peaks. Proper segregation and disposal are not merely environmental best practices but essential measures to protect public health and ecological systems.

Effective waste management requires a comprehensive approach that prioritises careful sorting, specialised handling, and scientifically sound disposal mechanisms.

Fireworks in the sky have adverse effects on the ground

In India, the celebration of momentary joy through fireworks extends far beyond Diwali and New Year’s Eve. Fireworks have become a ubiquitous spectacle in wedding processions and political victory celebrations. From the infamous 1000-bomb strings marking political triumphs to the 20-shot fireworks that create kaleidoscopic displays during weddings—these pyrotechnic displays offer fleeting visual pleasure at a significant environmental cost.

The environmental impact of these celebrations begins the moment fireworks burst into the sky. These spectacular displays leave behind a toxic legacy that persists long after the colours fade. At the heart of this environmental challenge is perchlorate, a chemical compound that serves as an oxidiser, enabling fireworks upward propulsion and creating their mesmerising patterns.

How does it pollute the soil?

When fireworks explode, they scatter chemical debris across the ground. Perchlorate, a key component, contaminates soil and water systems. This chemical is easily absorbed by vegetation, embedding itself in the natural ecosystem for extended periods. Research conducted in Kerala in 2021 confirmed the widespread soil contamination caused by fireworks.

The environmental degradation extends beyond chemical contamination. Firework particles can fundamentally alter soil nutrients and increase the acidity of surface water, creating cascading effects on local ecosystems. Atmospheric sulphur components, such as sulphur dioxide, can cause direct damage to plant life, impeding the growth of trees and leaves.

One more concern is the impact on aquatic environments. When these chemical residues enter water bodies, they can significantly disrupt fish growth and overall marine ecosystem health. The seemingly momentary celebration leaves a prolonged and profound imprint on the environment.

These findings underscore the need for a more environmentally conscious approach to celebrations, challenging the current cultural norm of using fireworks as a symbol of joy and festivity.

Conclusion

The environmental toll of firecrackers extends far beyond momentary spectacle. We must urgently transform societal awareness, helping people understand that their fleeting moments of celebration inflict long-lasting damage on our fragile ecosystems.

Administrative units bear a critical responsibility in implementing rigorous waste management protocols and scientific disposal mechanisms. As climate change presents increasingly complex challenges, mitigating human activities that harm nature becomes paramount. By making informed choices and prioritising environmental preservation, we can collectively reduce our ecological footprint and strengthen our resilience against global environmental threats.

IWM,"Regional Banks Suffer Worst Drop Since Trump's Tariff Shock: Here's Why - Customers Bancorp (NYSE:CUBI), Great Southern Bancorp (NASDAQ:GSBC)",,"After staging their strongest two-day rally in nearly a year earlier this week, U.S. regional banks reversed course dramatically on Thursday, with the group facing its steepest sell-off since the Trump tariff shock of April 2025.

The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) plunged 6.1% in afternoon trading, logging its worst single-day performance since April 4, when Donald Trump's sweeping Liberation Day tariffs triggered a broad market sell-off.

The sharp reversal is being driven by renewed fears of credit deterioration and unexpected loan losses at some mid-sized lenders—just days after investor optimism surged on hopes of rate cuts and strong bank earnings.

While smaller and mid-sized lenders bore the brunt of the sell-off, the damage also rippled up to larger Wall Street institutions. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) slid 2.8%, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 sector and marking its steepest one-day decline since April.

Chart: Regional Banks Crash As Credit Fears Emerge, KRE ETF Drops 5.6%

What Happened?

Shares of Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) collapsed 12.3% after the bank disclosed late Wednesday that it would record a $50 million charge-off in the third quarter related to two troubled commercial and industrial loans held by its California Bank & Trust unit.

The bank stated that total provisions for credit losses would amount to $60 million, with the full update expected in its earnings release on October 20.

A Truist Securities analyst described the episode as a ""step on a rake,"" highlighting that even isolated loan problems are enough to rattle a market already jittery about the broader credit cycle.

Compounding investor concerns, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), referenced growing risk in the credit market earlier this week, citing the recent bankruptcies of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts manufacturer.

“When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,” Dimon said, raising red flags across the sector.

Contagion Fears Spread

The fallout from Zions quickly spilled over. Western Alliance Bancorp (NYSE:WAL) dropped 10.4% after revealing it had filed a lawsuit against a borrower, alleging fraud. The Phoenix-based bank said it would provide more transparency on this credit exposure following a similar disclosure from a peer.

Other regional lenders also took heavy losses:

Great Southern Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:GSBC) fell 10%

Customers Bancorp Inc. (NYSE:CUBI) slid 9.5%

Hingham Institution for Savings (NASDAQ:HIFS) lost 9%

The Russell 2000 Index – tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) – where financials account for nearly 20% of the weighting, dropped 2%, snapping a three-day win streak as regional banks dragged the index sharply lower.

""Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I believe that the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points,"" Waller said, adding that policy should move toward a ""neutral level,"" which he estimates is 100 to 125 basis points lower than current levels.

The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all hovered near unchanged levels Thursday, while the Russell 2000 slipped 1%, reflecting weakness in small caps.

Wood Adds Deere, ATAI, and Pony.ai

The biggest buy came from the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and the ARK Space Exploration ETF (ARKX), which together added 9,386 shares of Deere & Co. (DE) worth about $4.29 million. Deere, the U.S. farm and construction equipment maker, saw its stake increased for the second time this week after a smaller earlier purchase. While not a usual space or tech stock, Deere’s growing use of AI and autonomous tools in farming aligns well with ARK’s focus on next-generation innovation.

Meanwhile, the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) added 725,281 shares of ATAI Life Sciences (ATAI) worth about $3.97 million. ATAI, a biotech firm focused on mental health treatments, continues to attract ARK’s attention as it expands its research pipeline.

In a smaller trade, ARKQ also bought 16,371 shares of Pony.ai (PONY) valued at about $334,000. The China-based self-driving technology company remains one of ARK’s consistent AI investments this month.

Wood Trims Stakes in Rocket Lab and Biotech Holdings

On the sell side, ARKQ and ARKX reduced their position in Rocket Lab Corp. (RKLB), selling 66,070 shares worth roughly $4.43 million. Rocket Lab, the aerospace manufacturer and satellite launch provider, has seen multiple rounds of trimming by ARK in recent sessions.

ARKG also cut its biotech exposure by selling 72,537 shares of Adaptive Biotechnologies (ADPT) valued at about $1.25 million and 71,147 shares of Natera Inc. (NTRA) worth $1.29 million. Both companies specialize in genetic testing and diagnostics, and the moves reflect a broader rebalancing within ARK’s healthcare holdings.

Additionally, ARKG sold 13,758 shares of Quantum-Si Inc. (QSI) for about $349,000. Quantum-Si, a semiconductor-based life sciences firm, has faced weak demand for its protein sequencing tools in recent quarters.

Ark Funds invests in disruptive technology and innovative companies that it believes will outperform on a five-year outlook. This often leads to favoring high-growth, technology-related names.

The company focuses on companies in sectors like fintech, cryptocurrency, electric vehicles, space exploration, genomics, AI and more.

Greene has said that she does not make her own trades, instead relying on a portfolio manager. She has regularly ranked as one of the top-performing traders in Congress based on annual portfolio returns.

Earlier this year, Greene praised the moves by her manager for buying stocks after they dipped due to pressure from tariff warnings from President Donald Trump, only to rise later with calls for a tariff pause.

“I don’t place my buys and sells,"" Greene said, citing an agreement she has with her portfolio manager, who handles all the buying and selling of stocks. “He did a great job. Guess what he did. He bought the dip. And that’s what anybody that has financial sense does.""

Greene also said her portfolio manager did not have inside information, everything was public and a potential tariff pause wasn’t a secret.

On Tuesday, October 14, Wood’s ARK funds were busy once again, featuring a mix of buys and sells across her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX). Here’s a closer look at what caught her attention.

It was a buying day for DraftKings (DKNG), with ARKK snapping up 236,289 shares of the online sports betting company. DraftKings has been at the forefront of the U.S. sports wagering boom, offering everything from fantasy leagues to mobile betting platforms across multiple states.

Meanwhile, ARKK trimmed its exposure to Brera Holdings (SLMT), selling 23,659 shares. The micro-cap company, known for its investments in sports management and media ventures, has seen its stock fluctuate sharply this year.

The fund also offloaded 30,276 shares of Roblox (RBLX). Roblox remains a dominant force in the gaming metaverse and its stock has been trading near all-time highs. The company continues to expand its immersive platform and monetize its vast user base, positioning itself as one of the leaders in interactive entertainment.

In her ARKX fund, Wood made a few small buys today. The fund picked up 8,901 shares of L3Harris Technologies (LHX), a major defense contractor and aerospace systems provider.

Wood also bought 2,966 shares of Deere & Co. (DE), the legendary agricultural and construction machinery maker. While Deere might not seem like a space or innovation play at first glance, its growing focus on autonomous and AI-driven farming technology fits neatly into ARK’s vision of tech-driven productivity.

Another addition came in DoorDash (DASH), with ARKX scooping up 4,823 shares. The food delivery leader continues to expand beyond takeout into groceries, convenience, and logistics.

On the selling side, ARKX pared back 3,890 shares of AeroVironment (AVAV), a drone and unmanned systems maker that has benefited from increased defense spending.

Finally, the biggest move in ARKX was the sale of 53,917 shares of Rocket Lab (RKLB). The space launch provider is ARKX’s largest core holding. It stands out as one of the few private-to-public success stories in the commercial space sector, offering small satellite launch services and developing advanced spacecraft components.

(NASDAQ:DKNG), Rocket Lab Corp (NASDAQ:RKLB), and DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH).

The DraftKings Trade

The ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK) fund purchased 236,289 shares of DraftKings on Tuesday. With DraftKings’ shares closing at $34.36, the transaction is valued at approximately $8.12 million.

This move comes as DraftKings faces mounting pressure from emerging competitors like Kalshi, which has been valued at $5 billion. The increased competition has led to heightened activity in sports betting ETFs.

The Rocket Lab Trade

In a notable trade, the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX) fund sold 53,917 shares of Rocket Lab on the same day. With shares closing at $68.03, the sale totaled approximately $3.7 million.

Rocket Lab has been in the spotlight following Morgan Stanley’s endorsement, which raised the price target to $68 and likened the company to an early-stage SpaceX. This endorsement has fueled interest in space-themed ETFs, including ARKX. The stock has surged over 25% over the last 30 days.

The DoorDash Trade

Ark’s ARKX fund also acquired 4,823 shares of DoorDash, with the shares closing at $270.54, resulting in a $1.3 million investment.

DoorDash is positioned to surpass Uber in free cash flow growth, driven by its dominant U.S. market position and international expansion. JP Morgan recently upgraded DoorDash’s rating to Overweight, with a new price target of $325, highlighting its strong market presence and growth potential.

ARKX,Space ETFs Poised to Boost Your Portfolio Gains,,"Driven by groundbreaking innovation and growing investor interest, the space economy is taking off. The S&P Kensho Space Index’s outperformance compared with the S&P 500 underscores rising confidence and a bullish market mood.

The space index has added 68.94% over the past year and 47.79% year to date, significantly outpacing the broad market index, which has gained 16.28% and 14.51% over the same period, respectively.

Investors Reaching for the Stars as Space Funding Soars

According to a recent report by Seraphim Space, as quoted on Reuters, in the third quarter, global space investment soared to a record $3.5 billion, fueled by a broader base of startups and sustained defense spending.

Funding across segments, from rocket manufacturers to low-Earth-orbit satellites, nearly doubled from $1.79 billion a year ago, positioning space as tech’s next big frontier after AI. As per the report, government initiatives to strengthen domestic space and defense industries in the United States, China and Europe are increasingly driving funding, with analysts anticipating this momentum to continue well into the next year.

Per Seraphim Space’s investment associate, Lucas Bishop, a growing variety of investable space companies are entering the market, highlighting the space sector’s transition into a mature and well-rounded market, as quoted on the abovementioned Reuters article.

Exploring the Cosmos

Space tourism is being driven by growing interest from adventure seekers, strong enthusiasm among high-net-worth individuals, and increased R&D investment from both government and private sectors.

According to Grand View Research, the global space tourism market is projected to reach $10.09 billion by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 44.8% from 2024 to 2030.

How Space Tech Fuels Climate and Defense Frontiers

Space technology is taking on a pivotal role in climate control. With global investments increasingly prioritizing climate control, advancements in the broader space economy hold further promise.

Already integral to disaster warning and management, space technology's role is expected to expand significantly with improved climate disaster monitoring, resilient communication network access and optimized tracking through satellite positioning data.

Additionally, space is becoming integral to defense operations. With modern warfare evolving and drone technology advancing, nations are increasingly investing in space-based systems to strengthen their military capabilities.

The Golden Dome missile defense concept of the United States highlights this fact. Also, at the Space Defense and Security Summit, according to DefenseNews, several NATO members emphasized that space is now a warfighting domain, demanding faster response and updated defense strategies.

ETFs to Explore

With growing interest in interstellar exploration and growing capital infusion in the space sector, increasing exposure to funds covering the space economy can be beneficial. Additionally, the shift in warfare technology, resulting in the militarization of space —a trend already gaining momentum —could also increase investments in the space economy.

Although space ETFs carry higher volatility, they offer distinct long-term growth potential. Below, we highlight a few funds that investors can consider to gain increased exposure to the space economy.

Investors can consider ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF ARKX, Spear Alpha ETF SPRX, Procure Space ETF UFO and SPDR S&P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF ROKT.

With a one-month average trading volume of 289,900 shares, ARKX is the most liquid option, ideal for active trading strategies. However, to fully benefit from the sector’s growth trajectory, a long-term investment approach is recommended.

ARKX has also gathered an asset base of $528 billion, the largest among the other options. Regarding annual fees, ROKT is the cheapest option, charging 0.45%, which makes it more suitable for long-term investing.

Wood Boosts Bets on DoorDash, Deere, and Alibaba

ARK’s biggest move of the day was a $6.9 million purchase of DoorDash (DASH) through the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX). The food-delivery company has been a key beneficiary of rising demand for online ordering, and Wood’s latest buy signals growing confidence in its growth outlook and expanding logistics network.

In another notable trade, ARK increased its stake in Deere & Co (DE), buying 7,274 shares worth about $3.37 million through ARKQ. The agricultural machinery maker has been a recurring addition to ARK’s funds in recent weeks, aligning with the firm’s conviction in automation and precision farming.

ARK also bought 4,449 shares of Alibaba Group (BABA) for about $836,545 through the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), taking another step in building its stake in the Chinese online retail giant. Additionally, the firm expanded positions in L3Harris Technologies (LHX) and MercadoLibre (MELI), investing roughly $5.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively. In genomics, ARKG purchased 19,875 shares of GeneDx Holdings (WGS) valued at $2.35 million, reinforcing its interest in next-generation health innovation.

ARK Reduces Exposure to Adaptive and AeroVironment

On the sell side, ARK cut its stake in Adaptive Biotechnologies (ADPT), selling 180,169 shares from the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) worth $2.59 million. The move may show caution toward short-term swings in the biotech space.

ARK also reduced its holding in AeroVironment (AVAV), a drone maker, selling 13,969 shares through ARKQ and ARKX ETFs for $5.23 million. Smaller cuts were made in Kratos Defense (KTOS), Rocket Lab (RKLB), and Brera Holdings (SLMT), with total proceeds of more than $11 million.

ARKX,Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) Hits New 52-Week High,,"For investors seeking momentum, ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and soared 97.4% from its 52-week low of $15.07 per share.

Are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s briefly examine the fund and its near-term outlook to gain a better understanding of where it might be headed:

ARKX in Focus

This is an actively managed Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that seeks long-term capital growth by primarily investing in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies engaged in the fund’s investment theme of space exploration and innovation. ARKX ETF charges 75 basis points (bps) in annual fees (see: all the Industries ETFs here).

What Led to the Surge?

Surging demand for satellite constellations, amid increasing need for reliable access to space to support telecommunications, Earth observation, and national security missions, combined with rapidly accelerating government and corporate investments in space exploration and innovations, can be expected to have driven the upside in space stocks and thereby ETFs like ARKX.

More Gains Ahead?

ARKX may remain strong, given its positive weighted alpha of 88.73 (per barchart.com). The ETF still offers some potential for investors seeking to benefit from its surge.

Research Chief Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""

ARKX,"Rocket Lab Ignites Space ETF Rally As Investors Seek The Next SpaceX - ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX), Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)",,"Rocket Lab Corp (NASDAQ:RKLB) has rekindled investor attention on the space economy following a solid endorsement from Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the stock to $68 from $20, a 240% increase, and compared the company to an “earlier-stage alternative to SpaceX.”

The action has caused ripples in the space-themed ETF ecosystem, where funds such as the Procure Space ETF (NASDAQ:UFO), ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX), and SPDR S&P Kensho Final Frontiers ETF (NYSE:ROKT) are riding a tailwind.

UFO ETF has gained significantly this year thanks to the developments in the space economy. Track its prices.

Morgan Stanley Turns Up The Thrust

Morgan Stanley analysts see Rocket Lab as the ""clear small-launch leader,"" forecasting roughly 41% compound annual sales growth between 2025 and 2029. The firm expects the company to turn positive on adjusted EBITDA by 2026 and on free cash flow by 2027, helped by an expanding launch cadence and the debut of its Neutron rocket later this year.

The market is now basing valuation on RKLB from implied valuation in SpaceX, the note stated, predicting that Rocket Lab can emerge as the closest proxy to Elon Musk’s privately owned firm. The brokerage also cited a global supply squeeze of launch capacity and a solid order book from Rocket Lab as the chief drivers of the re-rating.

ETFs Find Lift From Rocket Lab’s Orbit

ETFs with rocket exposure have moved quickly on the optimism. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest runs ARKX, which holds RKLB among its top aerospace holdings. ARKX is up 1.8% Tuesday, as of time of publishing. Meanwhile, UFO, the first-ever pure-play space ETF, also includes the company among its key holdings and is up almost 3% on Tuesday. The ROKT ETF, which follows companies concentrating on space and deep-ocean exploration, has also gotten a boost, gaining 1.5% on Tuesday afternoon.

These ETFs are now being considered liquid doorways into the commercial space revolution, providing investors with exposure to a market that is still controlled by private behemoths. With SpaceX still not within reach, funds are looking to Rocket Lab as the next best thing.

New Contracts Signal Liftoff

Rocket Lab’s recent transactions have only reinforced the bullish sentiment. The firm signed a deal with Japan’s space agency, JAXA, for two sole Electron rocket flights and extended contracts with Japanese satellite companies Synspective and Q-shu Pioneers of Space. Combined, these represent a record pipeline of launches, over 20 missions scheduled for 2025.

For “new space” ETFs betting on the frontier, Rocket Lab’s climb provides both storybook fuel and actual earnings momentum.

On Monday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made significant trades, notably increasing its stake in DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) , while reducing its position in Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:BREA) and Rocket Lab Corp. (NASDAQ:RKLB).

The DoorDash Trade

Ark Invest made a substantial purchase of DoorDash shares across the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF

(BATS:ARKQ) and ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX). On Monday, DoorDash’s stock closed at $281.74, marking a 3.88% increase. Ark’s purchase of 25,581 shares translates to an investment of approximately $7.2 million.

This surge followed the announcement of a new multi-year partnership with Criteo S.A., aimed at enhancing advertising opportunities across DoorDash's platform. The collaboration is set to expand media placements and integrate advertising technologies, capitalizing on the rapid growth of retail media.

The Alibaba Trade

Ark Invest bought 4,449 shares of Alibaba through its ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK), valued at around $832,000 based on Monday’s closing price of $187.22.

Alibaba’s stock has been on an upward trajectory, driven by its aggressive push into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. This momentum has positioned Alibaba as a top-performing Chinese tech stock, with a year-to-date gain of over 120%. The company’s focus on AI has been a significant factor in its recent performance.

Notably, Ark snapped up $2.74 million worth of Alibaba shares last Thursday, continuing its steady buying streak in the Jack Ma-founded company. The firm had already added $5.5 million worth of shares on Wednesday and $4.1 million the day before.

The Brera Holdings Trade

Ark Invest trimmed its stake in Brera Holdings, unloading 54,400 shares from its ARKK ETF. The stock ended the session at $21.91, down 11.94%, with the sale valued at roughly $1.2 million.

Brera Holdings recently made headlines with its Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) Treasury Strategy, which initially led to a 225% surge in its stock. However, the stock has since seen a pullback, reflecting market volatility and investor sentiment.

Ark has been selling Brea stock lately, with $1.1 million worth of shares sold last Thursday. Last month, Ark had picked up 6,500,001 shares worth $162 million.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived Homes

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo Idle Cash

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated.

ARKX,2 Defense Stocks Riding 2025's Massive Momentum Wave,,"To this day, an age-old battle between stock market investing strategies wages: value versus momentum. Value investing is a tactic famously employed by legends like Warren Buffett. It seeks to identify stocks with depressed valuations, often due to disruptions perceived as temporary.

On the other hand, many investors deploy a momentum strategy. It relies on the idea that stocks that have risen substantially in a short period tend to continue rising. In 2025, momentum has been the clear winner among these competing ideologies. The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF NYSEARCA: SPMO has returned 27% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF NYSEARCA: IVE has returned only around 10%.

Riding the momentum wave are two highly interesting defense stocks, with each soaring more than 100% in 2025. Below, we’ll provide perspective on what the future may hold for these two names, with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios well above 100x.

KTOS: Unmanned Jet Stock Keeps Flying to New Heights

First up is Kratos Defense and Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS. From a business perspective, this company is compelling. It is leading the charge when it comes to futuristic defense technologies, such as unmanned and even autonomous jet fighters. Through August, Kratos’ shares gained approximately 150% in 2025, putting its forward P/E ratio at around 104x. Such a high figure immediately elicits fears of overvaluation among many investors. However, the stock has done anything but fall since then.

From the end of August to now, the stock has gained another 46%, placing its forward P/E at a massive 149x. Surely, not all of Kratos’s gains over the past month or so have come purely due to momentum. It has released multiple pieces of positive news. This includes joining the S&P MidCap 400 Index and winning a drone manufacturing contract of unspecified value. Still, it's hard to say these announcements warrant such a large increase in Kratos’s share price.

Some warning signs are flashing around Kratos. The stock’s relative strength index (RSI) has surged well above 70 to around 85, indicating that it may be considerably overbought. Additionally, high-profile investor Cathie Wood sold around 9% of the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF’s BATS: ARKX allocation to Kratos in September. Still, Kratos remains by far the fund's largest holding, making up around 13.6% of its portfolio. Lastly, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Kratos of $63.50 implies around 34% downside in shares.

KRMN’s Forward P/E Blasts Past 140x

Next is Karman NYSE: KRMN, another business with many things to like. It is a high-margin, vertically integrated supplier of mission-critical components to prime defense contractors. Karman went public in February and gained an extremely impressive 78% by the end of August.

By then, the stock was trading at around a 101x forward P/E ratio. Just like Kratos, Karman shares haven’t looked back since. From the end of August to now, the stock has gained another 36%, putting its forward P/E ratio at around 140x. Much of this came due to Raymond James placing a $100 price target on the stock, which sent shares up 17% in one day.

Still, this target is an outlier, standing in significant contrast to the MarketBeat consensus target of $68, which implies around 7% downside in shares. Karman itself has not made any press releases over the past month. However, analysts at Evercore ISI did raise their price target to $75, implying a slight amount of upside. Karman’s RSI is also a concern. It sits at 76 and has been above the overbought level of 70 for around a month.

KTOS & KRMN: Bearish Signals Emerge, But Their Risky Rallies Could Continue

Overall, there are some notable red flags surrounding Kratos and Karman shares. At the very least, they provide a sense that investors may want to consider taking some money off the table. Still, if Palantir Technologies NASDAQ: PLTR is any indication, it seems hard to bet against high-flying defense stocks right now. Palantir has soared to an astronomical 233x forward P/E, over doubling in price since the figure hit 150x in April. Ultimately, there remains a significant chance that Kratos and Karman could keep rising. But these two names are clearly not without substantial risk at current prices. They will need to show excellent execution in their upcoming earnings releases to justify their valuations.

ARKX,"Cathie Wood Unloads This Rocket Stock, Pours $7M Into DoorDash -- But Won't Stop Buying This Chinese Giant - Alibaba Gr Hldgs (NYSE:BABA)",,"On Monday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made significant trades, notably increasing its stake in DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) , while reducing its position in Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:BREA) and Rocket Lab Corp. (NASDAQ:RKLB).

The DoorDash Trade

Ark Invest made a substantial purchase of DoorDash shares across the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF

(BATS:ARKQ) and ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX). On Monday, DoorDash’s stock closed at $281.74, marking a 3.88% increase. Ark’s purchase of 25,581 shares translates to an investment of approximately $7.2 million.

This surge followed the announcement of a new multi-year partnership with Criteo S.A., aimed at enhancing advertising opportunities across DoorDash's platform. The collaboration is set to expand media placements and integrate advertising technologies, capitalizing on the rapid growth of retail media.

The Alibaba Trade

Ark Invest bought 4,449 shares of Alibaba through its ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK), valued at around $832,000 based on Monday’s closing price of $187.22.

Alibaba’s stock has been on an upward trajectory, driven by its aggressive push into cloud computing and artificial intelligence. This momentum has positioned Alibaba as a top-performing Chinese tech stock, with a year-to-date gain of over 120%. The company’s focus on AI has been a significant factor in its recent performance.

Notably, Ark snapped up $2.74 million worth of Alibaba shares last Thursday, continuing its steady buying streak in the Jack Ma-founded company. The firm had already added $5.5 million worth of shares on Wednesday and $4.1 million the day before.

The Brera Holdings Trade

Ark Invest trimmed its stake in Brera Holdings, unloading 54,400 shares from its ARKK ETF. The stock ended the session at $21.91, down 11.94%, with the sale valued at roughly $1.2 million.

Brera Holdings recently made headlines with its Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) Treasury Strategy, which initially led to a 225% surge in its stock. However, the stock has since seen a pullback, reflecting market volatility and investor sentiment.

Ark has been selling Brea stock lately, with $1.1 million worth of shares sold last Thursday. Last month, Ark had picked up 6,500,001 shares worth $162 million.

The Rocket Lab Trade

Ark Invest sold 86,326 shares of Rocket Lab Corp across its ARKQ and ARKX ETFs. The stock closed at $58.50, up by 4.17%. The transactions were valued at nearly $5 million.

Rocket Lab recently announced a multi-launch contract with Synspective, a Japanese satellite data company. This agreement adds 10 more launches, bringing the total to 21, highlighting Rocket Lab’s growing presence in the satellite launch market.

Other Key Trades

Ark Invest purchased 1,740 shares of MercadoLibre Inc. through the ARKF ETF.

Sold 180,169 shares of Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp from the ARKG ETF.

Bought 254,642 shares of ATAI Life Sciences NV via the ARKG ETF.

Acquired 11,139 shares of L3Harris Technologies Inc. through the ARKQ ETF and 8,354 shares through ARKK.

Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings show that Alibaba Group shares have a Quality in the 42nd percentile. Here is how the stock compares to its Chinese peers.

Chicago, IL – October 3, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group MUFG, Workday WDAY and Ciena CIEN.

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:

Balancing Bulls & Bears: Zacks October Market Strategy

The following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank’s full Oct Market Strategy report To access the full PDF, click here.

This month? I focus the U.S. market’s 2026 outlook — on a balance —

between bull and bear views.

For 2026 bulls:

(A) Annual EPS growth outlooks for the S&P500 index members (done by Zacks on Sept. 26th, 2025) remain supportive:

+10.8% got marked across 2024, with annual outlooks for y/y EPS growth of:

+9.4% for 2025

+12.7% for 2026, and

+13.8% for 2027

(B) There are substantial liquidity catalysts, in play, from global monetary authorities:

· Consider a dovish employment-mandate focused FOMC at a 4.08% Fed Funds policy rate

· An ECB in Europe already at a 2.00% main refi policy rate, and

· A Mainland China People’s Bank 1-year loan policy rate holding at a 3.0% rate

Long-term U.S. Treasuries? The 10-year U.S. yield was 4.14% on Sept. 30th, 2025.

Bond vigilantes can return, particularly if the Supreme Court nullifies U.S. “emergency” tariffs.

“Big Beautiful Bill” fiscal effects have not shown up. Income tax benefits arrive during the April tax filing season in 2026. Medicare cuts happen after the Nov. 2026 election.

(C) Below is the Sept. 2025 London & CME Consensus, for cuts in the Fed Funds rate:

· 3.75% at the end of Dec. 2025 (with 89% CME Fed odds for 1 25-bps cut by YE)

· 3.32% at the end of June 2026 (with 96% CME odds for 3-4 added 25-bps cuts)

· 3.15% at the end of December 2026 (with 29% CME odds for five total 25-bps cuts; AND another added 30% CME odds for more than that!)

For 2026 bears:

(A) Notably, a majority of FOMC members are pessimistic on U.S. labor markets in 2026.

A sustained 5-year-long rise to ~3.0% y/y in the core PCE inflation rate (perhaps augmented more by U.S. tariffs) and forecasts for a lowered +1.7% real GDP growth across 2025 and 2026, solidify a U.S. stagflation scenario.

That’s a major threat for bulls.

The Sept. 17th, 2025 “dot plots” offered by the FOMC?

The FOMC median 2025 Fed Fund rate is 3.6%. This amounts to three in total 25 bps cuts, to YE 2025.

But a big tail of FOMC ‘“dot plot” projections skew much higher (7 votes are for no more 2025 Fed Funds policy cuts).

In brief, Fed Funds cuts this fall may NOT supply short-term liquidity for U.S. stocks.

The FOMC median ‘dot plot’ at YE 2026 is 3.4%. That is only 75 bps cuts from 4.08%.

However, there remains a big tail of projections for a much lower Fed Funds rate, by the end of 2026. That amounts to a de facto “hard landing” recession risk.

(B) There is a potential for unprecedented White House control over the FOMC. But that would also require a Supreme Court ruling. That won’t happen until 2026.

Before that ruling, I think if President Trump (and his team of advisors) smell panic from Fed Chair Powell, they will ramp up the attacks on him.

New FOMC member and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran can play the role of an added ‘black hat’ along with FHFA Director Bill Pulte, to increase the political pressure.

Fed Chair Powell flinching and signaling a resignation would be a game changer for the bond markets. Regardless, Chair Powell’s 2nd 4-year term ends on May 15th, 2026.

While his term as Chair concludes in May 2026, Powell's separate and non-renewable 14-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors does not expire until January 31st, 2028. However, it is customary for a Fed Chair to step down from the Board when their term as Chair ends.

On top of that? We now have a Federal Government shutdown. Permanent job cuts are coming.

The stock market is euphoric, for momentum trading reasons.

FOMO more than anything seems to have underpriced FOMC regime risk, the weak U.S. job market, and Federal shutdown risk. AND vastly over-priced the “AI” revolution.

(C) Entering October 2025, S&P500 traders’ price-in aggressive full-year 2026 and 2027 earnings estimates.

Data pulled on Sept. 24th, 2025 from Zacks systems showed:

· The S&P500 LargeCap had a 25.8 P/E using ’25, 22.9 for ’26, and 20.2 on ’27

· The S&P400 MidCap had a 19.2 P/E using ’25, 16.4 for ’26, and 14.4 on ‘27

· The S&P600 SmallCap had a 18.7 P/E using ’25, 15.6 for ’26 and 13.4 on ‘27

If traders use 2026 F12M P/E ratios, mid-cap U.S. equity indices look fairly valued at 16.4. Much-loved large caps at 22.9 are relentlessly undergoing a valuation expansion.

What about using the closer-in 2025 earnings outlooks?

A 25.8 F12M P/E ratio for the S&P500 market weight index looks shockingly rich.

What about the map cap S&P400 index?

The midcap S&P400 at a 19.2 P/E ratio using 2025 model earnings is rich.

The midcap S&P400 at 16.4 in 2026? Where the mid cap’s index value looks OK, if no major growth slowdown augurs in.

The small-cap S&P600 looks cheap for a reason. That reason is a probable concentration of future tariff suffering — inside small and mid-sized U.S. firms.

The S&P600 shows a 18.7 ratio using its model ’25 earnings. That is not attractive. All that happened over the last month was a valuation expansion.

The S&P600 has a 15.6 P/E ratio using model ’26 earnings. That is just OK.

(D) Abitcoin pricecollapse is a major financial instability threat.

3x to 4x market beta bitcoin is embedded in the U.S. equity trading landscape. Bitcoin headed down from a record high at $123K to $113K recently.

On top of that? Market weight (aka “Mag 7” dependent) large cap U.S. share valuations continue to expand, and become increasingly rich.

That’s concentration risk.

And finally, entering October 2025, all of the Cathie Wood ‘Innovation’ tech ETFs have been accelerating…

Next is a forced ranking, based on ETF annualized returns—

ARKB ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF

ARKQ Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF

ARKW Next Generation Internet ETF

ARKF Fintech Innovation ETF

ARKK ARK Innovation ETF (the flagship fund)

ARKX Space Exploration & Innovation ETF

Zacks October 2025 Sector/Industry/Company Telescope

Sept. 30th, 2025 data showed a narrow leader: Just Financials were at Very Attractive.

Zacks Industry rankings delivered 2 Attractive Sectors: Info Tech & Communications.

Info Tech earnings growth remains well-supported by “AI” data/cloud centers and strong tech mega-cap earnings.

Ditto Communication Services.

Health Care and the Energy sector were at a Market Weight rating this month.

Materials rose a notch to an Unattractive rating.

Consumer Staples fell to a Very Unattractive rating.

Consumer Discretionary held Very Unattractive ratings.

With both Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary at the very back of this ranked order, share investor concern should be rising — on the status of a weak U.S. job market hitting consumer spending.

Next are my top Zacks-Ranked stock picks, from the top-ranked Zacks sectors.

(1) Financials stayed Very Attractive. Major Banks, Real Estate, and Investment Banking looked best.

Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group

(2) Info Tech fell to Attractive from Very Attractive. Computer-Software led.

Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: Workday

(3) Communications Services stayed Attractive. Telco Equipment was best. Again.

Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: Ciena

Note: This pick is a classic example of “AI” froth!

ARKX,2 Defense Stocks Riding 2025's Massive Momentum Wave,,"To this day, an age-old battle between stock market investing strategies wages: value versus momentum. Value investing is a tactic famously employed by legends like Warren Buffett. It seeks to identify stocks with depressed valuations, often due to disruptions perceived as temporary.

On the other hand, many investors deploy a momentum strategy. It relies on the idea that stocks that have risen substantially in a short period tend to continue rising. In 2025, momentum has been the clear winner among these competing ideologies. The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA: SPMO) has returned 27% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: IVE) has returned only around 10%.

Riding the momentum wave are two highly interesting defense stocks, with each soaring more than 100% in 2025. Below, we’ll provide perspective on what the future may hold for these two names, with their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios well above 100x.

KTOS: Unmanned Jet Stock Keeps Flying to New Heights

First up is Kratos Defense and Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS). From a business perspective, this company is compelling. It is leading the charge when it comes to futuristic defense technologies, such as unmanned and even autonomous jet fighters. Through August, Kratos’ shares gained approximately 150% in 2025, putting its forward P/E ratio at around 104x. Such a high figure immediately elicits fears of overvaluation among many investors. However, the stock has done anything but fall since then.

From the end of August to now, the stock has gained another 46%, placing its forward P/E at a massive 149x. Surely, not all of Kratos’s gains over the past month or so have come purely due to momentum. It has released multiple pieces of positive news. This includes joining the S&P MidCap 400 Index and winning a drone manufacturing contract of unspecified value. Still, it's hard to say these announcements warrant such a large increase in Kratos’s share price.

Some warning signs are flashing around Kratos. The stock’s relative strength index (RSI) has surged well above 70 to around 85, indicating that it may be considerably overbought. Additionally, high-profile investor Cathie Wood sold around 9% of the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF’s (BATS: ARKX) allocation to Kratos in September. Still, Kratos remains by far the fund's largest holding, making up around 13.6% of its portfolio. Lastly, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Kratos of $63.50 implies around 34% downside in shares.

KRMN’s Forward P/E Blasts Past 140x

Next is Karman (NYSE: KRMN), another business with many things to like. It is a high-margin, vertically integrated supplier of mission-critical components to prime defense contractors. Karman went public in February and gained an extremely impressive 78% by the end of August.

By then, the stock was trading at around a 101x forward P/E ratio. Just like Kratos, Karman shares haven’t looked back since. From the end of August to now, the stock has gained another 36%, putting its forward P/E ratio at around 140x. Much of this came due to Raymond James placing a $100 price target on the stock, which sent shares up 17% in one day.

Still, this target is an outlier, standing in significant contrast to the MarketBeat consensus target of $68, which implies around 7% downside in shares. Karman itself has not made any press releases over the past month. However, analysts at Evercore ISI did raise their price target to $75, implying a slight amount of upside. Karman’s RSI is also a concern. It sits at 76 and has been above the overbought level of 70 for around a month.

KTOS & KRMN: Bearish Signals Emerge, But Their Risky Rallies Could Continue

Overall, there are some notable red flags surrounding Kratos and Karman shares. At the very least, they provide a sense that investors may want to consider taking some money off the table. Still, if Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is any indication, it seems hard to bet against high-flying defense stocks right now. Palantir has soared to an astronomical 233x forward P/E, over doubling in price since the figure hit 150x in April. Ultimately, there remains a significant chance that Kratos and Karman could keep rising. But these two names are clearly not without substantial risk at current prices. They will need to show excellent execution in their upcoming earnings releases to justify their valuations.

ARKX,"Cathie Wood's China Bet: Ark Buys Alibaba's AI Surge And Baidu's Autonomous Future, Dump's Stock Of Crypto-Pivot Brera - ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK)",,"On Tuesday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made significant trades involving Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), and Brera Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:BREA).

The Baidu Trade

ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK) purchased 52,388 shares of Baidu. The trade, valued at approximately $6.9 million, comes amid Baidu’s aggressive expansion of its Apollo Go robotaxi business into new markets.

Baidu is in talks with governments in Australia and Southeast Asia to introduce its autonomous vehicles. This expansion follows the granting of 50 trial licenses in Dubai, allowing Baidu to expand its fleet in the UAE, according to a recent report.

The Alibaba Trade

ARKK acquired 23,538 shares of the Jack Ma-founded company. The transaction, valued at around $4.1 million, aligns with Alibaba’s recent stock performance, which has been buoyed by its push into cloud computing and AI.

Alibaba’s stock has risen 29% over the past month. On Tuesday, it declined 0.65% to $178.73. The stock recently hit its 52-week high of $182.15, driven by the company’s AI endeavors and outperforming the NYSE Composite index. Alibaba's Qwen3-Omni AI system topped Hugging Face's trending model list last week, with multiple variants securing leading spots and outperforming rivals including OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini in key benchmarks. The company's models now make up half of Hugging Face's top 10, surpassing Meta's Llama.

The Brera Holdings Trade

Ark Invest’s ARKK ETF sold 231,903 shares of Brera Holdings, valued at approximately $6.6 million. This move follows Brera Holdings’ recent volatility, as highlighted in a recent report.

Brera had experienced a significant rally last month after announcing its Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) Treasury strategy. The company is due to rebrand as Solmate after an oversubscribed $300 million private equity investment in a public equity offering. Earlier in September, Ark Invest acquired 6,500,001 shares of Brera, worth nearly $162 million.

Other Key Trades

ARKG bought 50,222 shares of Intellia Therapeutics Inc. while ARKK purchased 48,592 shares of the company.

ARKX acquired 263,700 shares of JD Logistics Inc.

ARKX sold 16,048 shares of Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc.

Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show that Alibaba stock has a quality in the 39th percentile. Here is how it ranks against other trending AI plays.

Pelosi's husband has a history of buying call options that are in the money and have expiration dates of a year from the purchase date. He later exercised the options into common stock.
