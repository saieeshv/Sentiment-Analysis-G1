SPY,1ogonw5,investing,Help me understand why I shouldn't sell my long term rental and just sell covered calls on SPY,"\*\*reposting here since it was deleted from r/realestateinvesting Have had a rental home operating for a little under 10 years. It is a 2 bed/1bath at 1200 square feet in what I would call a B- neighborhood. The home had a 15 year mortgage taken out in 2012 and has about $15k in principle left. Rental income is currently at $1495/month. averaging the various online real estate sites and looking at recent sales I'd estimate the current sales value at around $225k. The roof, HVAC, and fence are all less than 5 years old, so if we do continue to rent, we should be clear of any large CAPEX items for several years. When we pay off the home in 2027, assuming we are still at $1495 per month, after taxes and insurance it comes out to $977 (again, assuming T&I doesnt keep rising at a ridiculous rate). Accounting for management, vacancy, repairs and future CAPEX I am calculating around $560 per month. Assuming 2% annual appreciation, that adds another $375/month (first year) for a total of $960/month. If I were to sell the home today at the $225k, after realtor fees, depreciation recapture, taxes, mortgage pay off, capital gains, minor repairs etc, I am coming up with around $175k in cash. Now for my theory: say I take this $175k and add some savings to get to $203k so I can buy 300 shares of SPY at its current trading price of $677. Tracking this for a bit, I can sell 0.25 delta covered calls that are one week out for around $1.75 each. This would put the gross income at $525/week, not accounting for any appreciation. I don't need to show the math to prove that this comes out to higher than the $960/month from my rental. two outcomes of this weekly position: 1. SPY increases past my strike. I roll the option into the following week, profit is locked up in the sell/buy but still a net increase. 2. SPY trades below my strike by whatever amount and I just keep the premium. There are of course pros and cons to both options. An obvious risk to point out with the CC option is that the market could plummet at any point and my $200k could fall to $100k or lower. If, in theory, I do not plan to cash out this position and spend it anytime within the next couple decades (similar to holding the cash in the rental equity) I'm not concerned over that other than the income from the premiums would shrink as well. There are also obvious cons to the rental that are not captured in the $960 above as well. A bad tenant, liability, extended vacancy, reduction in rent (probably tied to the market 'crash' scenario above) all could impact the profitability. I have also looked into selling this property or pulling a HELOC to buy other rentals. At the current values and interest rates I just can't get any properties I come across to make sense at all. I am open to other suggestions or pointing out of pitfalls or other details I am not considering.

VOO,1nzggcq,investing,VOO and chill in retirement,"For those who like this approach, what's your plan in retirement? Say you have $1 mm in VOO, in today's prices you would hold 1626 shares. Let's say you need $4000\mo from your investment account to fund your living expenses on top of your ss income. You would need to sell 6.5 shares monthly or 78 shares yearly to meet this requirement. If voo grows at 14%, your growth will outpace your sells (228 new vs 78 sold) which is sustainable. But if the market drops like in the 2008 gfc, let's say your shares drop to $400 each, you'll need to sell 120 shares to meet your income needs. In this scenario your 1626 shares drop to 1506 shares. And each year until recovery your share count will drop. A 5 year recovery could mean a loss of 600 shares dropping to 1000 total, a 40% decline in your nest egg. Alternatively, would you consider investing in something like spyi instead? In today's prices you would hold 19,230 shares with $1mm. That would generate around $10,000\month in income. If the market tanked as in the above scenario, and say your investment income dropped by half, you would still have $5000\month investment income, without having to sell anything while still invested in a sp500 fund... Just like VOO. And if spyi continues in recovery to pay 12% while the sp500 grows at 14%, there should be no nav erosion either. Thoughts? Edit: correction to sp500 growth should probably be closer to 11% since inception rather than 14% (over the last 15 years).",54,221,2025-10-06 11:29:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nzggcq/voo_and_chill_in_retirement/,2025-10-29 14:25:51.850754,1.0,$VOO,0.8,[],['loss'],0.9057142857142856,Broad Market ETF

SPY,1o19zvz,Bogleheads,Rebalancing from 100% SPY,"Before I discovered the Boglehead philosophy, I just put everything (both taxable and tax deferred) in SPY. For the past several years I've been migrating toward a three-fund portfolio. I've gotten as close as possible to my target allocation by rebalancing within tax-advantaged accounts, but I'm still pretty far away and have more risk than I want at < 10 years from retirement. Further rebalancing would require selling in taxable, which would incur 15% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT. Should I: * Rebalance with future purchases, and not worry about never reaching my target allocation. * Slowly rebalance, selling the largest gain lots first * Slowly rebalance, selling the smallest gain lots first * Rebalance all at once, and take a giant tax hit. (likely the worst option) * Something else I'd appreciate any advice or ideas. EDIT: I should have mentioned, I turned off dividend reinvestment as soon as I noticed the issue a few years ago. All SPY dividends get moved into VXUS, but SP500 growth has been so dramatic that it hardly makes a difference in the overall allocation. UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions. I've gone with option 3 - rebalance slowly by selling lots with small capital gains, and staying under the 15% LTCG rate.",47,21,2025-10-08 13:07:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1o19zvz/rebalancing_from_100_spy/,2025-10-29 14:27:10.225059,1.0,$SPY,0.5,[],['dividend'],0.9057142857142856,Broad Market ETF

I'm getting calls non-stop, emails, mailers. It's also not clear what all the proposal are going to do. One says a change in share lending. Does this mean they're going to start loaning shares for shorting purposes? Does this actually help or harm shareholders?

I also have VOO and SCHD (obviously it's been doing well since 2017). Main goal: don't be homeless when AI comes for my job. I had a decent amount of extra money sitting in a safe Schwab managed account. When the market went down in the end of 2023 I got inspired and said fuck it, and put it all in on QQQ (I know QQQ has lots overlap with VOO but I wanted take a bigger swing). It's done well, it's doubled. But the AI bubble might burst sson and all the tech companies in QQQ crash. My instinct is to let it ride. I plan to not need it in the next 10 years. I've thought that maybe I could sell the gains and put it in a safer investment, just play with the house's money. Or sell ALL of it, maybe I'm overexposed to the S & P 500.

What is advised in terms of your stop losses for a large VOO holding in the case of a 15% pullback in the market?

Of course, there would be a tax situation, but that would only be relevant for gains, and I only have two years of gains with my set it and forget it VOO portfolio, and so my tax hit wouldn't be huge (this would change after years of course).

SPY,1o48yf4,Bogleheads,"Short, medium, and long term after a crash","I looked into what happened after the 2008 crash. I am just using SPY (S&P 500) and VDC (consumer staples) as examples here: you could use VTI or VT for broad market indexes and there are other ""stable"" sectors, like utilities, that this analysis should still hold true for. While both SPY and VDC fell in the crash, VDC fell less. While both recovered after the crash, VDC recovered a year and a half earlier. And while the S&P 500 has by far the better long term performance it took SPY well over a decade to catch back up to VDC. Bonds of course fell by less, holding their value better in the three years after the crash. VDC caught back up to BND in fall 2012, SPY caught back up to BND a year later. So there's three time ranges: - short term BND preserved spending power during and immediately - VDC recovered faster and provided better growth over the next ten years - long term S&P 500 dominates Therefore I'm thinking of allocating something like this: 40% VTI (VT if you want int'l) 30% VDC and similar 30% BND and similar (TIPS, bills) I think this might be better than 60/40 because it uses VDC to better fund the decade after a crash, and although VDC is slower growing, overall 70% equities is still pretty aggressive.

However unless I have cash on hand to buy the dip that can’t really be done and to have cash on hand I’d have to risk missing out on returns now which may lead to less returns overall if a major dip doesn’t come soon. Big believer in the whole more money is lost hedging for a downturn than in the actual downturn. As an alternative to holding cash Iv been exploring holding leveraged funds during a downturn. Looking at charts of TQQQ it has had some enormous gains overall. Ik Ik it’s been an incredible bull run and that might not continue but not considering buying at highs and holding forever. Instead I was thinking something like at 10% draw back of QQQ shifting contributions to TQQQ which would make up a really small portion of my portfolio then every couple weeks re evaluate. If it continues to drop keep contributing to it. At say a 30% drop start shifting holdings to TQQQ and so on buying all the way down. As an exit strategy I would sell and put it back to normal allocations of S&P500 international, etc. once market returns to a new ATH or maybe just hold 1 more year.

I'm now looking for a long-term platform for larger investments and weighing Vanguard Digital Advisor vs Vanguard DIY vs Acorns vs Wealthfront. I'm specifically curious about the difference between Vanguard Digital Advisor and Acorns. Based on everything I've read, VDA's portfolio is essentially VTI + VXUS. My Acorns is VOO + IJH (mid cap) + IJR (small cap) + IXUS, which feels very similar, just with VTI broken down into large / mid / small cap. |Vanguard Digital Advisor|Acorns| |:-|:-| |VTI|VOO (big cap)| ||IJH (mid cap)| ||IJR (small cap)| |VXUS|IXUS| Among the options I'm considering, Wealthfront at least has some unique points of differentiation like the HYSA and tax loss harvesting. And Vanguard DIY probably has the most flexibility if I want to tinker in future. # But is picking VDA essentially the same as continuing with Acorns and avoiding the hassle of opening a new account? A lot of my research suggests that Acorns is for micro investing and beginners. And Vanguard or Wealthfront are for more serious, longer-term wealth building.

QQQ,1o8rou6,investing,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"\[Cross-posted to r/ETFs\] I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco. It felt like that scene from Harry Potter where Hogwarts is trying to get in touch with Harry, except instead of being invited to attend a magical wizarding school I'm being told to proxy vote on three proposals for the future of my hard earned muggle money investments. Almost as fun... I truly believe the one big positive from the Gamestop shitstorm was showing a large group of individuals organising and speaking as one makes an impact and can compete with the Goliath institutional investors. Below is more detailed rationale my votes. Proposals #2 and #3 are dependent on Proposal #1 passing (ie: if Proposal #1 to change the classification doesn't pass, the other two proposals don't matter regardless of how folks vote on them). If you voted already, don't worry - you can still amend your vote before October 23. **TLDR: Invesco has the most to gain if Proposal 1 passes while we shareholders have a 2bps fee reduction to gain. I voted ""For"" on Proposal 1, voted individually on Trustees on Proposal 2, and voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 to send a message to Invesco: Come back with a better deal for your shareholders if you want us to sign on. You clearly spent millions on outreaching us, obviously you want this deal. Don't insult us with 2bps chump change.** **Voted ""For"" Proposal 1:** Changing QQQ's classification from a unit investment trust (“UIT”) to an open-end management investment company. Pro: Would reduce fees by 2bps. Con: Like others have already pointed out, why not more? I voted ""**For**"" on this because it would ultimately benefit us. But looking at the other large open-end large ETS their fees range from 3 to 9bps (exception being Russell's IWF at 18bps), so wtf is Invesco doing wasting our time and killing all these trees to come to us with a pitiful 2bps reduction to 18?! Seriously, I almost voted ""Against"" because it's so freaking insulting Invesco blew so much money on this campaign just to treat us like idiots. source from Strategas Research Partners, 09/09/2025: [https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp](https://www.riskbridgeadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/qqq.png.webp) **Voted Individually on Proposal 2:** Electing 9 individual Trustees to replace the current Trustee (a bank). Invesco auto-selected for us to vote ""For"" across the board. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I spent a good chunk of my time investing all the individual trustees to make my own selection. In a capitalist society, money is power and it's about dang time I use my hard earned muggle dollars to make however small an impact I possibly have. Below is how I selected for the Trustees, feel free to DM me for details or even better, research this yourself to make an informed decision: Ronn R. Bagge: Withhold Todd J. Barre: For Brian Hartigan: For Victoria J. Herget: For Marc M. Kole: Withhold Yung Bong Lim: For Joanne Pace: For Gary R. Wicker: For Donald H. Wilson: Against **Voted ""Against"" Proposal 3:** Invesco is proposing to serve as the Trust’s investment adviser. This for me is the kicker, if they want this to happen, come back to us with something better. I think this is how we can send the message ""Naw, don't insult us, work a little harder on this. Show us how much you want it."" I voted ""Against"" for Proposal 3 for all the reasons I explained above. I believe we shareholders can get a lot better deal and this is our chance to achieve it. If we blindly vote ""For"" on all three proposals, we've lost our voice and the Goliaths will have their chance to pull the strings behind the scenes while we get a pathetic 2bps reduction, which will be the **HIGHEST** fee of the large open-end ETFs. *Invesco, do better by your shareholders if you're going to be mailing and calling me EVERY.

VOO,1ocrcqy,Bogleheads,What number do you guys use for the annual interest rate when calculating investment projections for voo?,"I keep seeing conflating average historical return rates ranging from 8%,10%,11.8%, up to 14% and then accounting for different inflation rates of between 1-5% per year. So im just wondering if theres a general consensus I can use to get a realistic number for my projections that isnt OVERLY conservative and definitely not overly optimistic. If the historical average return is truly 11.8% like Ive seen a couple times on here is 8.8% a good number to go by?

SPY,1ocdk6m,wallstreetbets,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard. The Middle East and much of the rest of the world was in turmoil with political tensions, war, and revolution. You may be thinking that my tale sounds like today, but I'm actually talking about the 1979-1980 gold mania, during which the price of gold quadrupled over a single year before culminating in a blow-off top and a >20% drop the next week. **The 1979-1980 Gold Mania:** A wise man once told me history is a flat circle. Here is a chart correlating the current gold price action with the 1979-1980 bubble by the illustrious buccaneer [u/TradeTheBones](https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTheBones/). The correlation is quite good so far. After this point in the 1979-1980 gold mania, the price of gold doubled in 48 trading day (70 days total). [Chart Comparison of 1979-1980 Gold Mania vs 2024-2025 GLD; credit u\/TradeTheBones](https://preview.redd.it/h7d1q29sygwf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bf7f7e9930be850db086d280211b8616b9856) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-5i36w110rgwf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cb330e2487048297809f049e1321f34d7df082a) Now, every cabin boy worth his salt in this casino knows the best way to ride a meme with limited downside: far OTM calls. If gold prices follow this trajectory, here are a couple scenarios for the plunder you could gain from a 16JAN26 GLD 500C option (the farthest OTM currently available) at the current price of 2.14 (market close 20OCT25): **Scenario 1 (1979-1980 Repeat) - GLD doubles to 800 by end of year: Option has $300 of intrinsic value; 14,300% return** **Scenario 2 (Partial Repeat) - GLD increases 50% to 600 by end of year: Option has $100 of intrinsic value; 4,760% return** **Scenario 3 (Continuing trend) - GLD increases 25% to 500 by end of the year: Option has estimated $10 of extrinsic value 2 weeks from expiration; 476% return** **Scenario 4: GLD doesn't increase that much: -100% return** Now, I spy the glint of gold in many of your eyes. But others are muttering among yourselves, “Yet another meme stock. Last time I played one of those, my wife's boyfriend grounded me for a week.“ But here is why gold is uniquely positioned for such a move: gold is a physical object that has served as a trusted store of value for literally all of recorded history. I'll bet almost everyone here has at least one grandparent who hoards precious metals like a geriatric dragon. As a result, many poor souls who've never even heard of meme stocks will plunge into this frothing storm without knowing the perils of speculative markets They don't need charts or a brokerage to buy gold; they just go to their nearest Coin and Jewellery store with their Wendy's paycheck. A second factor today is the sheer access to leverage that did not exist in the 1979's-1980s. Back then, no ETFs even existed. No GLD, no SLV, nothing. And you had to call your broker to place a trade. But today, any room-temperature IQ degenerate can YOLO their entire net worth into 0dte calls on margin at the touch of a button. We just live in an era of rapid and rampant speculation. So now, let me give you a little background on the state of gold in general. If your bored, you can just skip ahead to my positions and exit strategy. **Gold Distribution:** Across the world, there is only 216,000 tons of gold in circulation as of the end of 2024. Approximately half is held as jewelry which includes 34,600 tons and 31,000 tons held by Indian and Chinese households, respectively. Another 38,000 tons is held by central banks. 49,000 tons are held as bars and coins (including ETFs) and finally, 32,000 tons in other uses (industrial, etc). [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/data\/how-much-gold](https://preview.redd.it/ycdnsoy4zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=de8bd50ba2171b41e63e368d5b37bccdfa127bee) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-kw2lzyo7rgwf1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bca613ec3fec7508590af3de870a76c6f4ba61d) Gold Supply: In 2024, 3660 tons of gold was mined which is roughly 1.7% of the total supply. While mining efforts are likely ramping up, this should not impact supply that much over the duration of our voyage. [https:\/\/www.gold.org\/goldhub\/research\/gold-demand-trends\/gold-demand-trends-full-year-2024](https://preview.redd.it/rv3h9wq6zgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4135b0c31f240f3bc13cfb6e5ffdec5b37e7e6) [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-v0te84o9rgwf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bed6835419fbf38ed1d44e180b263493cd0c18d) A greater risk for supply is for people to start selling their gold bullion or jewellery to take advantage of the high prices which is listed as Recycled Gold in the chart above. During 2024, this accounted for 1370 tons, but this will undoubtedly increase as the price of gold increases. In accounts of the 1979-1980 mania, there were suddenly many gold and silver buyers popping up near the end; the modern equivalent would be getting spam texts asking you to sell your silver and gold (like you get for houses currently). This will be a sign the end is near. I will also be monitoring headlines for news of mass retail selling of gold and silver, especially in places like India and China where the population owns a tremendous amount of gold.

The US has been unable to get spending under control and continues to spend like a drunken pirate on shore. While the US is highly unlikely to actually default, the government will print to meet debt requirements, devaluing the currency. If you knew that you would be taking an inflationary haircut on any of your treasury holdings, would you really keep as many? https://preview.redd.it/teqt2yrfzgwf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=605469cc135657a8d1d1e2fe6e2ee445b0180320 Another common talking point driving gold prices is that Central banks are buying lots of gold and several countries, notably Turkey, have laws which gives the central bank the right to buy any gold produced in the country at market prices. Overall, Central Banks bought over 1000 tons of gold in 2023 and 2024. Gold has increased to over 20% of all central bank holdings while US treasuries have fallen. [](https://preview.redd.it/setting-sail-for-plunder-gld-dd-and-yolo-v0-pguftcpirgwf1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=091e2329354eda2c1a6411fdd2836ae24a76fddf) Another more speculative reason for gold rising is high level talks about a BRICS gold-backed currency. This currency would serve as replacement for the US Dollar for trade in a scenario where another hegemonic power did not arise. **Position and Sizing:** As an established pirate, my chest of booty has well over a million doubloons from plundering the land o’ Kohls. If GLD sinks down to Davy Jone’s locker, most of me plunder will remain safe. Don’t be blinded by your greed and wager your whole ship. You should be willing to lose any money that you put on this; but the asymmetry of this play makes it attractive to me.

No one every blew up their account from taking profits. My plan is to take out my cost basis when the position reaches between 4x and 5x value. From there, I plan on selling another tranche every time it doubles: 10x, 20x, 40x, 80x, and 160x. Here are some other exit conditions: \-Gold prices break down from the current trendline. For example, in premarket today, gold dropped 3%. I would say if we close below Friday's low (\~386), that would invalidate the bubble thesis. \-If there are news articles or social media posts about people selling gold en masse THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",393,188,2025-10-21 13:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ocdk6m/setting_sail_for_plunder_gld_dd_and_yolo/,2025-10-29 14:27:45.209642,0.6000000000000001,$SPY,1.0,['GLD'],"['bull', 'calls', 'yolo', 'baghold', 'rally', 'profit', 'loss']",1.0,Broad Market ETF

Ads went limp, Wall Street bailed, and SNAP cratered harder than your mom’s Tinder date. But that’s the reason the stock is sitting at 5-year lows today: **the decline was external, not because the company is fundamentally trash**. 2. **Spectacles = The Real AR Play** – SNAP has been grinding on AR spectacles for a decade. While Zuckbot embarrassed himself with his laugh-track VR demo, SNAP dropped a prototype that actually looks **usable**. Their consumer “Specs” are dropping in 2026, lighter and cheaper than the dev versions. They even built **Snap OS**, a full-blown platform optimized for AR, but you wouldn’t know that because you were too busy watching anime lolis instead of reading investor decks and paying attention to product demos. 3. **8 Billion Daily AR Lenses vs Google’s 14 Billion Searches** – On mobile alone, SNAP’s AR lenses are used **8 billion times a day**. Let me say that again: **8 BILLION WITH a ""B""**. Google search does \~14 billion daily. That means people are snapping AR dogs and anime filters like crazy at HALF THE SCALE OF GOOGLE SEARCH. When Specs launch, SNAP controls **both the hardware and the software**. That means unrestricted ad targeting, a user experience way better than the janky mobile AR crap, and here’s the kicker: they demoed **collaborative AR** between Specs users and mobile users. Imagine shoving ads in both realities at once. That’s a money printer even Papa Powell would respect. I’m early into this play. Specs aren’t out until 2026, but the market is asleep at the wheel. SNAP’s been buying back stock in 2025, cutting costs with layoffs (10% in 2025), and getting their comp structure under control. They’re quietly setting the stage for the next wave while you guys YOLO weekly SPY puts like brain-damaged chimps. Now, I’ll keep it real with you: * Competition exists. But except for Meta, **Google and Apple don’t have social platforms** to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical. * Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things. * User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue. * CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times. **Bottom line:** SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits. **Position:** 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks.",340,230,2025-10-02 00:53:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nvpvso/snap_the_only_specs_that_matter/,2025-10-29 14:27:45.215769,0.55,$SPY,1.0,['SNAP'],"['bull', 'puts', 'moon', 'yolo', 'revenue']",0.9285714285714285,Broad Market ETF

Comfortable with volatility but concerned about concentration. **Current positions (total: $85.7k NZD / \~$49k USD):** * TSLA: 29.6% ($25.3k) - +102% return * RKLB: 28.7% ($24.6k) - +432% return * NVDA: 14.5% ($12.4k) - +61% return * VOO: 10.6% ($9.1k) - +35% return * AMZN: 7.4% ($6.4k) - +49% return * SHOP: 5.4% ($4.6k) - +165% return * IBIT: 1.2% ($1.0k) - +26% return * SMCI: 0.9% ($785) - -13% return * OPEN: 0.6% ($498) - +186% return (but all analysts rate it sell) * LLY: 0.5% ($451) - -13% return * NIO: 0.5% ($414) - -34% return **Key concerns:** 1. 58% concentrated in just two stocks (TSLA + RKLB) - both have been huge winners but feeling exposed 2. Approaching NZ's $50k foreign investment tax threshold (based on cost basis) where I'll owe annual tax on 5% of portfolio value regardless of gains 3. Planning to DCA $10k NZD (\~$5.7k USD) per year going forward **Questions:** * Should I trim TSLA/RKLB back to 10% each and diversify, or let winners run? * Should I use some of those trimmings to get VOO to at least 30% for safety? * Any specific sectors or stocks you'd recommend adding for better balance? * Should I be thinking about the NZ tax threshold differently?

VOO,1oapx46,Bogleheads,VT and chill...right?,"Hi all, thanks for stopping by my post. I've been lurking this sub for a while and I never really had the money to make significant investments, but my situation changed and I want to set myself up for the future. I'm 24M living at home with my parents, no expenses besides gas/insurance, leisure, and additional food outside of what's cooked for dinner. I got hired at the post office so I left my old job, and was recently able to over my old employee sponsored 401k plan into a Roth IRA (my reasoning being that I'm in a low tax bracket and I'd know exactly how much I could pull out once the time comes). I don't come from much financial knowledge or success, I grew up and still live in a HCOL area (Long Island, NY) and I've seen what my parents have had to do to keep food on the table and while I greatly appreciate it, I don't want to put myself through the same type of stress. My first question is: What should I invest my IRA holdings in for the most amount of growth over the long term? From what I've learned, I'm assuming I can just buy all VT just to set it and forget it for a while as i continue to contribute, then down the line diversify my contributions for more stability. My goal is to retire as early as possible, and the fastest way to do that seems to be getting your money to work for you as much as possible. Since starting my new job, I cleared all my credit card debt and have a plan to pay off my student loans by the end of 2026. After that I don't have any debt and don't plan to incur any until I can start considering buying a house hopefully in the next 10 years. I buy my cars off Marketplace in cash so no worries about payments, pay my insurance policy in full so that it's a one time expense, and I've been adjusting my lifestyle to significantly cut down on leisurely spending and focus on investing in my future. My Roth has about $9k after the rollover, but most of it has been sitting uninvested the last couple days due to me not wanting to make a costly wrong decision or accidentally set myself back. Outside of my IRAs I've bought $1k in both VOO and VTI so that I'd at least be making something while I mull over the decision, any and all advice is greatly appreciated so thank you guys in advance!",22,18,2025-10-19 13:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oapx46/vt_and_chillright/,2025-10-29 14:26:07.171545,0.5,$VOO,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999,Broad Market ETF

International is finally up YTD over US, and all I see is VT and chill, or 60/40 split. It used to be all VOO or VTI. And now gold? Are you serious? Any legitimate investor isn’t buying something that “might” be worth more later, yet isn’t producing anything of value. Meanwhile the VTI and chill crowd is up 15% YTD, after two consecutive 20%+ years. I have no qualms with an international hedge, if you believe in that, and ignore currency risks/fluctuations. But this new sentiment is truly fun to watch. I can’t wait until the next down trend when Gold and International provide literally no safety. I’ll continue buying VTI and FSKAX on schedule per usual. Also, has anyone actually read the books written by the namesake of this group? He listed plenty of reasons why he doesn’t believe international is necessary, and none of them have to do with “recency bias” or “performance chasing”.

Personally, I lean in the Boglehead direction, but I'd really like to expand my knowledge and get a better idea of the overall pros and cons of both sides. I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications. On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times. That's about the extent of my knowledge though.

VOO,1odxsfc,Bogleheads,I lost almost all because I am dumb,"Hello Guys, Today I want to tell you one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Usually I am very careful with my money and have been almost entirely invested in ETFs. Some time ago I pulled all my money from ETFs because I feared the market would crash (I know timing the market usually doesn't work). Then yesterday for whatever reason my brain stopped working and I put almost everything I had in to BYND. Unfortunately I had a very high buy in price and now realized my losses, which amount to over 45k$. I lost half my money on this incredibly stupid mistake and I really hope, that I have learned for life. Currently I am 27 years old soon to be 28 and making about 100k gross a year. Around 4k net a month but have to pay 1k for rent. What should I do with the money that I have left? I know usually the answer is ETFs but I really really think some correction must be coming soon. Usually I would probably just buy VOO or All world ETF for 70-80% of my portfolio, keep around 15% to invest in to individual stocks and about 5% for crypto or some kind of ""gambling""!

The caveat being, of course, that no one had something like NVDA in their top 10 in 2015 but many of the other companies have been mainstays for >5 years. So you would have to occasionally rearrange your portfolio to accommodate the top 10 for your preferred investing style, but likely not by much. The second thing I found interesting was [how ""dividend-focused"" ETFs performed ](https://imgur.com/a/DQwfR36)relative to those that are tracking specific indices or sectors. Despite having large holdings in ""growth"" companies that offer very low dividends, too. I think this reaffirmed my choice to use SCHD to hedge against market downturns but if I were 100% growth focused I wouldn't use that one either. I debate the strengths and weaknesses of dividend focused investing routinely, but I think the conclusion is that by the very nature of offering large dividends those companies are going to be growing more slowly. However, by common sense and the data, those companies tend to also be more stable during market corrections. So if you lean bearish then higher investment in those types of companies (not necessarily the ETFs) could still play to your favor. Anyway, all critiques are welcome and if you can provide experience or data that contradicts my assumptions or highlights important points that I missed then please do. (Side note: the data I used for the ETF vs stock direct comparison was the actual historical data, not an attempt at future projection as on the other sheets.)",0,22,2025-10-05 17:35:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nyuk3i/did_the_math_on_etf_vs_individual_stock_investing/,2025-10-29 14:26:54.568937,0.45,$SPY,0.8,[],"['bear', 'dividend']",0.7114285714285714,Broad Market ETF

VOO,1obz0sw,Bogleheads,Need advice on investments with my advisor,"Hello! Throw away account for anonymity. Sort of a long story but here it goes. I have been saving/investing for about 18 years mainly focusing on my employer's 401k program. About two years ago, I switched jobs and had to decide what to do with my 401k, if anything. I have had a financial advisor pretty much the whole time whom I have been paying a flat fee per year (completely worth it in my case imo). To give a bit of pertinent info, the advisor is also a close friend whom I trust and is a CFP. When asked what shall I do with my 401k, he took his time and was going back and forth whether I should just leave it or roll it into my new job's 401k program. We also discussed opening an IRA with his company (a large and relatively well known wealth management company). He wasn't pushing me either way, just laying out info and options. Although I had been saving and investing, I really didn't know much as far as finances go so I was hoping for guidance on this decision. We ended up opening an IRA with about 80% of the old 401k and put the rest into the 401k with my new job(target date fund). Again, he is a close friend whom I have trusted. He said it would be an actively managed account and he would charge me the lowest fee he could which is 0.5%. I have learned this is actually pretty good as far as AUM fees go (I realize this is highly debatable) but I was comfortable with this as I trust him. Fast forward 2 years later and here we are. I have been really digging deep (at least to me lol) to learn as much as I could about investing and finance. I also have since realized I would like to retire as soon as is feasible, which likely will not be for at least about 10 years, more likely 15. But what I have learned is that it is extremely hard to beat returns on an index fund such as VOO and others. And on top of that, the fees are much better (my 401k has a fee of 0.08%). I know that there are different risk levels and that will determine returns as well. I have always been a moderately aggressive to aggressive investor based on his firm's terminology. The IRA currently is 80% equity, 12.5% fixed income, 5% alternative and 2.5% cash. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples to my 401K to see if I made the right choice as I suspect I may not have. The **401K rate of return is: 17.27% ytd and 15.02% for just the year 2024**. I used these timeframes as the account has only been open about 2 years and when I tried asking for the return rate for 1/1/24-10/19/25 it said 35.2% which didn't seem right. The **IRA rate of return is: 13.38% ytd and 11.98% for 2024**. This is before fees I assume so take off another 0.5% plus fees for the various funds (the portfolio has no less than 25 positions). I would like to stick with him at least as far as the flat fee annual financial planning and guidance goes but I am having second thoughts on the investments. So my questions are: 1. Does this look like a fair comparison? 2. If so, is it a good idea to leave these investments in the IRA? I am not looking forward to the conversation of taking out my funds but I definitely will if I determine it is in the best interest for me and my family.

I opened a HYSA with Sofi and depositing 1k into the savings account every paycheck, and I plan on maximizing my Roth IRA on the 2nd of every January. Currently, I'm trying to solve a problem of consolidating all my retirement plans from all my employers. I have two accounts (4 accounts in total) in both Vanguard and Fidelity. Fidelity: $9,286.88 in a Simple IRA with positions FBALX and FSANX $16,758.33 in a Fidelity Freedom 2050 K6 (FZTKX) Vanguard: $4,025.68 in a Roth IRA with VFFVX $12,419.84 in a 401(k) Target Retire 2055 Trust I still need to hunt down a few other employers, but I have another 401(k) with my current employer and about $6,000 in a 403(b) from my previous employer. At least for the Fidelity and Vanguard accounts, what would you rollover and which ones would you keep? I would like to keep things simple, and I don't mind paying rollover fees. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Update 10/27/2025 Thanks everyone. I ended up keeping both Vanguard and Fidelity. I have a rollover IRA and a Roth IRA in both brokerage firms. The rollover IRAs will stay there with pre-tax dollars for current and future 401(k) accounts even though the backdoor method was mentioned to put the funds into the Roth IRAs. I like having the flexibility of a Roth IRA in both brokerage firms to change funds for performance chasing and diversity. All the amounts in Vanguard investment were changed to VGT. I will keep an eye on the market and switch to VOO if the IT sector becomes too risky. I would like to say that Fidelity's customer service was definitely better. I do like that that switching between Fidelity funds is easy. Vanguard wanted to charge me $25 dollars to switch funds and didn't mention any benefit to staying with Vanguard funds within Vanguard. Anyways, the amounts in Fidelity were split 50/50 into two funds: FSPSX and FMDGX. I like the growth and diversification of my choices. I will decide how I will be contributing the $7,000 at the beginning of every year between all 3 funds, but I am keeping an eye on opportunities within the small caps market. My current employer's 401(k) portal is simple to use, and I can quickly increase contributions towards the end of the year. I didn't have a lot of investment options for my 401(k), but I did change it to FXAIX.

VOO,1o1tlzd,Bogleheads,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability. But that aside, why would someone choose broad based funds like VTI or VOO over more focused options like SP100 or SCHG? Edit: Thanks everyone! I really enjoyed reading your thoughts on investing and life. It’s super interesting and refreshing to hear different perspectives.

VOO,1nx45ob,stocks,Newish investor - should I worry?,"Was skimming through the CNBC news app and read this fear mongering article (can’t post attachments so will copy paste some parts): - “With S&P 500 near record highs, it's time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget it strategy, some experts say Even amid a federal government shutdown, the S&P 500 climbed to a new all-time high on Thursday. Yet investors who double down on that index risk overconcentration in big company names. Here's how experts say to diversify to avoid those risks: Experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500-focused strategy, famously touted by legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""The S&P 500 is broken,"" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner. Many investors assume investing in the S&P 500 index through ETF tickers SPY, VOO or IVV is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said. If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur. But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%. Wall Street forecasts generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future. Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback. Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies. Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks. That’s mostly all of it. I do want to set and forget it, I have about $27.k into the U.S ETF index and Canadian index split evenly. I’m up pretty good. Now sits at 30.8k.

VOO,1o2vqw3,Bogleheads,Semi-beginner investor looking for tips,"Hi all, just turned 33 and trying to get a handle on investing, even if its a bit late. I have a long standing money market and roth ira account with Edward Jones but the more control I have with vanguard and fidelity is appealing. Recently created a roth on fidelity and playing with which etfs to include. currently have about $100 in it, 20% SCHD and QQQI/SPMO/SPYI/VT at 10% each with 40% left in unallocated funds, based on investor youtube videos. My question is twofold. My EJ Roth has a return rate (since inception in 2021) of about 11%. It has averaged 20% per year except for 2022 which was -20%, i assume a covid related crash. Problem is that most portfolios I find in videos average about 7% per year. Much less than the 11% EJ seems to be giving me. Im tempted to switch but if the difference really is that drastic it makes more financial sense to stay with them. Is it normal to have such wide variance with returns, and a much higher average return at that? Second: I am interested in upping my liquid investments as well, but I want to do so in a way that minimizes my taxes. I currently have about 40k with FNILX but thinking about switching to VOO for the portability.

However, I'm unsure if my portfolio is on the right path for me to retire comfortably (probably aged 65). I'm in my early 30s and just started investing for retirement outside of my employer (pension) this year, so I'm feeling pretty scared and anxious for my future!

I'll try to put at least $7k into the 457(b) and will continue contributing to my emergency fund and/or brokerage with any leftover money. I want to be a lazy/passive investor, but I want growth since I started late, so my risk tolerance is high. With that said, is there anything I should change in my portfolio to get the most growth?

Let's say a person has $25,000 usd in a Roth 401k and that money is in an ETF like VOO. There are no other assets such as real estate, gold or crypto.

Potentially change to foreign assets or something idk, something that would lessen the impact. I understand markets will go up and down, but is there a way to reduce the impact from a crash? From my understanding the roth 401k could not be changed to assets like gold easily. One could roll the 401k into a self-directed Gold IRA account that allows for gold investment.

I put all of my money into SPY and VTI, both of which have nearly doubled in the past 5 years. However, from speaking to my parents, it sounds like their money has not doubled in that timeframe (or anything close to that really). When I mentioned that VTI had nearly 7x'd since 2000, they seemed very surprised. My father mentioned that he has indicated to their manager that he prefers aggressive investments, and that every team he meets with the 'money manager' this person says they're 'beating the baseline'. My first reaction was that this seems negligent on the part of the money manager, or, at the very least that we should consider ditching them and just investing in SPY/VTI. I'm very confused what the 'baseline' could be other than SPY/VTI that they're consistently beating (but still only up 20 or 30% in the past 5 years). Am I missing something?

QQQ,1nuowqp,Bogleheads,Suggestions Welcomed,"Hello everyone, Long time lurker first time poster (not using my main account). I am a 45F who is trying to make some strategic moves in preparation for potential life changes due to life events, the economy and my desire to get out of the rat race. At this time my financial life looks like this; 65k - Maxing my current employers’ 401k with 10% monthly contributions + 10% match. Additional 6% contribution post tax 5% pretax employee stock purchase program of QQQ about 14k worth for a year. 200k Traditional IRA currently split 30% VT, 10% VXUS, 20% SGOV, 10% IBTI & 10% NVDIA 131k Brokerage with 80% SGOV 20%, 10% VT & 10% VXUS. I plan to DCA 100k into VT in October. 300k in a HYSA at 4.30 Which I am in the process of moving to my brokerage to DCA another 100k into VT and will leave 200k liquid as my emergency fund. I know I am too cash heavy, but I am a single mom with sole custody who won’t be an empty nester for another 3 years and who will have to pay for my daughter’s college (100k already allocated for that and not included above). Right now I am trying to build a plan where I can live off my emergency funds and compound interest should I end up unemployed in 2026. I have reduced my expenses considerably and expect them to be no more than 4k a month in total (mortgage, insurance, utilities, medical co-pays, house maintenance, gas, food, etc). I live and breathe by a budget and am extremely frugal which is the only reason why I have been able to build a safety net, but I want to ensure I can grow through investing so that my hard earned cash yields higher than it has seating on my HYSA while also getting more tax advantages. I say this to say, I don’t want to continue the corporate rat race and given how messed up our economy is, I am trying to have a contingency plan to not have to take on a shitier, less paying job if the tiff comes for me in the spring and actually take the much needed break my very burnt out brain needs. Having said the above I would like your opinions on my plan to maintain 230k cash on hand in SGOV (instead of the HYSA) to draw from if I get riffed. I calculated that if I need 4k a month starting the spring of 2026 and yields stay at current rate, that’s about 6 years and if they go down to let’s say 3% that’s about 6 years if I add unemployment and severance. In 5 years I would be an empty nester and will like to move out of the country where I could live on 1k a month and basically cruise until I can use the rule of 55 to start cashing in on my portfolio. I know you all don’t have a crystal ball and no one knows what will happen to the market in the future but I am basically trying to not lose 50% of my liquid as I am burned out from working my whole life to raise my kids on my own and want to protect myself against a potential 30-50% downturn in the event I lose my job (tech sector) in the next year. I am a high performer and am not currently at risk but my org is weird and they recently riffed my boss who was an amazing professional and leader so I am wary and don’t want to find myself unemployed and burning through my reserves without a plan. God willing and I am able to stay, my plan is to up my 6% post tax contribution to 10% and add it to my brokerage in form of DCA into VT/VXUS. Let me have your thoughts and please be gentle, I am not as well informed as most of you and was only able to start making meaningful contributions to my retirement and brokerage the past two years.",2,4,2025-09-30 20:52:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nuowqp/suggestions_welcomed/,2025-10-29 14:28:20.112890,0.4,QQQ,0.5,[],['split'],0.6057142857142856,Technology ETF

VOO,1ohkt5a,Bogleheads,22-year-old soon-to-be nurse looking to start my financial journey — where should I begin?,"Hey everyone, I’m 22 and will be graduating from nursing school this December. I’ll be starting my first RN job soon, and I really want to make sure I use my money wisely from the start. I’ve been reading a little about investing and really like the idea of keeping things simple and focusing on long-term growth. I’m willing to dive deep into things and study if it is required. That said, I’m still very new to all of this and not sure where to begin. My goals are to: • Learn how to invest responsibly • Understand retirement accounts (401k, Roth IRA, etc.) • Build good financial habits early • Set myself up for long-term financial independence Right now, I use Robinhood (with only a few hundred dollars invested in VOO and SFY), but I’m wondering if I should switch to something else before I really start investing seriously… maybe Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab? I’d love to hear your thoughts on that. If anyone has recommendations for: • Beginner-friendly books, YouTube channels, or podcasts • What order I should learn things in • How to approach investing as a new grad nurse with a modest starting income …I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance for any advice.
