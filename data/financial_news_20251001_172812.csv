Gold Market In-Depth Analysis  for FOREXCOM:XAUUSD by Gold-Pulse,"Gold Market In-Depth Analysis | Driven by risk aversion and expectations of rate cuts, gold prices aim for $4,000 🚀 Core Market Overview 📈 Spot gold continued its strong performance on Wednesday (October 1st), hitting a new all-time high near $3,900 and holding steady around $3,890 during the European session. Since the beginning of 2025, the price has risen by over 45%, with double-digit gains in September alone, demonstrating a rare upward trend in recent years. 💹 Fundamentals in-depth Analysis 🔍 1. 🛡️ Safe-haven demand continues to build Geopolitical risks: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has escalated again, and tensions remain high in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. US Government Shutdown Crisis: The Republican spending bill has stalled in the Senate, raising the risk of a partial government shutdown in early October. Historical data shows that shutdowns last an average of eight days (with a maximum of 35 days). If the deadlock persists, it will drag down GDP and dampen business investment. 2. 💰 Monetary Policy Expectations Support High Probability of Rate Cuts: CME interest rate futures indicate a near 95% probability of an October rate cut and over 75% probability of another December rate cut. Economic Data Signals: JOLTS job vacancies fell to 7.22 million (below expectations), initial jobless claims rose, and signs of a slowing labor market reinforce the case for easing. US Dollar and Interest Rate Environment: The US dollar index fell below key moving averages for four consecutive days, while long-term real interest rates remained low, reducing the cost of holding gold. 3. 🏦 Solid Structural Buying Central bank gold purchases and ETF inflows provide underlying support. Market concerns about US Treasury risks and inflationary stickiness are driving continued allocations to gold. Technical analysis from multiple dimensions 📊 1. Trend structure ↗️ The daily line is running strongly along the upper track of the Bollinger Band, forming a standard rising channel (upper track 3906/middle track 3647/lower track 3389); The previous key pressure of 3750 turned into support after breaking through, becoming the primary line of defense for short-term correction. 2. Indicator signal 🎯 MACD: The fast and slow lines maintain a golden cross (98.15/86.69), but the narrowing of the bar indicates weakening momentum; RSI (14): The reading of 82.41 enters the severe overbought zone, and short-term adjustment pressure accumulates; Bollinger Band: The sharp expansion of the bandwidth reflects the surge in volatility. The price is far away from the middle track and needs to be vigilant of technical repair. 3. Key Levels 🎚️ Resistance: 3906 (Upper Bollinger Band) → 3945 (Fibonacci Extension) → 4000 (Psychological Level); Support: 3750 (Breakout Conversion Level) → 3647 (Middle Bollinger Band) → 3389 (Lower Bollinger Band). Market Sentiment and Capital Flows 🌊 Sentiment Indicators: The Fear and Greed Index indicates the market is in ""greed"" territory, while rising option implied volatility reflects surging hedging demand. 😰➡️😎 Capital Flows: Quantitative strategies are triggering trend-following buying, but high volume suggests a growing divergence between bulls and bears. Risk Warning: Any negative data (such as a strong jobs report or geopolitical easing) within the extremely overbought market could trigger profit-taking. ⚠️ Market Outlook and Strategic Recommendations 🧭 1. Scenario Analysis 🔮 Upside Breakout: If it holds above 3906, the subsequent target is the 3945-4020 area. 🚀 Technical Pullback: If the 3750 support level falls, a test of the 3647 mid-range is possible. A deeper pullback requires attention to the 3389 support level. 📉 2. Trading Strategy ⚔️ Trend Following: Long positions on pullbacks remain the primary strategy until the bullish trend is broken, with a focus on the validity of the 3750 support level. Risk Management Tips: Set strict stop-loss orders and be wary of the risk of a resonant pullback caused by an overbought RSI and a top divergence in the MACD. 🛡️ Summary 💎 Gold remains strong, driven by a triple threat of safe-haven demand, expectations of rate cuts, and a weakening US dollar. However, technical overbought signals suggest the possibility of increased short-term volatility. Investors are advised to pay attention to key data such as non-farm payrolls and CPI, while seizing opportunities for phased layout in structural market conditions, and always put risk control first! ⚡",TradingView,2025-10-01T09:15:25Z,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/hphaU3J0-Gold-Market-In-Depth-Analysis/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.656302,-0.207843137254902
How To Recycle Used Motor Oil - Jalopnik,"Performing an oil change can be extremely enjoyable -- watching that used sludge drain out and replacing it with clean amber liquid can even help you feel more connected to the engine. However, many people wonder what to do with the used oil once they finish, and since your oil pan only holds so many quarts, you'll have to deal with it eventually. Fortunately, there are several places you can take the used oil to ensure that it's recycled properly, most of which offer this service free of charge. As for what happens to the used motor oil next, it goes through a detox process to remove water, debris, and other impurities, before undergoing re-refining process for future use. So, who will take used engine oil? Many automotive parts retailers, like Advance Auto Parts, O'Reilly Auto Parts, Pep Boys Auto, and AutoZone, to name a few, will accept used oil and other vehicle fluids. Select car dealers may accept used motor oil, and your local county or city may also offer collection at designated facilities or even through door-to-door pickup programs. One of the best resources you can utilize is the search function at Earth911, which allows you to enter the material you wish to recycle, like motor oil, and input your zip code for a robust list of local options. The listings include retailers, as well as local programs, and the tool can also provide extra information, such as how much oil these locations will accept.",Jalopnik,2025-10-01T09:25:00Z,https://www.jalopnik.com/1979801/how-to-recycle-used-motor-oil/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.656701,0.4431372549019608
AsiaOne,"HANOI -- Vietnam's government said Typhoon Bualoi caused an estimated eight trillion dong (S$390 million) of property damage this week, saying in a preliminary assessment on Wednesday (Oct 1) that nearly 170,000 houses were damaged or inundated by flooding. Bualoi made landfall on Monday in northern central Vietnam, bringing huge sea swells, strong winds and heavy rains that have killed at least 29 people and left 22 others missing, according to the disaster management agency report. The typhoon severely damaged roads, schools, and offices, and caused power grid failures that left tens of thousands of families without electricity, the report said. More than 34,000 hectares of rice and other crops were destroyed, it said. The report did not mention any major damage to industrial properties. Vietnam is a regional manufacturing hub, and large factories in or near the typhoon's path included some owned by Foxconn, Formosa Plastics, Luxshare and Vinfast. The typhoon triggered floods across Vietnam's north, and disrupted flights and train services with the capital, Hanoi, where schools were closed and many homes inundated. With a long coastline facing the South China Sea, Vietnam is prone to typhoons that are often deadly. Last year, Typhoon Yagi killed around 300 people and caused damages estimated at US$3.3 billion (S$4.25 billion) across northern Vietnam.",AsiaOne,2025-10-01T09:25:36Z,https://www.asiaone.com/asia/vietnam-estimates-property-damage-typhoon-bualoi-390m,2025-10-01 17:26:52.657067,-0.4588235294117647
$1B casino resort near South Carolina border expected to bring new growth to region,"KINGS MOUNTAIN, N.C. -- A new $1 billion casino being constructed along Interstate 85 is expected to draw additional growth to surrounding areas. The Catawba Two Kings Casino Resort site is 35 miles from Charlotte -- and just 5 miles up I-85 from the state's border with South Carolina, where casinos aren't allowed. The spread will include a 24-story, 385-room hotel. Built on a 17-acre site, the casino will open in phases, with an introductory opening in spring 2026 with 1,350 slot machines, 20 game tables, a 40-seat restaurant, a bar and sports betting kiosks. The new space will replace the current temporary offering that's been on site since July 2021. In 2027, the main casino complex is scheduled to open. The main development will include 4,300 slot machines, 100 table games, 11 dining outlets, a players' lounge, 11 bars, a parking garage with 2,700 spaces and a parking lot with 800 spaces. The casino is expected to employ more than 2,000 workers once it opens. The hotel will be connected to the gambling area once it's completed. Over the past 12 months, foundations for the casino complex and hotel have been completed. Steel continues to be added to the hotel tower on site. The project is being led by the Catawba Nation Gaming Authority. Kings Mountain City Manager Todd Carpenter expects the new casino to bring growth to the area. So far, there's no other new development happening off Exit 5 near where the site is located. That's expected to change. ""We are expecting development but haven't seen it happen yet,"" Carpenter said. ""We are trying to plan for the influx of people and will do what we can to attract folks in terms of hotels, restaurants and entertainment. We hope to attract people to downtown and in other areas of Kings Mountain."" Kings Mountain, a small city in both Cleveland and Gaston counties, is considered a suburb of Charlotte. Carpenter told The Post and Courier the city had already experienced some growth prior to the casino's plans to expand. ""There are a ton of workers at the site right now,"" Carpenter said of the casino's construction site. In Cherokee County, it's still too soon to know what impact the development will have on the area's economy. Ken Moon, the Cherokee County Development Board's executive director, said businesses located off exits near the site will initially reap the benefits of having more people traveling here for entertainment. ""I think it will have a big impact on our exits with cars coming back and forth,"" Moon said. ""There's going to be construction of other hotels up there from what I understand."" Moon suggested families at the casino may want to take day trips to other locations while there including destinations in Gaffney. On a recent trip to the construction site, Moon said work continues to progress and there's continued interest in the temporary casino. ""There was like over 1,000 people in those buildings (temporary casino),"" Moon said. ""I think as time goes by people will have interest in doing more things in Kings Mountain and Cherokee County."" As part of the construction, the size of Dixon School Road Bridge over I-85 near the site entrance was doubled, and new sewer lines were installed near the site. ""The casino resort will be an economic game changer for Catawba citizens and a force to drive the economy of Cleveland County and the City of Kings Mountain,"" Catawba Nation Chief Brian Harris said in a statement. ""This project is a testament to our resilience, our commitment to self-sufficiency, and our determination to build a better future for ourselves and our future generations.""",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/spartanburg/business/catawba-two-kings-casino-resort-kings-mountain-nc/article_871a828e-c6af-4469-ae3c-b90a406cb883.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.657817,0.03529411764705892
"Weekly cattle intake tops 30,000 head for first time since April","For the first time since April, the weekly intake at factories exceeded 30,000 head last week, while supply remains about 75% compared with the same week in 2024. Weekly supply continues to be almost 10,000 head less than a year ago. Improved weather during the second half of September helped finishers hold on to stock, as better ground conditions meant the expected surge in factory supply did not materialise. Finishers are reporting factories showing ""a bit more interest"" in cattle this week, which is being described as a positive for the trade outlook. Speculation in recent weeks was that the decline in factory quotes would bottom out at 700c/kg, and as of this week, prices have settled on a base a shade stronger than that -- welcome news for producers. Most factories are quoting a base of 710c/kg for steers, with deals up to 720c/kg being negotiated. Agents have been described as ""a bit more anxious to get the cattle"" than in recent weeks. The general base quote for heifers is 720c/kg, with a good percentage of sellers reporting 730c/kg being paid, particularly to those with larger numbers. One supplier summed up the mood: ""There is definitely less of the 'that's it, take it or leave it' attitude by the factories this week as they seem more anxious to get the cattle, even if they have to give a few extra cents to secure them, which is all positive for finishers."" Trade has firmed across all categories this week, with prices more stable. There is good demand for cows, with 690-700c/kg being paid for R-grade cows. Prices for young bulls are close to the equivalent grade steer at 720-725c/kg for R-grade. Supply last week was 30,053 head, compared with 39,854 head the same week last year. Year-to-date intake up to last week came to 1,215,819 head, compared with 1,323,819 for the same period in 2024. Supply last week included 13,897 steers, 8,821 heifers, 5,825 cows and 1,060 young bulls, with all categories substantially lower than last year. Steers were down 5,000 head on 2024 levels.",Irish Examiner,2025-10-01T09:25:28Z,https://www.irishexaminer.com/farming/arid-41715492.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.658224,0.3411764705882352
African industries face shock as Trump brings end to AGOA,"African apparel and textile manufacturers will be the hardest hit by the end of the US tariff-free trade scheme. Africa's apparel and textile manufacturers - already reeling from US tariffs - will be hardest hit by the end of the US's tariff-free African Growth and Opportunity Act, according to research by the International Trade Center (ITC). AGOA, which has provided dozens of African countries with tariff-free access to the US market since it was signed into US law in 2000, was allowed to lapse on September 30 by the Trump administration, bringing an end to preferences for 32 countries, of whom 22 qualified for apparel provisions. Across all sectors, tariff measures introduced in 2025 are estimated to reduce projected exports of AGOA beneficiaries by about 8% by 2029. The expiry of AGOA adds a further decline of 0.6 percentage points, or $189m. $138m of that will be accounted for by reductions in exports of apparel and textile products to the United States, which are expected to register a decline of 9.7% by 2029 as a result of the end of AGOA, by far the greatest impact on any sector. Skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (-3.3%), processed food and animal feed (-1.6%) and vehicles (-1.3%) are the next most affected. The ITC says the expiry of AGOA will increase duties in value-added and labour-intensive sectors that had benefited most from preferential access. The steepest hikes are observed in apparel & textile products (+14 percentage points), skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (+4.3) and processed food & animal feed (+2.4), where competitiveness has relied heavily on duty-free entry under AGOA. In recent months, the administration has hit African and non-African countries with tariffs, further exacerbating the impact of the end of AGOA. For the apparel industry, the 14 percentage point increase from the end of AGOA combined with the 13 percentage point increase from 2025 tariffs leads to a total tariff increase of 27 percentage points. AGOA contained special provisions for textiles and apparel, including the ""third-country fabric allowance."" This rule, available only to ""least developed"" countries approved for apparel eligibility, allowed them to source fabric globally while still exporting finished apparel duty-free to the United States. It was instrumental in enabling countries such as Lesotho, Kenya and Madagascar to establish competitive apparel industries. More advanced economies such as South Africa and Mauritius, while granted apparel eligibility, did not benefit from the third-country fabric allowance and were subject to stricter rules of origin requiring fabric sourced from the United States or other AGOA beneficiaries. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the ITC, said the end of AGOA and the introduction of US tariffs could have a devastating impact on apparel exporters. ""If AGOA were to lapse, it will deal a blow to African countries already feeling the weight of new trade measures, from the latest tariffs to sustainability requirements. Access to key markets is becoming more difficult, and African countries - especially the least developed - are feeling the strain. Take Lesotho. Nearly 60% of its apparel exports go to the US, worth over $230m annually. Under AGOA, those goods entered the US market duty-free. Today, they face a 15% tariff. That may sound small, compared with the initial 50%, but this move has led to cancelled orders, lost jobs and reduced competitiveness vis-à-vis neighbours like Kenya and Eswatini, which face a 10% rate. Lesotho's textile industry employs 40,000 people. This is affecting real people, real lives.""",African Business,2025-10-01T09:22:13Z,https://african.business/2025/10/trade-investment/african-industries-face-shock-as-trump-brings-end-to-agoa,2025-10-01 17:26:52.658950,0.2156862745098038
South Africa's graduates and the entrepreneurial crossroads | The Citizen,"Youth unemployment hovers at crisis levels, and many graduates struggle to find stable work in South Africa. Entrepreneurship, often touted as a remedy, is still seen by many as a last resort rather than a viable career path. The result is a paradox: at a time when the economy urgently needs new ventures, the very people best positioned to create them hesitate to take the leap. ""The socio-economic barriers are real,"" says Martin Manmohan of the bhive Enterprise Development Centre at North-West University (NWU). ""Many of our young graduates lack personal savings or collateral to secure loans. Venture capital and angel investment ecosystems are still developing and often favour experienced entrepreneurs, rather than side-hustles and start-ups. With limited job opportunities, graduates tend to prioritise stable employment over risky entrepreneurial ventures."" Manmohan argues that universities must take a more active role in reshaping this dynamic. ""We should establish an enterprise development fund to support emerging businesses,"" he suggests. ""Alongside funding, we must provide non-financial services such as business plans, financial projections and mentoring. Our final-year and master's students in accounting and business can contribute directly to these efforts."" Money is only one part of the puzzle. Equally vital are networks, which many graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds lack. ""Graduates may not have access to mentors, industry contacts or professional networks. This isolation hinders idea validation, partnerships and market access,"" Manmohan explains. To address this, NWU convenes networking sessions that connect students with industry partners, government agencies and organisations such as the SAB Foundation, Black Umbrellas and the National Youth Development Agency. Universities themselves are implicated. ""While we teach theory well, many institutions lack practical entrepreneurship training, such as financial literacy, business planning and digital marketing,"" says Manmohan. ""We also need to support students with soft skills like negotiation, leadership and resilience, which are often underdeveloped."" Bureaucratic obstacles add another layer, as red tape and compliance rules discourage many would-be founders before they begin. Cultural expectations can be just as powerful. Families often push graduates towards ""safe"" careers, while others see entrepreneurship as unstable or unsuitable, particularly in poorer communities. ""Most of our students lack confidence, or in some cases, they're overconfident. Both need careful guidance,"" says Manmohan. ""Fear of the unknown also holds many back, as they simply have little exposure to entrepreneurship."" Manmohan insists that resilience and leadership training must form a core part of entrepreneurship education. ""We already offer experiential modules, bootcamps and mentorship programmes. Students can role-play leadership situations, engage in peer-led resilience circles, and take part in 'fail-forward' workshops where failure is treated as a learning opportunity,"" he says. ""But participation is low, because entrepreneurship is not yet seen as a key activity by students."" He believes storytelling has a role. ""Most South African entrepreneurs start with little or no capital. Take Theo Baloyi, who built Bathu from scratch, or Soweto's Nokuthla Tshabalala, who began collecting waste by hand and now employs 12 people through her company Trash2Treasure. These stories prove that resilience and vision can overcome extraordinary odds. Students need to see these examples and realise entrepreneurship is possible."" For Manmohan, the missing piece is partnership. ""Real-world exposure, access to resources and infrastructure, industry mentorship and coaching, seed funding, skills transfer, market validation -- these are what make the difference,"" he argues. ""Universities cannot nurture entrepreneurs in a vacuum. Collaborations with incubators, local businesses and government ensure that student ventures align with community needs and promote inclusive growth."" The task, he believes, is urgent. If South Africa is to reduce youth unemployment, diversify its economy and unlock growth, it must reframe entrepreneurship from a fallback option to a first choice. That requires systemic support, including funding mechanisms, network-building, practical training, and, above all, a cultural shift that rewards resilience and innovation. ""Entrepreneurship builds discipline, character and lifelong friendships,"" Manmohan concludes. ""But with passion comes the responsibility to equip our graduates with the tools, confidence and networks to succeed. If we do this, we will not only create businesses but build a more resilient economy for South Africa's future.""",The Citizen,2025-10-01T09:24:02Z,https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/education/south-africas-graduates-and-the-entrepreneurial-crossroads/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.659814,0.1450980392156862
INTERVIEW: Kobayashi Calls for LDP Generational Change,"Tokyo, Oct. 1 (Jiji Press)--Takayuki Kobayashi, Japan's former economic security minister running in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race, emphasizes his party's need for a generational change and a shift away from factional politics. ""It's easier to win the hearts of working generations if we who are living in the same times come to the forefront,"" Kobayashi said in a recent interview. Speaking about personnel management within the LDP, Kobayashi vowed to make fair assessments of individual lawmakers' abilities and achievements regardless of their career lengths and ages by establishing a multifaceted evaluation system. ""I will scrap old factional politics-based appointments and other unnecessary practices,"" he stressed. As a means to enhance restrictions on political donations from companies and groups, Kobayashi mentioned an acceptance ban on local chapters that do not file funds reports online. But at the same time, he said he will ""listen carefully to opinions from party members on this issue"" if he is elected LDP president on Saturday. Kobayashi has been calls for boosting the country's defense outlays to more than 2 pct of its gross domestic product. In the interview, he said it is ""politically irresponsible not to make necessary preparations due to a lack of permanent funding sources."" ""The government, for its part, should review subsidies and special tax measures to squeeze out money, if necessary,"" he went on to say. Furthermore, Kobayashi expressed willingness to ease Japan's regulations on overseas defense equipment transfers so the country ""can contribute to the world."" Meanwhile, the LDP leader hopeful pledged to tighten control of real estate acquisitions by foreigners, by expanding the scope of legally regulated properties with national security significance. Kobayashi stopped short of vowing to introduce a bill to set up a disaster management agency during next year's regular legislative session, only saying he will let preparatory work progress toward the session. Asked about assistance for low-income citizens, he reiterated that the middle class should be the primary focus of political support.

Community celebration planned to mark final Lingaun Valley Loop bus journey,"Richie Walsh, Lingaun Valley Tourism Chairman; Declan Rice, CEO, Kilkenny LEADER Partnership; Ade Walsh, Lingaun Valley Tourism Treasurer and Frank Quaid of Ring a Link on the Lingaun Valley bus The free orbital bus that stops at tourist attractions in the Lingaun Valley in south east Tipperary and south west Kilkenny will make its final journey on Saturday, October 4, and members of the local community will be preparing to greet it as it pulls up at its last stop. To mark the final journey, locals and those who have supported and contributed to the service in any way are being invited to attend a special celebratory event in Tullahought near Carrick-on-Suir where the bus will be welcomed at its final stop just after 5pm. An evening event for those involved then follows in Power's of Tullahought. READ ALSO: Organisers estimate 1,000 people have used tourist bus serving Tipperary's Lingaun Valley Preliminary research shows that over the past four months, more than 1,000 passenger journeys were made on the free action research rural transport service by visitors and locals alike, according to Declan Rice, Kilkenny LEADER Partnership CEO. He encouraged those who have not taken the Lingaun Loop to avail of the service in its final days. The project also was a huge marketing success for the Lingaun Valley, he added. ""People visited Knockroe Passage Tomb, the High Crosses, Ormond Castle, and the Suir Blueway. They hiked at Slievenamon, Kilmacoliver, and Bearna Brac. They stopped for lunch and coffee at Windgap Lakeside Tea Rooms and the Dovehill Centre. ""The motivation behind the service was two-fold - that you could successfully operate an orbital bus service that would link up with other conventional, fixed services, and that you could do it in a rural area and help rural tourism and rural mobility. Help residents move around the area. Rural isolation is a very important issue in the context of rural development. ""We are very happy with what everybody achieved. This was a partnership between ourselves, Ring a Link, the county council, the local community, and tourism interests. There was a lot of snagging. Logistics are never simple. There was huge interest and support locally. We did show that you can link up areas that are disparate. ""We've learnt a lot. We will take those learnings into next year and are looking at other regions in the county where a similar service might be established."" The free mini-bus service allows visitors to venture deep into the Lingaun Valley in the heart of rural Ireland and visit its high crosses, castles, churches, and tombs and enjoy a variety of walks and hikes, stopping off at local cafes and pubs along the way. The route and frequency were specifically designed to link in with existing public transport services from popular bases such as Kilkenny city and Waterford city, or Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir in Tipperary. The Lingaun Loop stops at, or close to, key visitor attractions. Passengers can hop on or off at any one of 13 stops along the 50km route and rejoin the service later. The Lingaun Loop orbits the area five times a day, seven days a week, starting at 9.30am and finishing just after 5.20pm. The project has been co-funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The 'action research' pilot initiative feeds into a research project which will showcase demand and mobility options throughout the summer season in rural areas.",tipperarylive.ie,2025-10-01T09:25:34Z,https://www.tipperarylive.ie/news/local-news/1907890/community-celebration-planned-to-mark-final-lingaun-valley-loop-bus-journey.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.661022,0.3019607843137255

£1 million jackpot win for two Premium Bonds holders from North East Scotland and Greater Manchester - IFA Magazine,"Two Premium Bonds holders from North East Scotland and Greater Manchester have each won a £1 million jackpot in October's draw. Meanwhile, a £100,000 prize from September 2010 remains unclaimed by a Premium Bonds holder in Greater Manchester. NS&I has reported today that October has delivered an extra special surprise for two Premium Bonds holders who are each celebrating a £1 million tax-free prize. This month there were more than six million Premium Bonds prizes worth over £399 million won by Bond holders. The first Premium Bonds £1 million winning Bond number this month is 498FZ511907 and is held by someone from North East Scotland. They purchased the winning Bond in April 2022 and hold £10,150. They are the 30th jackpot winner from Scotland. The second Premium Bonds £1 million jackpot Bond number is 524KB804512 and is held by someone in Greater Manchester. They hold £34,350 which they have held since January 2023. They are the fourth person to win the £1 million jackpot in Greater Manchester. Andrew Westhead, NS&I Retail Director, said: ""As autumn arrives, two winners from North East Scotland and Greater Manchester are settling into the season a million pounds richer. ""Premium Bonds offer tax-free prizes to savers with every £1 Bond having an equal chance of winning in the draw, and it's great to see our Scottish millionaire winning the jackpot with a holding of £10,150. ""Sometimes people don't update their contact details with us, which can lead to unclaimed prizes. In Greater Manchester, there's one £100,000 prize and two £50,000 prizes still waiting to be claimed from past draws."" October 2025 prize draw breakdown £399,290,100 will be paid out in the October Premium Bonds prize draw through 6,049,850 tax-free prizes. There were 133,096,700,225 £1 Bonds eligible for this draw. This brings the grand total of prizes since the first draw in June 1957 to 790 million and the value to £38 billion. What are Premium Bonds? Since they originally went on sale in November 1956, Premium Bonds have offered savers an accessible way to invest with the chance to win tax-free prizes. The first prize draw by ERNIE was held in June 1957. Instead of paying interest, each £1 Bond purchased is entered into a monthly prize draw, where prizes range from £25 to £1 million, making it an engaging way to save. The jackpot prize was increased to £1 million for the April 1994 draw. There are now two £1 million prizes each month. Individuals can hold up to £50,000 in Premium Bonds, including those aged under 16. Premium Bonds offer the security of being backed by HM Treasury, alongside the excitement of potentially winning tax-free prizes. Newly purchased Premium Bonds need to be held for one full calendar month after purchase before being eligible for the monthly prize draw. Checking prizes The Bond numbers for the two £1 million jackpot prize winners are announced on the first working day of each month, having been contacted directly by Agent Million. Bond holders can check if they have won prizes ranging from £25 to £100,000 the day after the first working day of each month by using the Premium Bonds prize checker app, visiting the NS&I website, or by asking Alexa. For October 2025, this is Thursday 2 October. To check prizes on the NS&I website, holders will need their Premium Bonds holder's number. For those using the Premium Bonds app, they can use their holder's number, or their NS&I number. Premium Bonds prizes notifications and unclaimed prizes Premium Bonds prize winners will receive notifications of their winnings each month via their chosen method such as email or text if they have registered their contact details. There are instances where customers relocate or change contact or bank details and forget to update NS&I with the new details which can lead to unclaimed prizes. Currently there are 2,646,717 unclaimed prizes worth £108,348,250 waiting to be claimed by Bond holders. The best way to avoid prizes going unclaimed is to have them paid directly into the holder's bank account or automatically reinvested into Premium Bonds up to the £50,000 holding limit. Nine in ten prizes are now paid in these ways. Customers who think they may have an unclaimed prize (prizes over 18 months old) can check by entering their holder's number into NS&I's online prize checker or the prize checker app. In North East Scotland, there are currently around 22,604 unclaimed prizes worth £874,925 dating back to1967.

Gold Momentum Builds Amid Uncertainty in US Labor Market | Investing.com,"Historically, August-September is often a period of high volatility for gold. This is usually driven by factors such as increased physical demand, year-end preparations where many institutions rebalance their portfolios, and macroeconomic sentiment. In terms of price scale, the rally has reached almost $400 per ounce. This is a significant range, indicating strong trend momentum after three months of sideways consolidation. Typically, a prolonged sideways phase serves as an accumulation/distribution stage. Once a breakout occurs, volatility explodes. Looking at today's price action, gold is currently facing a crucial resistance. This level serves as a short-term directional pivot, as the market seems uncertain whether to extend its bullish push or take a brief correction. However, on closer inspection, the breakout potential looks increasingly likely. Just a day earlier, gold successfully broke through a minor resistance, then performed a clean retest of its new support area. Such a pattern often indicates that the market is building momentum to continue the rally. Gold is currently trading at a highly crucial level, where the market is directly facing a key resistance around the 2,878 area. This level could trigger the next significant move, as a strong breakout above it may open the door for gold to move toward higher levels. For traders, there are two main scenarios to consider. The first is to wait for a breakout above the 2,878 resistance, then wait for a retest as confirmation before taking a long position. The second scenario, for more aggressive traders, is to prepare a long position around the 3,795 support area if the price pulls back and retests that level.",Investing.com,2025-10-01T09:25:27Z,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-momentum-builds-amid-uncertainty-in-us-labor-market-200667793,2025-10-01 17:26:52.663393,0.1450980392156862

Taiwan says it will resist pressure from Washington to move half of chip production to US,"Taiwan has vowed to resist pressure from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration. Washington has grown increasingly concerned about its heavy dependence on Taiwan, where chip giant TSMC supplies the vast majority of the world's advanced semiconductors to major clients like AI chip designer Nvidia and Apple. But many in self-ruled Taiwan view its chip-making prowess a ""silicon shield"" that could deter a potential invasion from China and rally international support for its security. Taiwan ""will not agree"" to producing 50% of its semiconductors - vital to everything from electronics and iPhones to training artificial intelligence and weapon systems - on US soil, Taiwan's Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said Wednesday. ""Our negotiating team has never made any commitment to splitting chips 50-50, so the public can rest assured,"" she told media after returning from the US after the latest round of tariff negotiations. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick sparked alarm among Taiwanese over the weekend by demanding in a TV interview that Taiwan split its chip production evenly between domestic and US facilities - adding fresh tensions to the ongoing US-Taiwan trade talks. Beyond Taipei's pushback, opposition party officials and experts have also voiced criticism. In the NewsNation interview, Lutnick referred to the concept of a ""silicon shield,"" saying the US would need 50% of domestic chip production to protect Taiwan. ""My argument to them was, well, if you have 95%, how am I gonna get it to protect you? You're going to put it on a plane? You're going to put it on a boat?"" he said, referring to the rough percentage of global advanced chip production in Taiwan. ""If we have half, we have the capacity to do what we need to do, if we need to do it,"" he added, without specifying the response the US may take in the scenario of a Chinese attack. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite having never controlled it and has vowed to annex it, by force if necessary. Lutnick also said that Washington has been in conversations about the proposal with Taipei, and that the Trump Administration's objective is to increase the market share of made-in-US chips ""to 40% and maybe 50%."" But Cheng said on Wednesday that the idea did not make it into the latest round of bilateral discussions. It was not clear if TSMC was involved in the negotiations between the US and Taiwan. CNN has reached out to TSMC for comment. On Monday, Hsu Yu-chen, a legislator of the opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), blasted the US demand as an ""outright plunder"" instead of ""cooperation,"" urging the government to reject the demand that she said amounts to ""selling out the nation.""",Yahoo!

Qatar: MoT begins operating Karwa electric robotaxis,"Doha, Qatar: The Ministry of Transport (MoT) has begun operating Karwa electric robotaxis, making Doha one of the first capitals in the region to introduce this cutting-edge technology. This groundbreaking initiative reflects Qatar's dedication to harnessing innovative technology to elevate public services and deliver enhanced safety and comfort for citizens, residents and visitors alike, Government Communications Office (GCO) has stated in a post on its X platform. In line with Qatar's National Vision 2030, Doha becomes one of the first capitals in the region to launch autonomous vehicle pilot programme benefiting from Qatar's world-class infrastructure and 5G digital coverage, GCO added. The post further highlighted the country's adoption of technological innovation to modernise public transport, promoting sustainability and smart-city solutions, and the highest safety standards in the autonomous vehicle industry. In June this year, the Ministry of Transport announced that it is set to oversee a test run by Mowasalat (Karwa) of level-4 electric robotaxis in specific areas in Qatar, primarily on tourist and services routes. Karwa will be working closely with the MoT over the coming period to scan and prepare the proposed routes. It noted that the test run of the electric robotaxis will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will be conducted under the supervision of a specialised team with no passengers on board. The second phase will be totally autonomous with passengers on board. Each autonomous taxi used in the trials is equipped with six long- and mid-range cameras, four radars, and four LiDAR units, enabling precise detection and navigation control during operation. The second edition of the Autonomous e-Mobility Forum 2026 will be held from April 7-9, 2026 which is a premier global platform for autonomous and electric transportation. It is centred on the future of mobility and will gather policymakers, industry leaders, researchers and innovators from more than 25 countries. With a focus on technology, sustainability and policy, the forum will offer a unique space for cross-sector collaboration and idea exchange. The Third Qatar National Development Strategy (NDS3) focuses on benefiting from advanced technologies and achieving sustainable development and economic diversification to further boost Qatar's leading global position on the transportation map. The Transportation Master Plan for Qatar-2050 works as a roadmap for investing in land transportation infrastructure and identifies the frameworks and future orientations for developing the transportation networks nationwide in a way that ensures their integration with land uses, urban development, population growth and meeting the future demand for transportation. © Dar Al Sharq Press, Printing and Distribution.

'Romance fraudsters' used fake dating profiles to steal almost £2m from victims,"Five men created fake profiles on dating websites to defraud victims out of almost £2m. Fawaz Ali, 27, Ebenezer Tackie, 42, Michael Quartey, 28, Kwabena Edusei, 37, and George Melseaux, 40, were part of a criminal group which manipulated victims, who were mainly female, into believing they were in a genuine loving relationship, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. At an early stage, the relationships developed into declarations of love and commitment, but with a business transaction to be completed before any meeting could take place. The fraudsters tricked victims into sending money on the understanding that it would be paid back with interest once a lucrative business venture was completed. Money was also requested for other apparent emergencies including the loss of a wallet or legal bills which had to be paid before the individual could return to the UK. Surrey Police said these requests were often supported by false documents, passports, legal letters and photographs, with the group coercing and controlling their victims through exploiting their vulnerabilities. Victims sent money to the men's bank accounts or in cash through the post with the fraud being repeated many times until they had no money left or became suspicious, stopped making payments and alerted the authorities, the CPS added. The group were jailed at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday for their roles in the scheme. The majority of transactions took place in the UK, with some overseas victims identified throughout Europe, the US and Australia, police said. Those managing the false identities then used a network of individuals running multiple bank accounts to launder the proceeds of the romance fraud and other forms of criminality. There were 40 confirmed victims of the romance scam but the total number of suspected victims of fraud was 99, according to the CPS. The total amount lost by victims through romance fraud specifically is estimated to be around £1.8m, police said. The five men were jailed for terms of between seven and four years in prison. Police said extracts from victims' statements were read out in court with one stating: ""I lost my home as I could not keep up with the cost of rising bills. ""I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I was scammed, so I have not told anyone about this and have lied to my family and friends. ""I am very wary when any man tries to get close to me as I always wonder if he will try and scam me."" Det Con Sarah Shaw, the investigating officer from Surrey and Sussex Police's economic crime unit, said: ""While only 40 victims reported the fraud, most of whom went on to provide statements, our inquiries show that there were at least another 59 who were conned. ""Romance fraudsters gain their victim's trust and build a relationship with them. ""They make everything about the romance feel normal, but their aim is to get money or personal information. ""They create a story that sounds believable and start the relationship in a normal way, however the relationship quickly becomes very intense with the victim being bombarded with declarations of love."" She added: ""No-one should ever send money or disclose personal information to someone they meet online.""",Yahoo,2025-10-01T09:22:02Z,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/romance-fraudsters-used-fake-dating-092202635.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.665736,-0.403921568627451
"Local woman, 96, gets chance to tour high school and is surprised with diploma","""I cried a lot about that,"" Lois remembered. ""I was crying because I didn't get to graduate."" Thanks to some creative clothing choices, Lois had managed to hide her pregnancy. She left school a few weeks before graduation after her doctor ordered complete bed rest. School officials were unaware of her situation and she was told that if they they found out about it, she would be dismissed. Judy Kennard of Vandalia, a Stivers' alum, said she could relate to Lois' situation. ""It was a different time,"" she said. ""I ran off and eloped in April of 1965. I was on the Prom Court and they kicked me off because I was married. You weren't allowed to participate if you were married."" A happy ending But 77 years later, on a sunny September Saturday morning, 96-year-old Lois Hicks of Springboro, was in for a huge surprise. She'd been told that her family had arranged a tour of Stivers High School. The last time she'd walked the halls was in May of 1948. But Lois had no idea what was awaiting her: a group of excited Stivers' alums and faculty, a videographer, a bouquet of lovely flowers and best of all, a cap, a gown and a high school diploma with her name inscribed on it. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. After being helped into the cap and gown -- courtesy of 2025 grad Lily Perdue and her grandfather Chris who made a 1948 black and orange tassel -- the ceremony began. Liz Whipps, Dean of Arts at Stivers School for the Arts, began to speak. ""Your class was probably one of the best classes we've ever graduated from Stivers. You and your classmates were responsible for making the United State of America one of the strongest nations in the world,"" Whipps said. ""So I want you to know that magic and all your tenacity and all your hopes and dreams continue to carry this country forward. It is our honor today today to present you with something long overdue. They say the wealth of a person is measured in the love they have given and received from others. So with this crowd here today, you are greatly loved."" ""I can't thank you all enough for doing this for me,"" Lois responded. ""I just think it's the most wonderful thing."" Touring her alma mater Following the September ""graduation,"" there was a tour of the school and a chance to reminisce. The auditorium looked familiar to Lois; although it was renovated and updated in 2015, the ornate Victorian theater had been refurbished to preserve its historic beauty. Lois also remembered running up the steps of the main entrance on her way to class. The only change was that today that doorway is a side entrance to the school. While at Stivers, Lois played the saxophone in the band and also worked at Equity Dairy on Brown Street which was managed by her parents. Following graduation, she attended the Vogue Modeling Agency and worked as a model for Elder-Beerman and Rike's department stores. She was named Miss Bavarian Beer when she was 23. Over the years, Lois held a number of other jobs. She worked as a cake decorator for 50 years -- first at Murphy's Baker and then Belmont Bakery -- then opened her own business, specializing in wedding cakes. She also worked for more than 40 years for two pharmaceutical companies. Keeping the secret The heartwarming graduation story really begins 15 years ago after Lois' husband died and her daughter and son-in-law moved in with her. But after both of them passed away within a year of one another and Lois was hospitalized with pneumonia, it was apparent to granddaughter Stef and her husband Bill Lauson, that living alone was no longer an option for Grandma. In February 2022, Lois and her two little dogs, moved in with her grandkids and their 18 year-old-daughter, Amanda, and their three cats. It's been a blessing for everyone. ""In the spring of 2023, Lois shared with me and Stef that she always wanted to see a concert at the Grand Ole Opry; in September of that year we took her to see a show there in which the Oak Ridge Boys were the headliner. The show was emceed by Larry Gatlin of the brothers, who kissed her on the forehead. We have taken her to Clearwater Beach in Florida and travels with us to to Wisconsin for Thanksgiving and to Chicago for Christmas where she is embraced by my side of the family."" Lois has become a big football fan and helps Bill root for the Green Bay Packers and Notre Dame. ""She takes great pride in never becoming a 'burden'"" to us. She continues to clean the house and do our laundry. She constantly reminds our daughter, Amanda, to bring her laundry home once a week from her apartment at the University of Dayton where she's a senior. Lois also enjoys going for walks in the neighborhood with Stef and her two dogs. It was Bill who came up with the Stivers idea. ""Among the things Grandma shared with us over the years is that she never received her high school diploma,"" said Bill. I currently have an office space that's located across the parking lot from Stivers and one day my wife remarked that Grandma would probably love to see the school again and see how it had changed.""

Salt River Project completes hydropower modernisation project,"SRP's Roosevelt, Horse Mesa, Mormon Flat, and Stewart Mountain dams generate 265 MW of hydropower - enough to power more than 60 000 homes annually. SRP modernised its legacy excitation systems - vital for power generation - and integrated them with the distributed control systems already in place at its four hydroelectric dams. By standardising on Emerson's Ovation™ Automation Platform and implementing modern control strategies, SRP reduced operations and maintenance costs by 30% and cut troubleshooting time by half - helping ensure operational continuity and strengthening grid performance. Enhanced operational visibility keeps critical start-up and shutdown procedures efficient, avoiding delays that could have doubled their duration. Shari Brady, SRP Hydro Electrical Engineer, commented: ""As the long-time operator of the Bureau of Reclamation's dams, we have a responsibility to ensure delivery of a reliable, clean, and continuous source of power the community depends on. By standardising on Emerson's fully unified Ovation automation platform across our hydro fleet for excitation and plant control - and through close collaboration between project teams - we completed all system installations on time, even with aggressive schedules. We now have greater operational insight and easier troubleshooting, which helps us maintain unit reliability in the 90th percentile."" Rising electricity consumption driven by record growth in the Phoenix area along with extreme temperatures in the service area have required energy providers like SRP to continue to invest in improving its infrastructure, including generator excitation. Bob Yeager, President of Emerson's Power and Water Business, added: ""Increased visibility and reliability of hydro operations helps Salt River Project ensure continuous operation to efficiently supply their customers with the power they rely on 24/7. SRP's vision for standardising on a fully unified automation system was a transformative step that will position them for success - even in the face of shifting energy markets and increased need for power - for decades to come."" The custom Ovation Excitation Systems, two of which are for pump and energy storage units that require unique integration when switching to pump mode, are seamlessly integrated into the existing Ovation distributed controls. The new cohesive plant system improves SRP's hydroelectric capabilities, which help strengthen grid reliability and meet the demands of an evolving grid using more renewable energy resources like solar and wind. SRP's new, fully integrated automation platform simplifies operations and maintenance by using the same spare parts, streamlining training, maintaining operator familiarity, and managing a single point of contact for automation support and service.

Homeware chain known as 'little Ikea' wants to double UK stores in big expansion - The Mirror,"Søstrene Grene currently operates in 330 locations across 17 European countries, and is now the family-owned chain is looking to open up to 100 shops in Britain A trendy homeware chain dubbed 'little Ikea' by shoppers has ambitious plans to double the number of stores in the UK. Søstrene Grene has developed a cult following since launching its first store in Britain back in 2016. The family-owned brand, which has since expanded across the North of England, is known for its Scandinavian design-led approach, offering a curated set of homeware, kitchen items, gifts, stationery and more to a growing customer base. Each store follows a maze-like layout, similar to that of Swedish giant Ikea and Flying Tiger in Copenhagen, promoting slow browsing and discovery before reaching the checkouts near the exit. Now it's looking to expand much further as plans have since been announced. The Danish retailer welcomed in punters at a whopping 47 new locations this year alone, with a majority of those in the UK and Germany. Moving forward, however, it is showing little to no signs of slowing down as the group aims to open 20 more by the end of 2025, reaching in and around 100 in Britain come 2027. It comes after the firm confirmed they saw ""particularly high performance in the UK"" where revenues are said to have soared by a staggering 130% year-on-year. Meanwhile, Søstrene Grene has also announced it will open a £36 million distribution centre in the Netherlands that will measure 445,000sqm. ""We are proud to announce another record year, with exceptional top-line growth and a solid result despite major investments and structural changes,"" said Søstrene Grene group CEO and co-owner Mikkel Grene in a statement. ""The UK has been a major growth driver, and the warm response from British customers has exceeded expectations. Our record-breaking Christmas season was also a key contributor to the results, underlining the growing loyalty of our customer base."" These expansion plans come at a time when many shops on the high street are bringing the shutters down. Discount brand Poundland continues to close outlets, with four shutting in October alone, while the likes of Sports Direct, Starbucks, JD Sports, Natwest and more are also leaving a number of locations across the UK. JD Sports revealed group like-for-like sales fell 2.5% to £5.94billion across the 26 weeks ending August 2. Organic sales climbed 2.7% whilst total sales surged 18% following acquisitions of the Hibbert and Courir brands. The retailer confirmed like-for-like sales plummeted 3.8% in its crucial North American division and fell 3.3% domestically Chief executive Regis Schultz said: ""We delivered organic sales growth of 2.7% in H1, in what remains a tough trading environment. This demonstrates the resilience of our business, underpinned by our agile multi-brand model, broad geographic reach and unmatched connection with customers."" ""In an environment of strained consumer finances and evolving brand product cycles, operating and financial discipline remains a core focus for JD, and we are controlling our costs and cash well. ""Whilst we remain cautious on the trading environment for the second half, we expect limited impact from US tariffs this financial year, and our full year profit before tax and adjusting items to be in line with current market expectations.""",Mirror,2025-10-01T09:18:10Z,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/homeware-chain-known-little-ikea-35994236,2025-10-01 17:26:52.667741,0.1843137254901961
What tenants in Switzerland need to know about new rent law,"From October 1st 2025, landlords in several Swiss cantons will have to provide new information when renting out an apartment. What is it, and how does it benefit tenants? In the event of a housing shortage, some cantons may, from this day onward, require the use of the official form for the notification of the initial rent when concluding a new residential lease. This will ensure that tenants are informed about the previous rent and their right to contest their own. The use of the official form - which must contain the most recently valid reference interest rate or the most recently valid inflation rate - is also intended to encourage the landlords to exercise restraint when increasing the rent or when changing a tenant. However, this new obligation only applies in cantons which already have mandatory disclosure - that is, in addition to the new rent, the landlord must also disclose the amount of the old rent on an official form. This is already obligatory in Basel-City, Fribourg, Geneva, Lucerne, Zug, and Zurich, as well as in certain municipalities/districts of Neuchâtel and Vaud. According to the Swiss Tenants Association, ""the Federal Council hopes that this will increase transparency, while tenants' associations see it as an important step in the fight against excessive rents. For landlords, the change means that they will have to fill out their documents more carefully, because mistakes could quickly lead to legal proceedings. The background behind the new law A study carried out in 2024 by the real estate company Wüest Partner, found that after a move to a new apartment, even a smaller one, a large portion of tenants pay higher rents than previous occupants. One reason is the persisting -- and, in some cases, worsening -- housing shortage. Another is that when an old tenant moves out and a new one arrives, landlords have the right to increase the rent by up to 10 percent. This is legal and, unfortunately, many tenants have to put up with this hike. However, a problem arises when the property owner is raising the rent by more than 10 percent. This is considered an abusive practice, which the new law is aiming to correct. READ ALSO: Can you know how much your Swiss landlord charged previous tenants? What happens now? From today, October 1, 2025, only the new, 'more transparent' forms must be used in cantons subject to this rule. If a new tenant notices that the form does not contain the most recently valid reference interest rate or the most recently valid inflation rate, the agreed-upon rent is invalid. What if you live in a canton that doesn't have this mandatory disclosure rule? If you suspect that your rent exceeds the 10-percent threshold allowed for increases, you can dispute it. First, though, you must find out how much exactly the previous occupants of your dwelling were charged. Fortunately, this information is public knowledge. You have the right to ask your landlord what the previous rent was for the apartment, and the landlord must tell you.",The Local,2025-10-01T09:24:47Z,https://www.thelocal.ch/20251001/what-tenants-in-switzerland-need-to-know-about-new-rent-law,2025-10-01 17:26:52.668250,0.2313725490196079
The MotoGP project leaves Lombok villagers expelled in the limbo on earth - ExBulletin,"THE A land that the villager once felt called at his home was swallowed by the Indonesian MotoGP circuit as part of a mega tourism project accused of forced evictions and rights of rights. Indonesia will host the newly crowned MotoGP champion Marc Marquez in Lombok Island this weekend for the first race since it equaled Valentino Rossis seven titles with Victory in Japan. Apart from the Mandalika circuit, there is not much to celebrate for dozens of Aboriginal sasak families who say that they are faced with land expulsions and remuneration battles linked to the development of sites. They forced us to leave like dogs and chickens. They are like a thief, said Senum, who had to move twice since the arrival of the authorities with heavy machines in 2018. He says that it was promised 10 million rupees for land which became part of the MotoGP track, well below the market price, but which ultimately received only three million. The world's leading motorcycle race returned to Indonesia in 2022 after an interruption of 25 years on a track of 4.31 kilometers in the seaside resort of Beach Kuta. The government hopes that the project will diversify tourism from the Popular Island Bali, but it has attracted a fight of several years between the authorities and the inhabitants. Most of the 124 families in the region were forced or moved elsewhere with only 44 to fight for compensation. Sibawahi says that the project consumed the land it used for coconut palms and livestock after the authorities asked 2020. He lost nearly four hectares after the police and soldiers seized him in 2021 and are still waiting for compensation for his loss. I cannot accept it. My feelings are indescribable. It's too sad for the oppressed like us, he said. The Lombok impoverishment had trouble rebuilding after a deadly earthquake of 2018 while former president Joko Widodo praised the project to employ 3,000 inhabitants. Other residents protested around the track and outside the governors' office, demanding the return of their land or adequate compensation. New evictions in July left more than 2,000 people without their main source of income according to UN experts. Experts have alarmed themselves in the face of intimidation and the alleged appeal of force in a August report, warning that communities are now living in fear. The Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation Corporation and Lombok's local authorities did not respond to requests for comments on allegations. Some residents say that they cannot even benefit from the track because they are prevented from selling to visitors and have prevented from leaving their new houses at the race weekend. Were like a cow attached in a cage, said Senum on the restrictions they face. The housewife Suman was paid 15 million rupees to leave her house rented near what is now a turn of the MotoGP track and said that she was happy to have moved away. Others like Senum continue to hold for better compensation for their lost land and their livelihoods. Pay us correctly and give us our dignity, he said as an excavator scratched on his old country.

Priya Ahluwalia grew up on the Puma Suede - now she's got her own,"Our editors work with affiliates when we select some or all of the products featured. We will receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases through these links. British designer Priya Ahluwalia is dropping her very first collab with Puma this week, and she's opening with the legendary Suede. It may seem like an obvious place to start - it's one of the most storied sneakers in the brand's entire line-up - but for her, it's a dream that she's has since she was a kid. ""The Puma Suede is an iconic silhouette that I remember wearing throughout different times in my childhood,"" she tells me over the phone. ""I remember seeing them on everyone from Jay-Z and Slick Rick, to the skateboarders in the park near me growing up in South London - and so I knew that I wanted to give an Ahluwalia spin on them."" While the her brand is usually known for its big, bright colour combos and patterns rooted in her Nigerian-Indian heritage, Ahluwalia's version of the Suede keeps things nice and simple. It's black and silver, with clean lines, slick leather mudguards, and a TPU Formstrip that runs across the lateral and medial sidewalls. But what makes this pair really stand out is the ombré midsole down below. ""Originally, the midsole was going to be multicoloured,"" she says. ""But when I saw the development sample, I knew instinctively it should be black and silver. It's inspired by the silver linings in our day-to-day lives. It feels very London but also universal."" The shoes come in some special packaging too, which was custom made for this project. Something else that makes this Suede more Ahluwalia is the piping - a feature that's been part of the label's ID since it was founded in 2018. ""Piping has always been a key detail, and you'll see it in everything from our suiting to our knitwear,"" she says. ""So I knew that I wanted to include that on the trainers. There is a reflective piping detail which you may miss in the daytime, but is very clear at night."" The collab doesn't just stop at footwear, either. Alongside the Suede, Ahluwalia and Puma have set up a mentorship scheme for 18 to 25 year olds working in film and fashion. Some of the shortlisted applicants even attended her London Fashion Week show in September, where she also sent the Speedcat OG down the runway - a sign that there's a lot more cooking. The Ahluwalia x Puma Suede will drop on October 1 at Ahluwalia, followed by a wider launch on October 4 at Puma and select retailers worldwide. There's also an all-white pair on the way, but it's made exclusively for friends and family of the brand - sorry.",British GQ,2025-10-01T09:23:58Z,https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/priya-ahluwalia-grew-up-on-the-puma-suede-now-shes-got-her-own,2025-10-01 17:26:52.669192,0.1764705882352942
New cafe and market opens in former Starbucks in downtown Greenville,"GREENVILLE -- A cafe and market focusing on local items has opened on downtown's north end at the Hyatt Regency hotel. Meeting Grounds serves Counter Culture Coffee, drinks, pastries and fresh sandwiches from its shop on NOMA Square, which overlooks North Main Street. It's open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. A grab-and-go section provides drinks and prepared foods for outings like picnics at the city's parks. Meeting Grounds also hawks snacks and items from across the Carolinas and Georgia, such as French Broad Chocolate from Asheville. Customers place orders at self-serve kiosks. The cafe and market replaces a Starbucks franchise that was owned by Auro Hotels, the company behind the Hyatt Regency. Auro owns Meeting Grounds. ""Meeting Grounds is more than exceptional drinks and fresh, chef-crafted food -- it's about creating a place where people naturally want to gather, whether that's lingering over a morning cappuccino in the café or picking up the perfect provisions for an afternoon in Falls Park,"" Brian Crowne, Auro Hotels' food and beverage director, said in a news release. Starbucks first opened at the Hyatt Regency downtown in 2014, when it signed an agreement with JHM Hotels. At the time, the hotel at NOMA Square was owned by JHM Hotels, which split into four companies in 2017. The Hyatt is now owned by Auro Hotels.

Mideast Stocks: Gulf markets mixed in early trade as US shutdown raises concerns,"Major Gulf stock markets opened with mixed performance on Wednesday, as the U.S. government shutdown raised concerns about the delay in the release of crucial jobs data, clouding future interest rate trends. The U.S. government shut down much of its operations as deep partisan divisions prevented Congress and the White House from reaching a funding deal, setting off what could be a long, grueling standoff that could lead to the loss of thousands of federal jobs. The shutdown could delay the release of key economic data, including the non-farm payrolls report due on Friday. Monetary policy shifts in the U.S. have a significant impact on Gulf markets, where most currencies are pegged to the dollar. Saudi Arabia's benchmark index gained 0.1%, with Saudi Arabian Mining Company gaining 1.1%. In Abu Dhabi, the index eased 0.1%, hit by a 2.9% fall in ADNOC Distribution as the firm traded ex-dividend. Oil prices - a catalyst for the Gulf's financial markets - steadied after two days of declines as investors weighed OPEC+ plans for a larger output hike next month and the outcome of a U.S. government shutdown that could impact economic activity and fuel demand. Dubai's benchmark DFM General Index rose 0.5%, buoyed by gains in key stocks. Blue-chip real estate developer Emaar Properties climbed 1.9%.

"'It just kept raining:' It's been 10 years since the 1,000-year flood drowned Columbia","COLUMBIA -- For the first five days of October 2015, Columbia and the Midlands were swamped by nearly 30 inches of rain, setting the stage for the ""1,000-year flood."" Nineteen people were killed across the state. Hundreds of homes and roadways were damaged or destroyed. Water service was spotty for days. Dams were overwhelmed and failed. Cars were swept away. Damage was estimated at just under $1.5 billion. Like Hurricane Hugo before it and Helene after, the 2015 flood became a watershed moment for the region, becoming a cautionary tale for storms since. Ten years later, much -- but not all -- of the damage has been repaired. Along with tales of destruction, memories of residents rescuing neighbors in johnboats and feeding and clothing each other in the aftermath have endured. Source: National Weather Service 'It feels like yesterday' Brooks Brewer returned to his home off Lake Katherine from a wedding in Sumter at around midnight on Oct. 4, 2015. His wife, Brett, had grown up in the house, and in 2015 they lived there with their three daughters between ages five to two. In all her years living there, Brett had never seen water reach higher than flooding the road, during Hugo in 1989. At 4 a.m., Brooks and Brett awoke to the shriek of their home alarm as water rushed around their house. They initially monitored the water's rise, leaving their daughters asleep upstairs. Then came a call from a neighbor upstream saying a dam had just broken. More water was on the way. ""I was putting towels in front of the doors, thinking I'm gonna keep it out,"" Brooks Brewer said. ""And then we start hearing bubbles, and we're like, 'Where's that noise coming through from?' And it was coming up through the air vents into the house."" At daybreak, they saw the first kayak pass their home. After bringing some of their valuables upstairs, they decided to leave when the water reached about knee-deep in their home. They loaded 5-year-old Sarah Taylor Brewer, 4-year-old Townes and 2-year-old Anna Belle into a neighbor's johnboat, which took them to a house on high ground down the street. Brooks went back out in the boat and helped bring others to dry land. Some of the neighbors he assisted awoke to his knocks, stepping out of their beds into inches of water, he said. ""It feels like yesterday,"" Brett Brewer said. The weeks after the flood saw neighbors, friends and strangers help clear the mess left behind after the water receded. The Brewers stayed with family in the area until finally returning to their home five months later, they said.

AP AND SHANA TURNER/STAFF ""It really doesn't feel like 10 years,"" Brooks Brewer said. ""Really, the girls kind of had PTSD there for a little while. Anytime we had a big storm coming, they were, like 'Is it going to flood? Is it going to flood?' ... It was traumatic, definitely."" 'Just floating in the middle of the flood' Jeff Wilkinson lived in a picturesque house with a backyard overlooking Wildcat Creek, which runs from Fort Jackson to Lake Katherine. He was used to seeing the creek swell into his yard when heavy rains came. As a reporter for The State newspaper for nearly 20 years, he was accustomed to running toward storms most people fled. He had planned to watch the water's progress to the house, and to leave if things got too serious. But a dam failure upstream caused the water to rise quicker than anticipated. Wilkinson and his girlfriend, Dana, jumped into his car and backed into the street, only to be swept away by the flood waters. Water quickly reached their shoulders inside the car. The doors and windows wouldn't budge. The pair ultimately escaped through the sunroof and found themselves drifting down the street on the floating car. Wilkinson had somehow kept his umbrella with him, he remembered. ""For some reason, I raised the umbrella,"" he said. ""So in a surreal kind of scene, there we are sitting on top of my white Honda with a green golf umbrella up, just floating in the middle of the flood."" After the car hit a group of bushes and began to sink, the pair made their way through water up to Wilkinson's nose -- he stands six feet and one inch tall -- to a neighbor's house. They huddled on the second floor of the home with the neighboring family, until a boat came by and pulled them from a second-story window. With their cellphones ruined, Wilkinson and Dana went to a nearby hotel. The first had water -- offering them a chance to shower -- but no power. A second hotel had electricity, but no water. Unable to remember any phone numbers, they couldn't reach any of their loved ones. Wilkinson was finally able to get a message out when he made his way to the former Bluff Road offices of The State to post on his Facebook account. He spent the next year living at Dana's apartment in Forest Acres -- itself dry, but surrounded by flood damage -- for over a year. He has since moved to the top of ""a big a-- hill in Cayce."" He encourages everyone to keep phone numbers written down and heed flood warnings. 'A feeling you can't describe' Forest Acres -- considered ""ground zero"" for the flooding -- was dealing with another tragedy before the rain began to fall. Greg Alia, a young, recently married Forest Acres Police Department officer with a 6-month-old son, was shot and killed while on duty on Sept. 30. His death rocked the city. Those attending his funeral on Oct. 3 remember finding it fitting that a steady rain was falling. FAPD officers and staff were given until Oct. 4 off, while other local agencies filled in, then-Police Chief Gene Sealy remembered. One employee was left at the police department headquarters when Sealy got a call that water was coming into the building. ""Poor thing was trying to sweep it out the door with a broom,"" Sealy said a decade later. Water rose along Gills Creek, cutting off Forest Drive and flooding several commercial buildings. At one point, the water completely cut the city in two. Over 170 homes and a dozen businesses were damaged. FAPD ended up with two feet of water in its building. The water came to the top of Alia's patrol car, which had been parked out front and covered in memorial flowers. The department coordinated operations via cellphone. Then-Mayor Frank Brunson, after going door-to-door encouraging residents downstream to evacuate, took to the air in a state police helicopter to get an overhead view of the city's damage. Brunson noticed something colorful moving on the ground. He asked the pilot to take him closer. The pilot hesitated. ""When we got closer, I realized what he had been protecting me from. It was people, and all their belongings, spread out,"" Brunson said. ""It's a feeling you can't describe."" The damage reminded him of what he saw on a visit to New Orleans in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. The city was swamped with issuing permits for people rebuilding homes or businesses for years after the flooding, city building official Laura Boatright said. Some never rebuilt. Several buildings were razed and replaced with a city park honoring the flood and two FAPD officers killed in the line of duty, including Alia, in 2024. Some buildings along Gills Creek near the park remain vacant and boarded up 10 years later. Along with the devastation, the flood is remembered for how the community rallied to support each other. ""That was one of the silver linings of it all, was that obviously we were already getting support because of what happened with Greg, and it just extended and went above and beyond when the flood happened,"" Boatright said. Private dam owners now know they are responsible for maintaining the dams to survive heavy rains, and residents are more aware of flooding and severe weather threats because of the flood, Forest Acres City Administrator Shaun Greenwood said. Some lessons learned in disaster response in the city came in handy nine years later when Hurricane Helene caused generational wind damage in the city, Greenwood added. ""I think Helene is a very good barometer to say lessons learned from 2015 are in place now, and that's why I think things were able to be opened and things were able to be done a lot quicker than what I think a lot of people would expect,"" he said. 'Not too much time to spare' Clint Shealy had been on staff at the Columbia Canal Water Treatment Plant for about six weeks when the rains came. Watching the Clemson-Notre Dame football game on Oct. 3, he thought, ""It just keeps raining, and it won't stop."" On Sunday, Oct. 4, Shealy told his wife he was going to briefly stop by the plant to check on things before meeting her at church. He was at the canal for the next six days. That week saw the staff at the Canal Plant fighting to keep the water running for 200,000 customers, he remembered 10 years later. First came the thousands of gallons of water ""hemorrhaging"" through water lines broken by rushing floodwaters, unable to be repaired or even found because they were still submerged, he said. At one point, the plant had to be evacuated due to fears over the water being released through the Lake Murray Dam's emergency gates. Then the canal levee broke, releasing Columbia's primary source of drinking water into the Congaree River. Temporary pumps were able to pull water from the swollen river into the plant's reservoir, Shealy said. But as the flood waters receded, not enough water was coming in to meet the demand of customers and broken pipes. While some workers fought to get enough water into the system, others joined the National Guard dropping sandbags and rocks into the canal to try and head off the breach in the levee. ""A little after midnight, when we broke up afterwards, we went outside and we were all like, 'It's just raining,' you know? 'Maybe this isn't coming.' And then at 3:30, my next door neighbor's knocking on my door going, 'There's water coming in my house.'"" -- Columbia Mayor Daniel Rickenmann It wasn't until Oct. 11 that more water was coming into the system than going out. At that point, there was less than half a day's worth of water in the plant's reservoir, Shealy said. ""We were all standing at the raw water reservoir kind of waiting for the bathtub swirling effect to occur. It was just nobody had ever seen it that low,"" he said. ""We did make it, and with not too much time to spare."" Ten years later, the canal's levee is still broken, though the city has recently cleared the final federal hurdles to begin repair work. 'I've never seen anything like it.' Daniel Rickenmann was watching the Clemson-Notre Dame football game on Oct. 3, 2015, with his neighbors. When the group parted ways around midnight, they were skeptical the light rain outside would measure up to the deluge that had been forecast. ""It's just raining, you know? Maybe this isn't coming,"" Rickenmann recalled thinking. ""And then at 3:30, my next door neighbor's knocking on my door going, 'There's water coming in my house,"" he recalled 10 years later. At the time on hiatus from his time as a Columbia City Councilman and some seven years before he was elected mayor, Rickenmann watched the street in front of his house turn into a river. Cars were swept away, and neighbors were stranded. In the years since the flood, the city has invested in drainage improvements to various waterways in the city to improve flood resistance, Rickenmann said. The city has better communication with other government entities to better coordinate disaster response, and residents tend to be more flood-aware. But to some point, little can be done about 20 inches of rain falling in five days. ""People, I mean, were caught totally off guard all the way around, and I don't know that we could have changed anything,"" he said. What used to be a laundry and cleaner business was completely flooded and destroyed in the Thousand Year Flood in 2015 turned into a Freshe Poke in 2019 after severe remodeling and restoration. The new business stands on Forest Drive, S.C. on Sept. 16, 2025. AP AND SHANA TURNER/STAFF 'I can remember the panic and the concern in her voice.' State climatologist Hope Mizzell had watched the system bringing the floods roll into South Carolina before the rain had even begun to fall. A combination of cold air in the upper atmosphere, a stationary front off the coast and the tropical moisture of Hurricane Joaquin would end up bringing 27.19 inches of rain to South Carolina from Oct. 1 to 5. When the rain first arrived in the Midlands, Mizzell remembers receiving a call from a friend living near Lake Katherine in the Gills Creek Watershed, one of the areas hit hardest by the flooding. ""She looks out her window, and all she sees is water, and the water is up above her window of her car,"" Mizzell recalled. ""I can remember the panic and the concern in her voice."" For Mizzell, the 2015 flood underscored changes that needed to be made across the state to help weather experts better prepare for and understand flooding events. While some improvements to the state's flood modeling, more could be done. ""I've never seen anything like it. I mean, since Hugo, but here, these are areas that don't normally flood."" -- Columbia Mayor Daniel Rickenmann The state is one of 10 without a statewide network of automated environmental weather stations, Mizzell said. Any automated weather stations in South Carolina are funded by counties. 'There's still a lot of people at risk' John Kupfer escaped the brunt of the flooding at his home in Irmo. He stepped up to help out in Columbia, serving food to those affected by the storm. The conversations he had with the people hit hardest by the flood stand out most to him. Some wanted to talk about it, some wanted to talk about anything but. As a scientist and geography professor at USC, Kupfer went on to study the event and its aftermath. Actions have been taken since 2015 to prevent similar tragedies. Namely, there's been an emphasis on converting developed, impervious, flood damaged land back into greenspace. More greenspace means more soil to soak up more water if a similar storm were to hit Columbia again. But new development in Columbia may offset some of the effects of increased greenspace, Kupfer said. ""There's still a lot of people at risk,"" he said. ""And the issue of development and how it changes the hydrology of these systems, that hasn't really stopped."" 'I had never seen anything like that before' Most of the dams around Columbia that broke during the 2015 flood were repaired by 2022, but damage remains. So much water surged down Mill Creek that it crested several feet over the park walkway that rings Pinewood Lake, said Greg Sinkler, president of the Pinewood Lake Park Foundation. Its force ripped a hole in the emergency spillway of the lake's dam, which is owned by the foundation. ""I had never seen anything like that before,"" Sinkler said, describing water slamming into the lake's bank and crashing into the air before coming down so hard that it dug holes in the other side of the walkway. Forest Drive before The Thousand Year Flood in 2015, S.C., and after on Sept. 16, 2025. AP AND SHANA TURNER/STAFF A decade later, that breach still hasn't been repaired, leaving the walkway unusable for the Lower Richland park's visitors and limiting how high the lake's water level can rise before waters flow through the open, earthen hole. The park foundation doesn't have any income to pay for repairs, Sinkler said, and Richland County, which owns the rest of the park, has been unwilling to fund work on the land it doesn't own despite the foundation's efforts. That predicament is not limited to the Pinewood Lake dam's owners. Most of South Carolina's dams are privately owned, and there are limited sources of public funding to pay for the at-times costly repairs and maintenance needed on dams that could threaten lives or property if they failed. The Legislature doubled its funding for repair grants in the 2025-26 state budget to $3 million. 'I think we made it.' Ten years after the historic flood, much of the damage has been repaired. Some scars remain -- in the boarded up windows of a lone vacant business, the still-gaping maw of the breach in the Columbia Canal or a little extra anxiety when the forecast calls for heavy rain. Thousands of new people have come to Columbia, either to stay or through a stint at job, a university or Fort Jackson. Many of them may not remember images of cars swept off once-familiar roadways or neighbors pulling each other from second-floor windows. But for those who lived through it, the memories of 2015 still linger, both the good and the bad. Months after the waters had receded, Brunson -- the former Forest Acres mayor -- was at a community event within earshot of a city park that had stayed mostly empty since the flood, he remembered. And for the first time since the waters rose, he could hear the sounds of children playing. ""I thought, 'Yeah, I think we made it. I think we got through this.'""

Silver Price: October Kicks Off with a 14-Year High for FXOPEN:XAGUSD by FXOpen,"Silver Price: October Kicks Off with a 14-Year High As the XAG/USD chart shows, today silver prices climbed above the $47.50 per ounce mark for the first time since 2011. Since the beginning of the month, silver has appreciated by approximately 15%. Why is silver rising? According to media reports, demand for so-called safe-haven assets has intensified amid the US government shutdown, which officially began on 1 October. President Trump has placed the blame on Democrats, while maintaining optimism that the shutdown could be leveraged to streamline the work of federal agencies. Trading Economics further highlights that the Silver Institute forecasts a deficit in the global silver market. Production is expected at 844 million ounces - around 100 million ounces short of demand, which continues to be driven by the expansion of solar energy, consumer electronics, and data centres. Technical analysis of the XAG/USD chart On 22 September, when analysing the XAG/USD chart, we: → Drew a long-term upward blue channel, along with a steeper orange channel indicating accelerated growth. → Noted that the silver price had broken above the upper boundary of the blue channel and suggested that XAG/USD was in a vulnerable position for a potential correction. Shortly thereafter (as shown by the red arrow), the price encountered resistance. However, it was insufficient to trigger a pullback, as the upper boundary of the blue channel acted as support (S), allowing silver to continue its ascent within the orange channel. Yesterday, when reviewing the gold chart, we noted a sharp decline in precious metals at the start of Monday's session. Although bulls managed to recover during the US session (signalling robust demand), bears remain present - underscored by today's failure to hold above Monday's high (marked by the black arrow). Applying any oscillator (such as RSI) will likely reveal signs of bearish divergence, pointing to a weakening bullish momentum. Taking the above into account, we could assume that: → The market remains bullish. While demand forces may be losing steam, the momentum of the rally could continue to play a significant role. → A correction is possible - for example, towards the lower boundary of the orange channel (S2), which is reinforced by a bullish FVG (an imbalance zone favouring buyers).

"U.S. Government Shutdown Returns: Gold Surges, Crypto Unmoved","The U.S. government has officially shut down after Congress failed to reach a funding deal - the first closure since 2018. The deadlock halts a wide range of federal programs, while essential services such as law enforcement, border protection, medical care, and air traffic control continue to operate. Markets reacted immediately. Gold futures broke above $3,900 per ounce for the first time in history as investors rushed into safe havens. The Kobeissi Letter warned that the shutdown ""would furlough 750,000 workers per day, costing ~$400 million in daily compensation."" Shutdowns are a recurring feature of U.S. politics. Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, though most lasted only a few days. The longest stretched 35 days during late 2018 under Donald Trump's 1st term, erasing billions in lost output. Historically, equity markets have absorbed shutdowns without lasting damage. Most tended to recover quickly. According to Kobeissi, 86% of shutdowns saw the S&P 500 trading higher a year later, with an average gain of 12.7%. In the short term, shutdowns often unsettle stocks. The S&P 500 ends higher only about 55% of the time once they conclude, but since 1995, every shutdown has eventually seen equities rebound into positive territory. Digital assets have largely shrugged off the turmoil. Bitcoin (BTC) hovered near $114,000, up 0.3% in 24 hours, while Ethereum (ETH) slipped 1.5% to $4,130. The total crypto market capitalization stands at $3.91 trillion, remaining largely unchanged despite the turmoil in Washington. However, trading volumes and prices in both traditional and digital markets can fluctuate during extended government shutdowns.

10 key takeaways from Tinubu's 65th Independence Day broadcast,"CHECK OUT: How to Start Earning with Copywriting in Just 7 Days - Even if You're a Complete Beginner President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during his 65th Independence Day broadcast on Wednesday, assured Nigerians that the country's hardest economic days are behind it. He said ongoing reforms are now yielding measurable results and urged citizens to remain hopeful. Here are ten things to note from the President's address: Tinubu announced that Nigeria's economy expanded by 4.23 percent in the second quarter of 2025, the fastest pace in four years. He added that inflation slowed to 20.12 percent in August, the lowest level since 2022. According to him, the removal of fuel subsidies and exchange rate reforms redirected funds into the productive economy. He listed agriculture and food security as key areas being strengthened to bring down costs for ordinary citizens. The President disclosed that Nigeria's external reserves had climbed to 42.03 billion dollars, the highest since 2019. He described this as proof of growing investor confidence and a sign that trade surpluses are returning. He said the debt service-to-revenue ratio had fallen from 97 percent in 2022 to below 50 percent. This, he explained, created room for more spending on health, education, infrastructure and social programmes. The administration has also paid down large central bank loans that once put pressure on the economy. Tinubu reported that crude oil output had recovered to 1.68 million barrels per day from barely one million in 2023. He attributed this to improved security in the Niger Delta and renewed investment in the sector. He further announced that Nigeria had resumed refining petrol locally for the first time in four decades. Aviation fuel exports have also placed the country ahead of peers on the continent. Major construction projects are moving forward, according to the President. These include the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and the Kano-Maradi rail line. He described them as projects that will connect regions, support jobs, and promote trade. Over 330 billion naira has been distributed to eight million households through the Social Investment Programme. Tinubu added that schemes such as YouthCred and Credicorp were giving loans to families and young Nigerians to expand opportunities. The President said the Nigerian Education Loan Fund had already supported more than 510,000 students across 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. He called it a milestone in broadening access to education, pointing out that both tuition fees and living allowances are now being covered. Tinubu stated that the armed forces are pushing back insurgents and bandits. In his words, displaced persons in the North-East and North-West are beginning to return home. He assured that the government remains committed to fully ending insecurity. The President spoke about the creativity of Nigerian youths, citing programmes such as iDICE, education loans, and creative industry funds. He urged young people to keep innovating and pursuing excellence in science, sports, technology and the arts. He said the government will continue to fund and support initiatives that give them ""wings to fly."" Tinubu closed his broadcast with a call for patriotism. He asked Nigerians to honour the vision of the nation's founding fathers by working together for unity and greatness. He also appealed to citizens to support local industries, pay taxes, and uphold civic duties. In a usual and traditional practice for the country's commander-in-chief, President Tinubu addressed the nation in the morning of Wednesday, October 1. Marking the 65th year since Nigeria secured its independence from colonial rule, Tinubu, in his lengthy speech, recounted the selfless efforts of past heroes who laid down their bodies and souls for the prosperity of the country.",Legit.ng - Nigeria news.,2025-10-01T09:24:46Z,https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1676571-10-key-takeaways-tinubus-65th-independence-day-broadcast/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.674962,0.1372549019607843

This company spent $35M designing next-gen hospital bed,"EDEN PRAIRIE, Minnesota -- Agiliti has invested more than $35 million to develop a next-generation hospital bed, one that fits the needs of all kinds of patients and the health care workers taking care of them. The company that rents and services hospital equipment has moved into manufacturing its own bed after years of handling models from other manufacturers. ""When you eat your own cooking, you tend to be a better chef,"" said Tom Leonard, Agiliti's chief executive, during a visit to the company's Eagan service center. After four years of development, $30 million in research costs and $5 million more in manufacturing upgrades, Agiliti is ready to introduce its Essentia bed. The Essentia name is a nod to essential workers (not the Duluth health system) and was designed to make a health care worker's life easier and less physically taxing while being more comfortable and therapeutic for patients. Post-COVID hospital staffing levels remain thin, and Agiliti sees a market for hospital equipment that can benefit patients while reducing physical stress on staff. So Agiliti built its bed frame to address the needs they consistently heard from customers and patients on adjustable bed height, side rails and mattress retainers. ""We brought that feedback together into one bed so customers don't have to rent different beds that operate differently for different reasons,"" said Kristen Thurman, vice president of product management and clinical affairs at Agiliti. The Essentia bed and related accessories should be a major financial driver for the $1.2 billion company for years to come. ""Our success here is not just critical to the financial future of the business,"" Leonard said. ""I don't expect that this is the last product that we will manufacture."" Razor blade business model The Essentia bed was the direct result of manufacturing capability Agiliti got from its $230 million acquisition of Sizewise in 2021. Sizewise is a maker of hospital beds specializing in oversize frames and surfaces for the bariatric market. Leonard thinks of a hospital bed using the razor and razor-blade business model. The bed frame is the durable product and the surfaces (mattresses) are the replaceable items that pair with a frame. Depending on use, a hospital bed frame can last 10 years, while surfaces can last three to seven years. According to Leonard, the health care industry buys about 50,000 to 70,000 new hospital beds annually. Last year that was about a $2.5 billion market in the United States. Agiliti didn't disclose the purchase price of the Essentia bed, which is just now reaching the market after 1,000 patient days of final evaluation. Hospital beds from makers like Hillrom, SonderCare, Stryker and others can range from $2,000 to well over $10,000. The Essentia bed frames are being built in Kansas, and the surfaces are being built in California. The company also has some manufacturing capability in Mexico. According to Leonard, Agiliti made the decision to manufacture in the U.S. years ago, which has provided the company some advantages. ""We have very little impact today from the vacillations on tariffs,"" Leonard said. ""There's some things we have to source (internationally), but very little."" A decade of growth Leonard joined Agiliti in 2015 when the company was called Universal Hospital Services. At the time it had about $400 million in annual revenue, mainly from rental income, but was financially troubled. Under Leonard, the company added more maintenance and management services, expanded geographically and increased employment from 2,300 to nearly 6,000. ""We've done that not by trying to cut our way to success, but rather by investing in our growth,"" Leonard said. The firm changed its name to Agiliti in 2018. Agiliti had 2024 revenue of $1.2 billion; according to Leonard, about 30% of the revenue was associated with managing hospital beds, which includes the frames and mattresses. The company's growth also came while transitioning though private equity owners and a brief run as a publicly traded company. The company is currently owned by an affiliate of the private equity company Thomas H. Lee Partners. Agiliti owns or manages more than a million pieces of health care equipment, including beds, surgical equipment and stockpiles of emergency equipment for state and federal governments. Today more than 90% of hospitals in the United States are within 100 miles of one of Agiliti's more than 130 U.S. service centers that clean, maintain, inspect, repair and deploy hospital equipment through a fleet of more than 1,700 vehicles. The service center in Eagan opened in April 2024. At 32,000 square feet, it's among the larger Agiliti sites. Open 24/7, it employs about 35 people, maintains approximately 2,000 to 2,500 pieces of medical equipment in the facility and is responsible for about 5,000 additional pieces deployed in approximately 150 nearby hospitals, surgery centers or other health care facilities. Built from experience Agiliti has been one of the biggest purchasers of hospital beds from other manufacturers. As it serviced those beds over the years, the company got plenty of feedback on what worked and what didn't. The Essentia bed has a number of features to benefit both patients and caregivers. It's an integrated system with a frame that can accommodate different surfaces/mattresses meant for different types of patients. Those mattresses and surfaces can help prevent pressure wounds (bedsores) and help regulate body temperature to make sleep more comfortable. The frame itself can be lowered to a height of 11½ inches, which allows patients to sit on the edge of the bed and place their feet securely on the floor. The length and width of the frame are also adjustable. Bed rails are easily positioned to help patients steady themselves, but the rails can also easily move out of the way so staff can attend to patients without reaching. The main functions of the bed can be accessed at the foot of the bed and from either side. Menu functions are intuitive, the company says, and the various alarms and alerts associated with the bed are customizable. One of the bed's most unusual features addresses today's care procedures, which aim to get nearly all patients moving or at least in weight-bearing positions as soon as practical. The Essentia bed can tilt up to 20 degrees, higher than competitors. That tilt puts even the most immobile patients in weight-bearing positions that aid in recovery, and also helps prevent pressure sores. ""The more they can mobilize, the less pressure injuries they're going to get,"" said VP Thurman.",ArcaMax,2025-10-01T09:24:35Z,https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-3869870,2025-10-01 17:26:52.676172,0.2705882352941176
Tinubu lists 3 loan opportunities available for Nigerian youths under his administration,"CHECK OUT: Don't let unemployment hold you back. Start your digital marketing journey today. President Bola Tinubu has reiterated that Nigerian youths remain centred to his administration, adding that his government is making everything possible to make life better for all Nigerians and affirming that the youths are ""the future and the greatest assets of this blessed country."" The president made this assertion in his nationwide address to Nigerians in commemoration of the 65th Independence Day of the country in the early hours of Wednesday, October 1. In the address, the president urged the youths to ""continue to dream big, innovate, and conquer more territories in your various fields of science, technology, sports, and the art and creative sector."" He vowed that his administration will continue to support the youth in every area where support is needed, including funding. He then cited three loan schemes available for the youths under his administration. The development came amid the criticism against President Tinubu's economic policies, particularly since the removal of the fuel subsidy and the unification of the country's currency. According to the president, the loan schemes are: Tinubu explained that his administration created NELFUND to support Nigerian students' loans in their educational careers. According to the president, 510,000 students in 228 higher institutions in the 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have benefited from the scheme. He further explained that a total of N99.5 billion has been disbursed as loans to students, while the beneficiaries have also received ""the upkeep allowance,"" which stood at N44.7 billion. The president also disclosed that Credicorp was an initiative of his administration, and no less than 153,000 Nigerians have benefited from N30 billion affordable loans that have been distributed so far. Credicorp is a loan given by the government to interested Nigerians to buy vehicles, solar energy, digital services, home upgrades and several others. President Tinubu said in his nationwide broadcast that he promised on the June 12 broadcast to introduce YouthCred, adding that the promise is now a reality today. The president explained that tens of thousands of the National Youth Service Corps members are now actively benefiting from the consumer credit for resettlement.

How you are subsidising Ryanair and Aer Lingus,"Every cent that comes off the passenger charges paid by the airlines has to be recouped from the tills in Dublin Airport The DAA, which operates Dublin and Cork airports, availed of its interim results announcement to kick-start its campaign to increase the fees it charges airlines to use its airports. Looking past its interim pretax profit of €77.8 million, the group pointed towards ""sustained cost pressures, from energy and regulatory compliance to construction and wage inflation"" and thus the need to increase charges in order to maintain services and invest in facilities. The airport's two biggest customers, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, were quick out of the traps in response. Aer Lingus said the DAA had made ""very significant profits in recent years despite repeatedly claiming that airport charges are too low"". Ryanair was a little more trenchant, claiming the airport operator had ""the same attitude to the truth as Donald Trump"" before adding that ""their claims about unsustainably low charges and/or charges being among the lowest in Europe are false"", claiming it is instead ""already one of Europe's most expensive"". What gets lost in all the noise around airport charges is how much money the DAA extracts from passengers to effectively subsidise airlines. If your commercial revenues per passenger are at the upper end of the scale and your aeronautical revenues per passenger are at the lower end of the scale - as is the case with Dublin Airport - it's pretty clear who is contributing to your profits and who isn't. Dublin Airport charges airlines between €12.70 and €3.25 per departing passenger depending on the time of year and whether the airline is using an air bridge or making its customers walk up and down a set of stairs from the tarmac. Ryanair adopts the latter model while Aer Lingus uses a mixture. According to the Irish Aviation Authority - which sets these charges - Dublin Airport makes revenues of €22.64 per passenger, which is just above the midpoint for the airports that it tracks for comparison purposes. The figure is split between aeronautical revenue (passenger charges and so on paid by airlines) and commercial revenues (such as parking and shopping, paid by you). Dublin Airport's aeronautical revenues were €9.33 per passenger last year. This is less than the average of €13.44 for the airports tracked by the IAA. However, Dublin Airport's commercial revenue per passenger of €11.13 ranks towards the upper end of the airports tracked by the IAA (average of €8.64), according to the DAA. More of that later, but first there is the issue as to whether airlines are being overcharged. Ryanair's average airport and handling charge per passenger across its network was €8.41 in the year to March. This is almost a euro less than the average for Dublin. The IAA believes that Ryanair's true cost per passenger is even lower. This is certainly suggested by its fares. As of this week you can go on Ryanair's website and find flights advertised for low double-digit prices. They are offering flights from Dublin to Liverpool for €14.99 and to Fuerteventura for €19.99. If Ryanair's airport and handling charges were €8.41 it would have to be losing money on those fares (although the situation improves after they hit passengers up for baggage charges and overpriced toasties). Aer Lingus does not disclose its costs but told the IAA that Dublin's average airport charge per passenger is ""mid-range"" compared to the other European airports that it operates to and from. Aer Lingus will fly you to Birmingham or Manchester for €26.60. You can argue, based on the IAA figures, that there is room for some reduction in airport charges in Dublin although you are not necessarily comparing apples with apples. The cost of operating an airport is a function of its input costs such as energy and labour, which are higher here than elsewhere. You cannot blame the airlines for trying but you have to factor the DAA's cost base into the equation. It is harder to argue that a reduction is justified. We all blindly accept that everything at the airport - from car parking to sandwiches - is more expensive when in truth there really is no reason why it should be. In so far as most of us think about it, we assume there is some sort of extra cost involved. But what we don't realise is that those costs are in effect the DAA subsiding the likes of Ryanair and Aer Lingus and passing this on to you. Unless the DAA wants to go bust, which we presume it doesn't, then every cent that comes off the passenger charges paid by the airline has to be recouped from the tills in Dublin Airport. The two airlines would be better off doing their negotiating in private lest the penny drop with the travelling public as to who is picking up the tab for lower airport charges. Likewise, if the DAA gets its increase it might want to think about passing some of it on to the travelling public.",The Irish Times,2025-10-01T05:00:01Z,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/01/how-you-are-subsidising-ryanair-and-aer-lingus/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.677274,0.06666666666666665

Innovation must permeate all aspects of society: Party chief,"Hanoi (VNA) - Innovation must be spread and deeply embedded across social life, in State-owned economic sectors and in the creation of institutions ensuring fairness, protecting intellectual property and promoting digital infrastructure investment, paving the way for breakthroughs that bring new value or resolve longstanding issues. The statement was made by Party General Secretary To Lam while addressing a national event in Hanoi on October 1 in response to the National Innovation Day 2025. The Party chief emphasised that science, technology and innovation (STI) and digital transformation are essential breakthroughs for reshaping the country's development model and achieving its dual goals - becoming an upper-middle-income developing country by 2030 and a high-income developed nation by 2045. He described this not just as a strategic need but a command of the times that will define the nation's position in the coming decades. Innovation, he stressed, must be embraced as a collective mission - not the sole responsibility of scientists or a specific ministry. From public administration to business operations and everyday life, every citizen, enterprise, and government body must adopt a culture of innovation. General Secretary Lam highlighted major policies to promote innovation and their positive results. However, he also pointed to limitations in innovation activities, while many policies have yet to catch up with the growth pace of technology. He called for greater visibility and celebration of inventions, improvements, and creative initiatives across sectors -- from streamlined business processes to critical thinking in schools and digital skills in society. The media, he noted, plays a key role in amplifying these stories, helping make innovation a driver for national development. The General Secretary urged swift implementation of strategic tech programmes under Resolution 57, development of digital infrastructure, increased localisation of key technologies, and enhanced readiness for global integration. Vietnam, he said, must design robust legal and institutional frameworks to support STI, focusing on tax incentives, credit, land use policies, intellectual property protections, and sandbox legal environments for emerging technologies. Each ministry, province, and city was tasked with establishing at least one innovation hub connected to research centres, incubators, legal advisory networks, angel investors, venture capital, and domestic and international markets. He also called for deeper engagement with overseas Vietnamese and global experts to leapfrog in knowledge and technology. General Secretary Lam further called on universities and research institutes to step up technology transfer and enable the commercialisation of research through spin-off companies. He noted that all innovations must solve social problems, increase productivity while reducing emissions, expand coverage but ensure data safety, grow rapidly without leaving anyone behind. Innovation is not a destination but an iterative improvement process without end. It begins with the spirit of daring to think extraordinarily, do the hardest things, shoulder responsibility before the people and history, and break through to open new paths uncharted by others, he stressed. He called on all officials, civil servants, workers, farmers, engineers, teachers, doctors, armed forces personnel, elderly, students, and Vietnamese people at home and abroad to uphold patriotism and continuously embrace innovation in their daily work. At the ceremony, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh requested ministries, agencies, units, localities, businesses, and individuals to effectively implement the six tasks assigned by the Party chief. He highlighted the principle of ""three nos"" - no hesitation or empty promises; no perfectionism or haste; and no barriers in innovative thinking and action. He also called for ""three forms of support"" from international partners - technical assistance in policymaking and infrastructure; financial aid and technology transfer, especially in strategic sectors; and support for Vietnamese tech start-ups to access global markets and supply chains. To the youth, the Government leader issued a rallying cry for ""three pioneering actions"" - to lead in innovation and digital transformation; to break through personal limits with continual creativity; and to race against time with determination and boldness. At the event, organisers unveiled the Provincial Innovation Index (PII) 2025, alongside new nationwide programmes launched by businesses, universities and international organisations. The ceremony concluded with General Secretary Lam, PM Chinh and delegates launching the Vietnam Innovation Day 2025 and opening the Vietnam International Innovation Exhibition 2025./.

Editor's Column: When the floodwaters came,"Zoe Nicholson is the editor of Free Times, covering culture and city life. She is a South Carolina native and graduate of the University of South Carolina. She has previously covered higher education, local government, business and education in the South. What I remember from the 2015 flood were the water bottles. They clogged up my dorm room for months. I was a freshman at the University of South Carolina, and my mom -- ever the at-home meteorologist -- urged my sister and me to come home that Sunday. We drove back to Greer, a few friends in tow, and watched from afar as the rain kept coming, the water rose and Columbia was forever changed. As the city swam out of the wreckage, I confess I was so far removed from the incident that I treated it like another fall break. When I got back to campus, I mostly remember all of the water bottles the dorm staff pushed on me -- I showered with it, brushed my teeth with it, clutched it at night like a teddy bear. I remember the truckloads of supplies that came in from other SEC schools, and the almost triumphant football game at LSU that came shortly after the flood. But my experience was limited to what an 18-year-old college student might take away from that time, so last week I asked around the Free Times office. Sales representative Angie Bledsoe was working out of the Free Times' Main Street offices at the time. She recalls a ping pong table full of water bottles and a frantic few days. ""There were so many places where you'd turn the corner and it would be devastated,"" she said of Columbia in the days following the rains. ""Then you turn another corner and it was totally normal."" Publisher Bernie Heller was living in Irmo at the time. A few of his close friends lost everything in the floods, which claimed the lives of 19 South Carolinians. He still remembers ""the amount of stress and sadness that was all over them,"" he told me. ""It was a really scary time."" It's been a decade since the rains brought the floodwaters. And a year since Hurricane Helene carved a deadly path through the Carolinas. Some lessons we learned. Others, I fear, we're fated to repeat.",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/free-times/opinion/editors-column-2015-flood-columbia-sc/article_bc92b9dc-89c9-4dc8-b4d6-31f175e7a0c2.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.678518,0.2156862745098038
A generational blessing as an Empangeni man bags R69m in Powerball,"The man expressed heartfelt relief that his children will now have the peace of mind to pursue their dreams without being rushed into adult responsibilities. Image: 123RF/tawhy An Empangeni father who has bagged R69m in the Powerball Plus jackpot said his newfound wealth is more than just financial freedom, it's a generational blessing. ""The burden of children having to take care of their parents while they only start attending to their own basic needs later in life ends with me. In my 50s, my wife and I have been raising our children in a rented home all our lives. Now, we can finally own a home of our own, and I want to make sure my children will also have houses once they complete their studies and start working,"" said the winner. Ithuba announced that the man claimed his total winnings from the September 23 draw with a ticket purchased in-store in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, with a R45 wager and manual selection. The winner, a devoted husband and father in his 50s, said he was still overwhelmed by the reality of his new fortune. ""I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. To think that I would one day see so many zeros in my bank account, it still feels like a dream,"" he said. The man expressed heartfelt relief that his children will now have the peace of mind to pursue their dreams without being rushed into adult responsibilities. ""They must have the freedom to build the lives they want without the weight of providing for us, like I had to. Education will be their foundation, and I'll make sure of that,"" he said. He also plans to take his mother, who is more than 80, to a hotel. ""There is nothing more I can do for her now, but one thing I've always wished for is to take her to a five-star hotel. She deserves that experience, and I know she will love it,"" he said. He also plans to travel with his wife. ""We will start local, exploring South Africa and then gradually travel internationally. But we will only do this from the interest earned on investments. I am going to take care of these winnings. They are a blessing for my family, and I must preserve them."" Despite his newfound wealth, the man intends to continue working. Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza congratulated the winner. ""This is such a heart-warming story. We are thrilled to see the PowerBall Plus jackpot transforming lives in such a meaningful way.

Advisor Glass Lewis backs Cenovus bid for MEG Energy,"On Tuesday, Glass Lewis lined up with rival advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and endorsed Cenovus' cash-and-share offer for its next door neighbour in Alberta's oil sands. MEG shareholders are scheduled to vote on the takeover October 9. ""We place significant weight on the certainty of value offered by Cenovus' cash-heavy structure, the absence of financing conditions and the higher probability of timely closing, as well as the reduced governance and liquidity risks as compared to Strathcona,"" said Glass Lewis in a report. ""We recommend that [MEG] shareholders vote for the proposed plan of arrangement with Cenovus,"" said the proxy advisor. Cenovus is offering $27.25 in cash and 1.325 of its own shares for each MEG share, while Strathcona is offering 0.8 of its shares for each MEG share. All three Calgary-based companies operate large properties near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Glass Lewis and ISS have significant influence with index funds and other passive investors. These shareholders rely on the adviser firms' voting recommendations and sometimes determine the winners of contested takeovers. Last Friday, ISS said Cenovus' offer deserved ""cautionary support"" from MEG shareholders. In May, Strathcona put MEG in play by going public with an unsolicited bid for the company. MEG's board responded by running a sales process that resulted in an agreement with Cenovus in August. In September, MEG's board of directors backed the Cenovus offer over an improved bid from Strathcona. Over the past four months, MEG's board refused to engage with Strathcona because its suitor declined to sign a standstill agreement that other bidders agreed to. Strathcona executive chair Adam Waterous said the MEG board ran a flawed process that failed to get the best possible offers for the company. On Tuesday, Glass Lewis said: ""While we believe MEG's board may have engaged Strathcona more constructively - potentially levering up the competitive interest - we don't find the board's process to be a failed effort, as portrayed by Strathcona."" Glass Lewis said both the Cenovus and Strathcona bids are ""credible but cater to different shareholder preferences. Cenovus offered MEG's owners greater certainty and a cash component, while Glass Lewis said Strathcona's bid ""offered a higher headline value at announcement and greater long-term participation.""",The Globe and Mail,2025-10-01T09:24:11Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-glass-lewis-cenovus-meg-energy-strathcona-oil-sands-takeover-alberta/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.679328,0.3647058823529412
Campaign Warns Solicitors and House Buyers of Payment Diversion Fraud,"UK house buyers hit with payment diversion fraud (PDF) have suffered average losses of £82,000 over the past year, a new awareness campaign has warned. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has teamed up with The Law Society to urge solicitors and conveyancers to scrutinize payments more carefully. PDF is a type of business email compromise (BEC) in which threat actors impersonate a trusted entity such as a solicitor, conveyancer or estate agent. The goal is to trick house buyers into sending them deposit funds or the balance of payments when completing a purchase. Given the large sums involved in such purchases, the impact can be devastating for those defrauded. The NCA claimed that victims lose millions of pounds each year to this type of fraud. on BEC: Business Email Compromise Costs $55bn Over a Decade From a technical perspective, the fraudster usually either hijacks a legitimate email account or spoofs it with a lookalike domain, before sending victims an invoice with updated bank transfer details. ""Average losses when this happens during a property sale are more than £80,000. That is a life changing sum to lose for most people - but it also does enormous harm to the trust and faith that people place in the legal and financial systems that they rely on,"" said Nick Sharp, deputy director fraud at the NCA's National Economic Crime Centre (NECC). ""That is why the NCA is actively targeting and disrupting the criminal networks behind payment diversion fraud through investigations and intelligence sharing with international partners. However, prevention remains equally as important as disruptions."" The NCA had the following advice for solicitors and conveyancers: The NCA also urged house buyers to reduce PDF risks by only transferring small fund amounts initially, and checking if they have been received before proceeding. It added that they should always check bank details directly with their solicitor. ""This campaign with The Law Society represents a vital part of our strategy - by raising awareness and strengthening defences within the law sector, we can significantly reduce opportunities for criminals to succeed,"" Sharp concluded. ""Solicitors and conveyancers are the first line of defense in protecting both themselves and their clients from becoming victims.""",Infosecurity Magazine,2025-10-01T09:24:36Z,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/solicitors-house-buyers-payment/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.679629,-0.5529411764705883

NVDA 5 trln USD market cap up next? Key fundamentals and upside. for NASDAQ:NVDA by ProjectSyndicate,"Is $5T reasonable for NVDA? * Mechanically, yes: The market only needs ~10% near-term appreciation from today's levels to print $5T. That's within one strong quarter or a guidance beat. * Fundamentally, the math works if (a) FY26-27 revenue tracks the guide/Street trajectory (TTM already $165B with Q3 guide $54B), (b) non-GAAP GMs hover low-to-mid-70s, and (c) opex discipline holds. Under those, forward EPS path supports ~35× at $5T, a premium but not outlandish for a category-defining compute platform. * Free-cash optionality: With ~$48B net cash and massive FCF, NVDA can keep funding buybacks (already $60B fresh authorization) and capacity, smoothing cycles. ________________________________________ * Stock price at $5T market cap: ≈ $205.8 per share (on ~24.3B shares). * Gain needed from $186.6: +$19.2 (~+10.3%). The quick math (market cap ⇒ price) * Shares outstanding (basic): ~24.3 B (as of Aug 22, 2025, per 10-Q). * Stock @ $5T market cap: $5,000,000,000,000 ÷ 24.3B ≈ $205.8/share. * From today's price $186.6: needs +$19.2 or ~+10.3%. That also implies P/E (TTM) at $5T of roughly ~56× (using TTM EPS ~3.68). Today's trailing P/E is ~50-53× depending on feed. ________________________________________ Core fundamentals snapshot 🧩 Latest quarter (Q2 FY26, reported Aug 27, 2025) * Revenue: $46.7B (+56% y/y; +6% q/q). * Data Center revenue: $41.1B (+56% y/y). * GAAP gross margin: 72.4%; non-GAAP 72.7%; Q3 guide ~73.3-73.5%. * GAAP EPS: $1.08 (non-GAAP: $1.05; excl. $180M inventory release: $1.04). TTM scale & profitability * Revenue (TTM): ~$165.2B. * Net income (TTM): ~$86.6B. * Diluted EPS (TTM): ~$3.5-3.7. * Cash & marketable securities: $56.8B; debt: ~$8.5-10.6B ⇒ net cash ≈ $48B. Capital returns * $24.3B returned in 1H FY26; new $60B buyback authorization (no expiration). Remaining buyback capacity ~$71B as of Aug 26. ________________________________________ Valuation read (today vs. $5T) Using widely watched metrics: * P/E (TTM): ~50-53× today; at $5T it rises to ~56× (assuming flat TTM EPS). * Forward P/E: Street FY27 EPS ≈ $5.91 → ~31-33× today; ~35× at $5T -- still below many AI hyper-growth narratives that trade at 40-50× forward when growth visibility is high. * EV/EBITDA (TTM): EV ≈ market cap - net cash. Today EV ~$4.45T; EBITDA TTM ≈ $98-103B ⇒ EV/EBITDA ~43-45×; at $5T EV/EBITDA drifts to ~48-50×. * P/S (TTM): ~27× today (at $4.5T) and ~30× at $5T on $165.2B TTM revenue. * FCF yield: TTM FCF range $60.9-72.0B ⇒ ~1.35-1.60% today; ~1.22-1.44% at $5T. Takeaway: $5T doesn't require a heroic repricing -- it's ~10% above spot and implies ~35× forward earnings if consensus holds. That's rich vs. the S&P (~22.5× forward) but arguably reasonable given NVDA's growth, margins, and quasi-platform status in AI compute. ________________________________________ What must be true to justify $5T (and beyond) ✅ 1. AI capex ""supercycle"" persists/expands. Citi now models $490B hyperscaler AI capex in 2026 (up from $420B) and trillions through 2029-30. A sustained 40-50% NVDA wallet share across compute+networking underwrites revenue momentum and margin sustainment. 2. Annual product cadence holds. Blackwell today → Rubin in 2026 with higher power & bandwidth, widening the perf gap vs. AMD MI450 -- supports pricing power and mix. 3. Margins stay ""mid-70s"" non-GAAP. Company guides ~73.3-73.5% near term; sustaining 70%+ through transitions offsets any unit price compression. 4. Networking, software & systems scale. NVLink/Spectrum, NVL systems and CUDA/Enterprise subscriptions deepen the moat and smooth cyclicality; attach expands TAM (improves EV/EBITDA vs. pure-GPU lens). 5.

North Charleston aerospace parts maker to invest $43M and beef up its payroll,"Eaton Aerospace LLC is expanding its North Charleston operations for the second time since 2013. A global manufacturer of aerospace components is investing about $43 million and adding 53 jobs in a customer-fueled expansion of its North Charleston operation. Eaton Corp. announced Sept. 30 that it plans to build a 60,000-square-foot plant next to its longtime existing factory at 7230 Cross County Road to make hydraulic pumps and motors. The parts are ""used on nearly every major aircraft today,"" according to a Charleston County Council document. Eaton said the investment will partly support a recent, unidentified ""program win"" for the manufacturer. It also will give the company extra capacity to take on new business. The new jobs will pay an average of $46 per hour, or $97,632 a year, boosting Eaton's existing local payroll by about $5.14 million, the S.C. Commerce Department said. The capital investment will be split roughly between property improvements and equipment The second plant is expected to ramp up operations starting in 2028. ""The expansion ... will enable Eaton to add machining, assembly and test capabilities and expand our existing additive manufacturing capability to support a key customer's accelerated delivery schedule on a new program win,"" company executive Armando Tellez said in a written statement. The manufacturer considered about six of its other sites for the investment, according to Merle Johnson, Charleston County's economic development director. The expansion is expected to generate about $11.7 million for government agencies over the next 20 years under an agreement that replaces Eaton's property tax bill with a flat fee. Also, up to $2.3 million in state tax credits and government grants have been approved for the company to help pay for infrastructure upgrades and construction costs tied to the project. County Council's finance committee approved the incentive package last month. At the time, Eaton was identified by the code name ""Project Modern."" The property tax break still must be finalized. County Council will hold a public hearing on the fee agreement on Oct. 14 at 6:30 p.m. The North Charleston plant is part of Eaton's aerospace division, a global supplier of mechanical, hydraulic and air-driven components that flight crews need to safely and easily control and operate aircraft. The company has stated previously that it makes pumps and valves for Boeing Co.'s locally based 787 Dreamliner program, which is investing $1 billion to raise its production rate to 10 planes a month from seven. Eaton Aerospace LLC acquired its 14-acre Cross County Road property in 1999 through its purchase of Aeroquip-Vickers Inc., an Ohio company that made high-precision metal parts at the North Charleston site.",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/business/industry/north-charleston-aerospace-parts-maker-to-invest-43m-and-beef-up-its-payroll/article_204c19cf-e21a-485a-80ed-26176a35433a.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.680931,0.192156862745098
Brittany Ferries celebrating six months of 'massive growth',"The company has celebrated 'massive growth' on all routes and chief executive Christophe Mathieu has described the year as 'very positive'. Six months of operation under the new contract passed at the weekend. 'We have fully dedicated ourselves to make it successful, but we were also greatly helped and assisted by the people in Guernsey. The numbers speak for themselves,' he said. 'I think we are a little bit above our expectation, especially when it comes to this southern route, and the numbers of French people visiting Guernsey by foot. 'Not all, because even on the car passenger side, it's a significant growth over last year. 'But the big boom - the one that I think we had not quite expected the volume of - is those day trips to Guernsey, which is great because, from what I understand and I've been told many times, it really brings a different atmosphere in the island. 'It's great because at the end of the day we're talking about exchanges, connections between people and people visiting each other and understanding the culture better. 'Guernsey is such an interesting place because at the end of the day it's that British spirit, but with a lot of French history, and Victor Hugo, of course, being the main icon or topic. 'So it's above expectations, and we look forward now to carry on working with the States of Guernsey to improve, develop, strengthen and consolidate everything that has started so well this season.' Mr Mathieu said that freight services had also gone well. 'I think everybody is happy because I think we've organised the best we could, given the schedule and one-ship operation.' Although there were concerns about how a ferry operator could sustain a single island service at the time of the collapse of the pan-island ferry tender, Mr Mathieu said its operation, using just the Voyager and Islander ferries, with consistent sailing times, had worked out well. 'The schedule works okay. Of course you could always do more because the ships are not full in absolute terms, but they're never full in absolute terms anywhere in Brittany Ferries. But we are happy with two ships running this operation, and remember, we're going to build on this more and more. 'Things take time, but we also build on more in putting Guernsey as part of our destination map, to cross-sell more Guernsey with France, if you are Brits; Guernsey with Britain, if you are French. We're also trying to make Guernsey more integrated to our destinations at Brittany Ferries. 'So there's plenty of things to do to capitalise and develop further. And of course, we are also depending on the dynamism of the Guernsey economy and on some projects that could happen for the freight and all of that. 'We will always be there to assist and to bring everything that is required on the island. We have an extensive network of contacts and we want to make sure Guernsey gets connected in Brittany because it seems like it's a long-term mutual benefit for the island. 'At the end of the day, as an island, you are almost equidistant from the UK and France. If you make the most of both, that must be, of course, to your benefit. 'It seems as though the States of Guernsey needs or wants to open up more to France, which would be absolutely great. 'We're there to help, and it's part of our DNA to assist them in doing all of that.'",Guernsey Press,2025-10-01T09:24:26Z,https://guernseypress.com/news/2025/10/01/brittany-ferries-celebrating-six-months-of-massive-growth,2025-10-01 17:26:52.681342,0.4352941176470588
Gold top ? for FX_IDC:XAUUSD by PlanBillions,"Wanted to look into XAUUSD to see if/when I could short. Cup and handle target is blown cuz that would've been @ 3100. Now looking at $4000 cuz, come on, who isn't, it's gotta be a psychological target/resistance. So I threw a fibonacci ahead of the price from the breakout and retest low, @ 2000, and targeted 4000. Everything lined up pretty well! Got to looking at it and playing with it, and lined up all the key levels in the fib to the chart where we actually got good signs of resistance (on the weekly). Every level is respected with the target set just above current price @ about 3913! Just the 50% is rejected and supported very quickly and almost precisely at $2955 which makes sense leaving a lot of liquidity through the 0.5-0.618 area for a retrace and bounce! Will be looking for some confirmations and still looking to see if we wick to 3950/4000! (I feel like I've noticed gold likes to do the $50's for some reason) Check it out! I do expect some serious volatility once we do reach the top which is why I'm interested in a short and a quick payday! Lol! But the fib does line up, just not quite as perfect, with a start at $1820 and a target of 4500 so we'll see !",TradingView,2025-10-01T09:15:41Z,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/seEgsF8q-Gold-top/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.681516,0.1843137254901961
Oil giant Shell raises eyebrows after rolling out unexpected new tech: 'Seeing the inevitable',"In yet another sign that electric vehicles are the wave of the future, the latest innovation in charging technology has come from an unexpected source: an oil company. Shell Lubricants, a division of the Shell Oil Company, has created a breakthrough new thermal management fluid for use in EVs, according to New Atlas. While that might sound like something that requires a degree in chemistry to understand, the end result is simple: faster charging times. But just how much faster? Shell has claimed that its fluid allows EVs to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in about 10 minutes, per New Atlas. Several challenges have confronted experts looking for ways to charge EVs faster. Namely, fast charging can compromise safety and potentially shorten a battery's lifespan. According to a statement by Shell, the company ""has successfully formulated and demonstrated a high-performance EV thermal management fluid with the ability to unlock significant reductions in charging times without compromise to battery safety, thermal stability or lifespan, aiding the widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles."" In the comment section of the New Atlas article, readers expressed mixed views on the announcement. ""This is great news,"" said one commenter. ""I'm impressed that even oil companies are seeing the inevitable (and profitable) future."" Others were more skeptical. ""It's probably a consumable,"" another commenter wrote. ""EVs will take over, but now you'll need to go to Shell to get your 'battery gas.'"" While companies can change, consumers have plenty of reasons to be wary of Shell based on the company's checkered history. For example, a Shell subsidiary operating in Nigeria has faced years of litigation over allegations that, in 2008, two of the company's pipelines leaked oil into local waterways for five straight weeks. Last summer, a Nigerian monarch demanded that the company pay billions in reparations before shutting down operations in the country. While EVs do have an environmental cost, research shows that their cradle-to-grave environmental impact is far less than that of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. For example, while the world still generates much of its electricity from burning dirtier, nonrenewable fuels like coal and natural gas, an EV charged off the average American power grid still is only responsible for as much heat-trapping pollution as a gas-powered car getting 100 miles per gallon, according to MIT Climate Portal. To push the environmental benefits of driving an EV even further, and to save money on electricity, you can charge your EV with home solar. Doing so is cheaper than charging off the grid or at a public charging station, while also giving you the added satisfaction of knowing your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun. If upgrading to home solar feels overwhelming, EnergySage can help with free, easy-to-use online tools that allow you to compare quotes among vetted local installers while also making sure that you take maximum advantage of government rebates and other incentives available in your state. However, federal EV tax credits shuttered Sept. 30. With tax credits for solar expiring Dec. 31, this is your last chance to act if you want to take advantage of the thousands of dollars in potential savings.",The Cool Down,2025-10-01T09:15:00Z,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/shell-thermal-management-fluid-evs-charging/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.682023,0.2784313725490195
"Tesla sees first monthly sales growth in France, Denmark in 2025 | News.az","Tesla has struggled in Europe this year as its small, ageing model lineup has faced growing competition from EVs launched by European and Chinese rivals. The U.S. company has not released a new mass-market model since the Model Y in 2020. Tesla's competitive problems have been compounded by a backlash by some consumers against its CEO Elon Musk, who helped bankroll Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory last year and has championed European far-right parties. Tesla has argued that its revamped Model Y, which it began delivering in many European markets in June, would lead a recovery in European sales. For January-August, Tesla's sales were down 42.9% year-on-year in the European Union and down 32.6% in Europe as a whole. China's BYD outsold Tesla in the EU in August for the second time this year. But in September, Tesla reported a 2.74% annual increase in sales in France and a 20.5% rise in Denmark. In Norway, Tesla's registrations were up 14.7%, with its Model Y and Model 3 taking the top two spots for sales. But in Sweden, which was Tesla's worst-performing market in Europe in the first eight months of the year, its registrations fell 64% to 1,726 cars, although that was up sharply from the 210 cars it registered there in August.",News.az,2025-10-01T09:24:05Z,https://news.az/news/tesla-sees-first-monthly-sales-growth-in-france-denmark-in-2025,2025-10-01 17:26:52.682286,0.05882352941176472
"This year's Thanksgiving turkey will cost you less in Ontario, but you'll be paying more for these items","Your Thanksgiving feast might cost you a bit more than it did last year. You most likely won't have to break the bank for your bird, but making a whole meal for four people will actually cost you just a few cents more than it did last year. This year, Thanksgiving arrives on Monday, Oct. 13, so there's still time to stock up on supper staples. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Turkey, potatoes and more According to the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, a seven-pound frozen turkey will cost you less than it did in 2024, with the cost at checkout approximately $10.43, compared to $11.69 last year. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW But that savings will be blown if you add in a 10-pound bag of potatoes, which has gone up a dollar, to $6.99 this year. Spuds represent ""one of the biggest jumps in the basket,"" senior director Sylvain Charlebois said in a media release. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Looking at national chain grocery store flyers across Canada for the last week of September, Charlebois and his team estimated how much a turkey dinner would be. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW He noted a marginal increase of 18 cents total for this year's dinner for four. ""Grocers appear to be discounting some staples like turkey while allowing increases on side dishes,"" Charlebois said. Other items that increased modestly were gravy (up by 39 cents), stuffing (up 42 cents), cranberries (up 50 cents) and bread rolls (up one cent). Carrots overall are cheaper per pound this fall, from $1.79 in 2024 to 91 cents today. ""Thanksgiving dinner is a powerful symbol for Canadian households, and its cost gives us insight into broader food price dynamics,"" Charlebois said. ""This year, Canadians are paying almost the same as last year. Turkey and carrots are cheaper, but potatoes and packaged goods are driving modest increases. The bottom line: the holiday meal is stable in cost, but households are seeing a shift in where the money goes."" Tariffs on steel making their way to your plate ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Charlebois also noted tariffs are having an impact. ""Tariffs on steel and aluminum continue to influence the cost of canned goods, such as cranberry sauce and gravy,"" he said. ""While this year's promotions softened some of the increases, tariffs create ongoing upward pressure."" Other root vegetables If you're considering slimming your budget, you may want to consider a few other side dishes this year. According to Statistics Canada, rutabagas were Canada's fifth most important root vegetable in terms of sales for 2023, following potatoes, onions, carrots and fresh french shallots and green onions. Farm gate sales of $31.6 million for rutabagas in 2023 were almost double those in 2000, StatCan said. Beets are another potential side dish, although production of beets has declined in Canada since the record high of 46,113 tonnes in 2020, falling to 42,206 tonnes in 2023. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Parsnips are also grown here, with farmers selling $8.4 million in 2023, up from 2021, but lower than the record high set in 2014. And sweet potatoes are also grown locally, with StatCan tracking sales, area planted and marketable production since 2018. In 2023, Ontario produced 13,783 tonnes of sweet potatoes -- a figure that has been growing year over year. A.M. Headlines Newsletter Get our free morning newsletter Error!

Another Great Hot Hatch Has Just Been Killed | Carscoops,"Next month, Ford will also end production of standard Focus models. It's time to pour one out for another popular hot hatch that has been officially axed. First, it was the Renault Megane RS, and now, the final Ford Focus ST has rolled off the production line. This means the Blue Oval's entire range of hot hatches is also dead, following the earlier axing of the smaller Fiesta ST. Images of the final Focus ST built at the carmaker's Saarlouis plant in Germany were recently shared on Facebook. The red car left the factory on September 26 and doesn't appear to have received any custom touches to make it stand out from any other ST out there. There's also no word on what market it's heading to. Read: Ford Could Be Preparing To Fill A Focus-Sized Hole In Their Lineup The sporty version of the Focus has been sold across four generations since it was first introduced in 2002 as the ST170 in Europe. It was preceded by the Focus SVT that was sold exclusively in North America. The current Focus ST has been on sale since mid-2019 and rocks a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder petrol engine with 276 hp that's coupled as standard to a six-speed manual transmission. Ford implemented a minor facelift for the 2022 model year in order for its hot hatch to keep up with rivals. While the Focus ST doesn't have the power to rival the previous-gen Focus RS, nor does it rock the same trick all-wheel drive system, it has served as a solid rival to cars like the VW Golf GTI, Renault Megane RS, and Hyundai i30 N. The end of ST production isn't the only bad news for Focus enthusiasts. Production of the entire range will end in November, leaving Ford without a single traditional passenger car on sale in Europe that isn't an SUV. That means its lineup in the Old Continent will consist entirely of SUVs. Petrolheads may be disappointed, but if that's what the market wants, then the makers are practically forced to bend to its wishes.",Carscoops,2025-10-01T09:20:00Z,https://www.carscoops.com/?p=3291776,2025-10-01 17:26:52.683142,-0.0117647058823529

Sriwijaya Capital Raises $200 Million To Back Southeast Asian Growth,"Join the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ rs, 100% free. Sriwijaya Capital just scored $200 million for its debut fund, setting out to fuel Southeast Asia's next wave of growth-stage firms -- with Indonesia taking center stage. What does this mean? Sriwijaya Capital wants to reshape Southeast Asia's business scene by backing growth-stage companies, with a special focus on family-led businesses that are gearing up for new leadership and cross-border expansion. Anchored in both Singapore and Jakarta, the fund's strategy zeroes in on sectors like healthcare, energy transition, and consumer goods -- industries growing fast as the region matures. Helmed by Arsjad Rasjid, who's widely recognized for leading Indika Energy and now chairing Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce, the firm plans to take meaningful stakes in promising businesses, whether minority or majority. Its first investment could launch soon, as Sriwijaya eyes a final fund close of $300 million within the next year and Indonesia's market heats up. Investor interest in Southeast Asia is ramping up: last year, the region saw a record $28 billion in private equity and venture capital invested, according to Preqin. Sriwijaya's entry adds to this momentum, as global investors seek new growth stories beyond China and India. The fund's emphasis on transforming family businesses could trigger a wave of efficiency and scale, setting the stage for larger investor exits in the future. The bigger picture: Family firms face a fresh chapter. Family-run businesses power about 70% of Southeast Asia's private sector GDP, according to McKinsey, but many are struggling with succession and growth hurdles. By injecting outside capital and management know-how, Sriwijaya and others are lighting a fuse under regional modernization -- potentially driving development and offering a model for emerging markets worldwide.",Finimize,2025-10-01T09:24:03Z,https://finimize.com/content/sriwijaya-capital-raises-200-million-to-back-southeast-asian-growth,2025-10-01 17:26:52.684106,0.3411764705882352
Work begins on 4-story Courtyard by Marriott hotel on downtown Lexington's Main Street,"LEXINGTON -- Crews have started prep work for a four-story downtown Marriott hotel that will include a terrace overlooking Main Street. The project at 116 E. Main St. will be part of the midscale Courtyard by Marriott brand from the Maryland-based hotel giant. Builders expect it to be finished by spring 2027. ""Bringing Courtyard by Marriott here is a natural next step that honors our hospitality journey while creating a space that reflects the town's welcoming spirit and commitment to quality,"" said Raj Champaneri, chief operations officer of Lexington Hospitality, the developer of the hotel and projects including the Holiday Inn and Aloft Hotel in downtown Columbia and the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Lexington. The hotel will include 111 guest rooms as well as meeting and event spaces. A bistro will serve meals, along with Starbucks coffee and cocktails. Small workspace units developers call ""media pods"" will also be part of the hotel, giving guests a place to plug in laptops and work. Plans for the hotel have been underway for years, with town officials striking down an earlier design at a council meeting last year over its size and modern look. In an announcement after the Sept. 30 ceremony, Mashburn Construction, the project's builder, touted the hotel's brick design, saying it will align with downtown Lexington's historic buildings. Mashburn spokesperson Lindsey Yarborough told The Post and Courier that crews are clearing the land and demolishing parts of the site to level it for the project's foundation. ""This is a downtown site. So anytime we are working in a downtown environment, things can be very tight and we have to be very thoughtful about any sort of activity,"" Yarborough said. ""We also have to be thoughtful about the hours of work as to not disrupt the regular happenings of downtown and be accommodating to any external events that are going on.""",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/columbia/business/courtyard-marriott-hotel-work-begins-lexington/article_a7d17fde-10ce-4f4f-bd45-5a6e275c8442.html,2025-10-01 17:26:52.684479,0.1529411764705881
Gen H brings out part and part mortgages at 95% LTV,"The buyer brings at least a 5% deposit and takes up to 80% of their mortgage on an interest-only basis, while taking the remainder on a capital repayment basis. Gen H said buyers would own 100% of their home from day one and can overpay as normal to bring down the capital balance. Borrowers will need a household income of at least £50,000 to be eligible. Gen H said this part and part deal was aimed at renters with a small deposit who cannot currently afford a standard capital repayment mortgage for their desired property. It explained that part and part mortgages have more ""flexibility"", as buyers who cannot quite get the loan amount they need can add an interest-only portion to boost their affordability. On the flip side, buyers who want an interest-only deal but don't have a full repayment strategy can top up their deal with a capital repayment portion. Gen H said around 18% self-employed borrowers, next-time buyers and remortgagers used interest-only deals, compared to only 1% of first-time buyers. Back in 2007, Gen H said around half of first-time buyers used interest-only deals. It said the deal was partially due to a lack of financial education and a ""misconception that interest-only is just for the wealthy"", but it can be a ""powerful tool for [fine]-tuning your affordability"". Pete Dockar (pictured), Gen H's chief commercial officer, said, ""For most people, the path to homeownership isn't straightforward. In a country where the average house price is eight times the average salary - to say nothing of places like London - the best mortgage products are those that can be carefully tailored to suit the needs of individual buyers. ""Part and part mortgages do exactly that. No more renting. No need for family help. And unlike shared ownership, there's no staircasing, no frustrating administration, and no rent to be paid; just 100% homeownership from day one. We are thrilled to make this product available to our broker panel and to the growing number of clients they may now be able to support."" Rachel Geddes, strategic lender relationship director at Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB), said: ""Buying a home is one of the most significant ways to build wealth. In fact, our research shows that by continuing to rent, aspiring homeowners could be missing out on up to £340,000 in potential wealth acquisition over 30 years. However, many renters believe that owning a home is completely out of the question. ""The good news is that homeownership is often more accessible than people think. It's our job as brokers to shine a light on the many low-deposit solutions available, instilling more buyers with the confidence to buy sooner. ""We're delighted to be working with Gen H on the launch of their new part and part mortgage, which will be a game-changer in helping even more reluctant renters become homeowners."" Gen H has been widening its proposition in recent months, launching an interest-only proposition and New Build Boost. Since it was launched, the New Build Boost's approvals in principle have hit over £90m.",Mortgage Solutions,2025-10-01T09:22:05Z,https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/news/2025/10/01/gen-h-brings-out-part-and-part-mortgages-at-95-ltv/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.684869,0.1450980392156862
Gulf Markets See Mixed Moves As US Uncertainty Grows,"Join the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ rs, 100% free. Gulf stock markets took divergent paths as traders reacted to growing US uncertainty, with fears of a government shutdown delaying vital economic data and spurring fresh anxiety about interest rate changes. What does this mean? As the US government edged closer to a shutdown, Gulf investors were left in limbo, bracing for potential disruptions to key data like the non-farm payrolls report. Because Gulf currencies are pegged to the US dollar, any twist in US rates quickly ripples through local markets. This week, Saudi Arabia's main index crept up 0.1%, buoyed by a gain at Saudi Arabian Mining Company, while Abu Dhabi slipped 0.1% as ADNOC Distribution fell after going ex-dividend. Dubai's benchmark added 0.5%, with Emaar Properties and Spinneys notching standout gains after upbeat news, but Qatar's market dropped 0.8%, pulled down by Qatar National Bank. Meanwhile, oil prices held firm, as investors weighed OPEC+'s planned supply boost against concerns that US instability could dampen global energy demand. Close financial ties to the US mean Gulf markets feel every tremor from Washington -- whether it's a delayed jobs report or uncertainty around rate hikes. Oil's steady price underscores the tug of war between OPEC+ supply decisions and concerns over potential drops in global demand. Even so, local stories -- like Emaar's property moves and Spinneys' international expansion -- continue to offer bright spots, even as broader sentiment flickers. The bigger picture: Gulf economies ride the US policy rollercoaster. Because Gulf currencies move in step with the dollar, shifts in US rates or data releases ripple across the region's markets and policy decisions. Delays and surprises from Washington can cloud growth prospects and investment confidence. Combined with the ever-present uncertainty in oil prices, that means the Gulf's economic fortunes remain closely tied to what happens far beyond its borders.",Finimize,2025-10-01T09:24:03Z,https://finimize.com/content/gulf-markets-see-mixed-moves-as-us-uncertainty-grows,2025-10-01 17:26:52.685134,0.1843137254901961

Is Tulum safe for solo female travellers? - Curious Expeditions,"Is Tulum Safe for Solo Female Travellers? A Comprehensive Guide Tulum, with its breathtaking beaches, ancient Mayan ruins, and vibrant nightlife, beckons solo female travellers from across the globe. However, navigating this idyllic destination requires a nuanced understanding of its safety landscape. While Tulum can be a rewarding and enriching experience for solo female adventurers, increased cartel activity and petty theft have created a situation demanding heightened awareness and proactive safety measures. Tulum, like many popular tourist destinations in Mexico, presents a complex safety profile. While violent crime is largely concentrated away from tourist zones, its proximity and occasional spillover effects necessitate caution. Reports of petty theft, scams, and even incidents involving tainted alcohol at bars have increased in recent years. This doesn't necessarily preclude a safe trip, but it underscores the importance of being informed and prepared. The vibrant nightlife, a major draw for tourists, also presents potential risks. Partying responsibly, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, and being mindful of your surroundings are crucial. Trust your intuition; if a situation feels unsafe, remove yourself from it immediately. Safety in Tulum, as in any travel destination, is largely a matter of proactive planning and smart decision-making. Before you even pack your bags, research reliable accommodation options, preferably those with good security measures. Consider staying in well-lit areas and avoiding isolated neighbourhoods, especially at night. During your stay, employ common-sense safety practices. Avoid displaying expensive jewellery or gadgets. Be aware of your belongings at all times, especially in crowded areas. Utilise reputable transportation services like pre-booked taxis or ride-sharing apps, and always confirm the driver's identity before entering the vehicle. Finally, communication is key. Let friends or family know your itinerary and check in regularly. Share your location with trusted contacts and have emergency contact numbers readily accessible. The most common safety concerns include petty theft, scams targeting tourists, potential exposure to tainted alcohol, and encounters with pushy vendors. While less frequent, incidents related to organized crime are a concern, especially if venturing outside well-trodden tourist paths. Generally, it's advisable to avoid the outskirts of town and poorly lit, isolated areas, especially at night. Exercise increased caution in less developed neighbourhoods further inland. Stick to the main tourist zones, particularly along the hotel zone and the main street, Avenida Tulum, after dark. Be wary of overly friendly strangers offering unsolicited assistance or tours. Negotiate prices before agreeing to any services, whether it's a taxi ride, a massage, or a handicraft purchase. Research average prices beforehand to avoid being overcharged. Always pay attention when using ATMs and be discreet when handling money. While most establishments are reputable, there have been reports of tainted alcohol in some bars and clubs in Mexico. Stick to well-known and established venues and order drinks yourself directly from the bartender. Observe how your drink is prepared. Stick to bottled beer or drinks you can watch being made. Limit your alcohol consumption to stay alert and aware of your surroundings. Avoid walking alone at night, especially on dimly lit streets. Utilize reputable transportation options such as pre-booked taxis from your hotel or authorized taxi stands. Ride-sharing apps like Uber are available but may have limited coverage in certain areas. Consider renting a scooter during the day, but exercise extreme caution and always wear a helmet. Driving at night is not generally recommended due to poor lighting and road conditions. Trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a situation, remove yourself immediately. Seek refuge in a well-lit, public area like a restaurant or hotel. Report any incidents to the local police (Dirección de Seguridad Pública Municipal) or your embassy or consulate. When visiting cenotes, swim with a buddy and be aware of your surroundings. Follow the instructions of the lifeguards or park rangers. At Mayan ruins, stay on designated paths and be respectful of the historical site. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen, and be mindful of the weather conditions. Keep the following emergency contact information readily accessible: While not strictly necessary, knowing basic Spanish phrases can be incredibly helpful for communicating with locals and navigating unfamiliar situations. Consider learning common phrases for directions, ordering food, and asking for help. Utilize reputable booking websites like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Expedia. Read reviews carefully, paying attention to comments about safety and security. Look for accommodations with security features like 24-hour front desk service, security cameras, and well-lit surroundings. Consider staying in established hotels or resorts rather than isolated rentals. Dress modestly and avoid displaying expensive jewellery or gadgets. Be respectful of local customs and traditions. Avoid speaking loudly or behaving disruptively. Try to blend in with the crowd and avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself as a tourist. Yes, absolutely. Travel insurance is essential for covering unexpected medical expenses, lost or stolen belongings, and trip cancellations. Make sure your policy includes coverage for Mexico and any activities you plan to participate in, such as scuba diving or exploring Mayan ruins. Carefully review the policy details and understand the coverage limits and exclusions. Ultimately, Tulum offers a unique and potentially transformative experience for solo female travellers who approach their journey with awareness and preparation. By understanding the risks, implementing proactive safety measures, and staying informed, you can significantly increase your chances of a safe and unforgettable adventure in this captivating corner of Mexico. Remember to prioritize your safety, trust your intuition, and enjoy the beauty and magic that Tulum has to offer.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T09:15:16Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/is-tulum-safe-for-solo-female-travellers/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.685996,0.2862745098039217
Latest News InCred Capital cements IB standing with Beroe fundraise - Businessfortnight,"Advisory-led, capital-enabled investment banking, serving marquee legacy and new age companies MUMBAI, India, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- India's deal-making landscape is undergoing a shift -- with legacy businesses reinventing themselves and new-age firms raising growth capital at scale. At the centre of this momentum is InCred Capital's Investment Banking (IB) platform, which has emerged as one of India's highest-conversion franchises with over 200 completed transactions and more than US$8.5Bn closed across ECM, M&A, and private capital. The edge is how mandates are run: one accountable team from start to finish, tight timelines, and the full weight of the firm behind every mandate -- decision-makers in the room from first pitch to final signatures. The stance is advisory-first always, but when capital improves certainty or timing, the firm stands ready to commit its own balance sheet to anchor, bridge, or backstop. InCred Capital has advised on marquee transactions, such as the ₹3,690 Cr rights issue for Indiabulls Housing Finance, the ₹2,825 Cr sale of Raymond's consumer business to Godrej Consumer Products, and the ₹1,270 Cr preferential issue for UGRO. In the new-age ecosystem, it advised on the ₹1,000 Cr pre-IPO secondary stake sale of Swiggy, the ₹613 Cr capital raise for OYO, and the ₹490 Cr pre-IPO for Ethos Watches. The team also drove strategic moves like the ₹682 Cr M&A advisory for Raymond Group, the ₹470 Cr acquisition of OSAM Dairy by Dodla Dairy, and the ₹230 Cr capital raise for Livpure. Most recently, InCred Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Beroe, the global leader in procurement decision intelligence, on its ₹300 Cr (US$34 million) primary fundraise, cementing its role as a trusted partner to both high-growth scale-ups and global leaders in capital formation.

That 40-cent wage hike isn't the biggest threat to Toronto's smallest businesses. Here's what is,"Unfortunately you've used all of your gifts this month. Your counter will reset on the first day of next month. Commercial rents that have risen about 140 per cent over five years are putting Toronto's smallest businesses at risk, according to a new report from Better Way Alliance. The group says the skyrocketing leases are affecting businesses' bottom lines far more than wage increases. ""Labour is a cost, but for a small business in Toronto, it may not actually be the biggest cost,"" said Aaron Binder, communications director for the Better Way Alliance, a network of Canadian business owners and non-profit executives that promotes investing in employees. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""There's a return on investment when the minimum wage goes up or when you decide to pay a worker more than minimum wage. There's generally a productive element there, whereas with a rent increase and insurance increase, that can be net negative."" On Oct. 1, Ontario's minimum wage increases to $17.60 an hour, up 40 cents. To arrive at their figures, Better Way Alliance analyzed cost increases for a typical Toronto neighbourhood ""micro business"" -- a 1,000-square-foot retail space with three employees such as a dry cleaner, convenience store or strip mall restaurant -- including commercial rent numbers from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. That data shows commercial retail lease rates went from $19.54 per square foot in the first quarter of 2019 to $47.21 in the third quarter of 2024 -- a 142 per cent increase. Business insurance was up $650 annually, and electricity costs $200 to 800, while minimum wage labour rose 23 per cent, the report found. Toronto the Better Toronto's neighbourhoods are losing local storefronts fast. Here's what can be done to save them 'Buy local' is having an effect, but experts say more can be done to keep the shops that make Anita Agrawal, CEO and designer of Jewels 4 Ever, a small jewelry manufacturing company that sells to other small businesses and Walmart, had to downsize last year due to increasing rent costs, closing a second location. She now has under 1,000 square feet on Queen Street East. ""It just became insurmountable"" said Agrawal. Meanwhile staff costs have been manageable and expected. ""The minimum wage increase is nowhere near where it needs to be. It actually needs to be much higher,"" she said. ""Our jewelry is known to be affordable. That's why Walmart is one of the places that we sell to. There's no way anybody can afford it if they're not making enough money."" ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Fellow jewelry manufacturer Laura Sultan, who owns Designs by Nature Gems, said paying employees a living wage means they are more likely to return, even if they are laid off when times get tough.

""You don't necessarily move to the neighbourhood for McDonald's or a Starbucks, but you will move to a neighbourhood that has great local restaurants, and great local cafes, where people know your name, your order,"" he said.

They range from encouraging developers to build smaller spaces with more affordable rents, to creating ""more rights for small renters, who are often negotiating against multibillion-dollar companies when their leases come up,"" he added.

UK Business Confidence Falls to Record Low as Costs Surge,"Labour and energy costs top list of concerns for company bosses Business sentiment in the UK hit a record low in September as companies expressed sharp concern over rising labour costs and energy bills. According to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD), cost expectations soared to new highs, and confidence among bosses has 'plumbed new depths' following a brief summer rebound. In a press statement, Anna Leach, chief economist at the IoD, described the September results as a stark reversal: 'Business confidence has plumbed new depths in September, following a fleeting improvement at the tag-end of summer.' She added that 'conditions worsened across the board, with cost expectations hitting a record high, driven notably by employment costs.' In the IoD survey, employment or wage pressures emerged as the top concern for business leaders, followed by energy and overheads. Many firms are now facing a squeeze: rising costs on multiple fronts at a time when revenue growth is fragile. With those challenges mounting, Leach called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver a November budget that places growth at its heart and supports industry through this difficult period. The gloomy business outlook is compounded by warnings from senior officials at the Bank of England, who cautioned that recent inflationary surprises could linger longer than expected. Clare Lombardelli, a deputy governor, warned against assuming that inflation shocks are transitory. Meanwhile, Catherine Mann, a Monetary Policy Committee member, said she believes the UK is experiencing a persistent inflation scenario. 'I believe that [an] inflation persistence scenario is playing out,' she commented. 'The chancellor's conference speech rightly reiterated the role that fiscal credibility has in providing the platform for growth.' Mann's remarks signal that further rate cuts may not be as straightforward as some economists had hoped, especially if wage and food price pressures remain sticky. The macroeconomic backdrop is likewise fragile. Official figures show second-quarter economic growth slowing to 0.3% -- down from 0.7% in the first quarter -- raising questions about momentum going into late 2025. Meanwhile, the OECD recently forecast that UK inflation will average around 3.5% in 2025 -- among the highest in the G7 -- even as growth is expected to decelerate in 2026. The OECD pointed to regulated costs, energy pressures, and the rise in employer National Insurance contributions as key drivers pushing inflation above target. In this environment, the IoD's record-low confidence may be both a symptom and a warning sign: indicating that businesses see little room for manoeuvre in a tighter, higher-cost economy. While the IoD survey aggregates sentiment, individual voices across sectors reflect deep unease. Small and medium enterprises, in particular, say that staffing costs, national insurance hikes, and wage pressures are reversing gains made earlier in the year. Retailers and service firms have reported trimming hiring plans or delaying investment decisions due to cost uncertainty. Some firms also expressed frustration at weakening demand and competitive pressures from overseas markets, pointing to supply chain inflation and energy volatility as amplifiers of stress. The timing of the crisis is critical. With annual budget announcements due in November, many business leaders see that as a pivotal moment. The IoD has urged Reeves to prioritise growth, ease burdens on employers, and restore confidence. Analysts suggest the government may be forced to consider tax relief, targeted business support, or spending realignment to ease the pressure on firms. But with limited fiscal space and inflation already elevated, the challenge for policymakers is considerable. Persistently high inflation, weak demand, and rising costs present a delicate balancing act for both fiscal and monetary authorities. If wages, energy bills, and taxation continue to push upward, business pessimism may deepen further, reinforcing a vicious cycle of lower investment, weaker growth, and mounting debt pressures. For now, the echoes of the IoD's negative survey reverberate across Whitehall corridors and boardrooms alike.",International Business Times UK,2025-10-01T09:23:51Z,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/uk-business-confidence-plunges-record-low-labour-energy-costs-bite-1745987,2025-10-01 17:26:52.687181,0.1372549019607843
Prediction Markets Close Gap With Solana Memecoins as Trading Volume Shifts Toward 'Truth Capital',"Solana memecoins registered $2.8 billion in trading volume, the smallest since early September 2024. Prediction markets registered $1.54 billion in trading volume between Sept. 22 and 28, narrowing the gap with Solana memecoins. The four leading prediction market platforms captured 55% of the weekly trading activity compared to memecoins on Solana, according to data shared by X user MovieTime on Sept. 29. Solana memecoins registered $2.8 billion in trading volume for the same period, the smallest volume since early September 2024, according to Blockworks data. Amid the Solana memecoins hype, Kalshi dominated weekly volumes with $854.7 million, its all-time high in weekly volume, according to data from DefiLlama. The figure surpassed the previous peak of $750 million seen during the US election week of Nov. 4 and 10. Data from DefiLlama showed that Polymarket registered $355.6 million in weekly volume, the second-best week since the last week of December 2024, bested only by the previous week of Sept. 15 and 21. Together, Polymarket and Kalshi accounted for 78.6% of the prediction market's weekly trading volume. MovieTime assessed the movement: ""Truth capital markets. More capital in these markets makes it more accurate. When we get more volume, then we get bigger players. Which causes more volume. positive feedback loop. I think prediction markets are here to stay."" Starting the week of Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, prediction markets generated more volume Solana memecoins on Sept. 29, according to data shared by Kalshi's growth team member, ultra. While prediction markets registered $351.7 million in daily volume, memecoins reached $277.2 million the same day. The daily flip marked a potential inflection point in crypto trading patterns. However, it was too early to predict that prediction markets could soon become the new destination for crypto traders, rather than memecoins, based on a single weak week for memecoin trading. The momentum of prediction markets suggested that they could compete with memecoin trading for volume. Kalshi and Polymarket starred in a South Park episode on Sept. 24, dedicated to the theme of prediction markets. The cultural recognition reflected growing mainstream awareness of the platforms. Prediction markets are also seen as more fundamentally grounded than memecoins, as the platforms assist with results based on verifiable outcomes rather than pure speculation. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, wrote a blog post in November 2024, while prediction markets were booming, fueled by the US elections, describing their importance. He stated: ""To many people, prediction markets are about betting on elections, and betting on elections is gambling - nice if it helps people enjoy themselves, but fundamentally not more interesting than buying random coins on pump.fun."" Buterin explained his interest in the concept: ""I believe that prediction markets even as they exist today are a very useful tool for the world, but furthermore prediction markets are only one example of a much larger incredibly powerful category, with potential to create better implementations of social media, science, news, governance, and other fields. I shall label this category' info finance'."" According to him, info finance is the possibility of using finance as a way to align incentives in order to provide viewers with valuable information. The concept begins with the fact that someone wants to know something, and the query is directed to the market to elicit that information from market participants in an optimal manner. Buterin believes that using prediction markets presents ""a credibly neutral, fast, and cheap"" alternative to the traditional information mechanism. This belief, shared by one of the key figures in crypto and echoed by other important players, could provide fundamental support for prediction markets to attract more market participation in the crypto market.",The Coin Republic,2025-10-01T05:40:00Z,https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2025/10/01/prediction-markets-close-gap-with-solana-memecoins-as-trading-volume-shifts-toward-truth-capital/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.687605,0.06666666666666665
JICA Signs USD 75 mn loan with ECOM to support Asian coffee farmers,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (PTI) The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has signed a loan agreement for up to USD 75 million with ECOM Agroindustrial Corp Ltd and its group company ECOM Agroindustrial Asia Pte Ltd to support coffee supply chains across Asia, JICA said on Wednesday. The loan, co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), marks JICA's first exclusive working capital loan and aims to strengthen cooperation with global agricultural trading companies to support Asia's agricultural and food supply chains. The financing will support stable procurement of coffee from over 60,000 smallholder farmers in India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam, JICA said in a statement. The project includes purchase funds and consulting services such as coffee certification support, climate change adaptation pilot projects and farming support for female farmers. India's coffee industry accounted for 3 per cent of global production in 2022, ranking eighth worldwide, and provides direct employment to over two million people. About 98 per cent of coffee farmers in India are small-scale producers relying on limited land for cultivation and unstable coffee income. The loan aligns with India's ""Doubling Farmers' Income"" mission and complements the G7's commitment to support the global coffee value chain, as outlined in the Apulia G7 Leaders' Communiqué in June 2024. ""We are honoured to launch JICA's first exclusive working capital loan with the ECOM Group,"" Takehiro Yasui, director general of JICA's Private Sector Partnership and Finance Department, said. ""We hope to expand our financing scheme to support supply chain business like this one from now on."" The project is part of JICA's ""Facility for Supporting Agricultural Supply Chain and Food Security Enhancement (SAFE)"" programme, announced at the G7 Hiroshima Summit in 2023, which has USD 1 billion in funding to address global food security challenges.

"Federal Reserve Board modifies Morgan Stanley's stress capital buffer requirement, after the firm requested reconsideration","As a result, the bank's requirement for this year is 4.3 percent, down from a preliminary 5.1 percent. The Board's stress test process allows banks to request reconsideration of their stress capital buffer requirement, which is the capital requirement stemming from the stress test. A bank is required to submit a detailed explanation of why reconsideration should be granted, and the Board then conducts an independent assessment of the request. Based on an analysis of information presented by , the Board determined that estimated losses in the bank's fair value option loan portfolio were too conservative. This was due, in part, to the unique composition of the bank's loan portfolio. In addition, the Board determined to use the bank's second largest counterparty when measuring counterparty losses associated with default of the largest counterparty, as doing so would be more consistent with the Board's treatment of similar counterparties. The Board will also consider any potential stress test model refinements related to this request in its upcoming proposal to improve the transparency of the stress test.

Women lawyers call for greater female representation in lead,"KAMPALA - Women lawyers under their umbrella, Female Lawyers' Network (FLN) have urged the Government, political parties, civil society and the electoral bodies to promote the full participation of women at all levels of leadership and in the electoral process, as voters, candidates, observers and decision-makers. They also want institutions and partners to invest in training, mentoring, and legal empowerment of women in electoral governance. Emphasis should be put on addressing gender biases, harassment, threats and political violence, all while promoting digital safety. The call was made during the FLN-organised Women in Electoral Governance symposium held at Hotel Africana on September 26, 2025, under the theme: The Role of Women in strengthening the Electoral process in Uganda; Threats, Opportunities and Good Practices. FLN was established in 2021 to empower women in law and eradicate gender injustices across age groups and sectors in the legal profession. Meanwhile, the symposium was attended by over 300 women, including representatives from the Uganda Electoral Commission (EC), National Water and Sewerage corporation, Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), the Judiciary, Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA), National Planning Authority (NPA), Universities, government and UN agencies. Others were from law firms, non-governmental organisations, Civil Society Organisations, academia, media, private sector and security organisations.

How much does the Disney CEO get paid? - Curious Expeditions,"FAQ 12: What are the long-term trends expected in CEO compensation at Disney? The Disney CEO's compensation package is a multifaceted arrangement that can fluctuate significantly based on the company's performance. While the precise figure varies year to year, recent filings reveal Bob Iger's total compensation for fiscal year 2023 was approximately $31.6 million, encompassing salary, stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, and changes in pension value and deferred compensation earnings. The compensation of a CEO at a company as vast and influential as Disney is a subject of intense scrutiny and public interest. It reflects not only the value placed on leadership skills and strategic vision but also the complex interplay between corporate governance, shareholder expectations, and market dynamics. It's crucial to understand the various components that contribute to the total figure to gain a comprehensive perspective. A Disney CEO's compensation isn't simply a large salary check. It's a carefully structured package designed to incentivize performance, align executive interests with shareholder value, and attract and retain top talent. The major elements typically include: It's essential to note that the total compensation for the Disney CEO has varied quite a bit in recent years, influenced by both company performance and leadership transitions. Bob Iger's initial run as CEO saw significant increases in compensation as the company expanded and thrived. Following his retirement and subsequent return, his pay structure has been carefully calibrated. In contrast, Bob Chapek's tenure saw different compensation structures and outcomes. Understanding these historical trends provides context for the current figures. The 2023 compensation, in comparison to previous years, is heavily influenced by Iger's re-appointment and the challenges the company faces in the streaming market and navigating the evolving entertainment landscape. The Wall Street Journal and other reputable financial news sources provide detailed breakdowns of executive compensation packages as they are publicly disclosed. Here are some of the most common questions people have about Disney CEO compensation: The Disney CEO manages a massive global entertainment conglomerate with vast operations spanning theme parks, media networks, streaming services, and movie studios. The scale of responsibility and the impact of the CEO's decisions on the company's financial performance, brand reputation, and shareholder value justify a high level of compensation. The CEO's decisions directly affect billions in revenue and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of employees. A competitive compensation package is necessary to attract and retain individuals with the experience, vision, and leadership qualities required to manage such a complex organization. The Compensation Committee of Disney's Board of Directors is responsible for determining the CEO's compensation. This committee is composed of independent board members who are tasked with ensuring that the CEO's pay is aligned with the company's performance, industry benchmarks, and shareholder interests. The committee typically consults with independent compensation consultants to benchmark against peer companies and develop a pay package that is both competitive and fair. The specific performance metrics used to determine the CEO's bonus vary from year to year, but they generally include measures of financial performance, such as revenue growth, operating income, earnings per share, and free cash flow. They also often include metrics related to strategic goals, such as r growth for Disney+, successful film releases, and the development of new business initiatives. These metrics directly incentivize the CEO to deliver strong financial results and execute the company's strategic vision. Disney's CEO compensation is generally in line with, and sometimes slightly above, that of CEOs at other major entertainment companies, such as Netflix, Comcast (NBCUniversal), and Warner Bros. Discovery. Comparisons are based on factors like company size, revenue, market capitalization, and performance. The benchmarking process is critical in ensuring that Disney's compensation package remains competitive and attracts top talent. However, the volatility of the streaming market and other industry-specific factors can significantly influence these comparisons year to year. Stock options and stock awards can significantly impact the CEO's net worth, particularly if the company's stock price performs well. As the stock price increases, the value of the CEO's stock holdings and unexercised stock options also increases. This alignment of financial interests incentivizes the CEO to make decisions that benefit shareholders and drive long-term value creation. Stock-based compensation is a key component of executive pay for many reasons, not the least of which is tax implications that favor both the employee and the company. The ratio of CEO compensation to the median employee salary at Disney is substantial, as it is at most large corporations. This disparity has been a source of public debate and scrutiny, particularly in light of concerns about income inequality. While the CEO's responsibilities and impact justify a higher level of compensation, the pay ratio is a metric that is increasingly monitored by investors and stakeholders. If Disney performs poorly, the CEO's compensation can be significantly reduced, particularly the portion tied to performance-based bonuses and stock options. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to reduce or eliminate bonuses if the company fails to meet its financial targets or strategic goals. A declining stock price would also negatively impact the value of the CEO's stock options and stock awards. The Compensation Committee evaluates the CEO's performance based on a variety of factors, including financial results, strategic execution, leadership skills, and the overall performance of the company. The committee may also consider feedback from other board members, executives, and external stakeholders. The performance evaluation process is rigorous and comprehensive, ensuring that the CEO is held accountable for their actions and decisions. While the CEO may provide input and feedback to the Compensation Committee, the final decision on compensation rests with the independent members of the committee. The committee is responsible for ensuring that the CEO's pay is aligned with the company's performance and shareholder interests. The CEO's role is primarily to present their vision and performance to the committee for evaluation. Disney is required to disclose detailed information about its CEO's compensation in its annual proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are publicly available and provide a comprehensive overview of the CEO's salary, bonuses, stock awards, option awards, and other benefits. This transparency allows investors and stakeholders to scrutinize the company's executive compensation practices. Some common criticisms of Disney's CEO compensation practices include concerns about the size of the pay package relative to the median employee salary, the potential for misalignment of interests between executives and shareholders, and the complexity of the compensation structure. Some critics argue that the emphasis on short-term financial performance can incentivize executives to make decisions that are detrimental to the company's long-term prospects. Shareholder activism frequently focuses on executive compensation as a means of holding boards accountable. The long-term trends in CEO compensation at Disney are likely to be influenced by several factors, including the performance of the company, changes in corporate governance practices, and evolving investor expectations. There is likely to be increased scrutiny of performance metrics and a greater emphasis on linking executive pay to long-term value creation. The ongoing debate about pay equity and the increasing influence of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are also likely to shape future compensation decisions. Understanding the intricacies of Disney CEO compensation requires a nuanced perspective. By examining the various components of the pay package and considering the broader context of corporate governance and market dynamics, we can gain a more informed understanding of this complex topic.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T09:16:24Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/how-much-does-the-disney-ceo-get-paid/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.690194,0.3725490196078431

I understand I can opt out at any time through an email that I receive, or by clicking here Last year on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump repeatedly promised to ""slash energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months."" But actions speak louder than words. Since returning to office in January, the Trump administration has instead done everything it possibly can to drive up the cost of electricity. What is going on? The damage starts with Trump's attempts to prevent any new clean energy generation at a time when electricity demand is growing rapidly, caused by an explosion of new data centers and new housing, the expanding fleet of electric vehicles and a resurgence in American manufacturing. The U.S. needs more energy than ever, and 96% of electricity capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2024 came from clean energy. Why? Because clean energy is both the cheapest source of electricity and the fastest to produce. If we don't rethink our energy future quickly enough to keep up with a growth in demand, then electricity prices will only continue to rise. Then again, maybe the recent price spikes are part of Trump's goals, because he's done everything he can do to block new clean energy, including: -- Raising taxes on clean energy projects by at least 30% when Trump had all the renewable energy tax credits removed from his ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" -- Blocking clean energy projects on federal lands, effectively creating a bureaucratic veto by requiring Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to personally sign off on permitting for every proposed clean energy project. -- Issuing ""stop work"" orders (with no significant justification) for two offshore wind projects that were fully approved and permitted -- and, in one case, where construction was already 80% complete. This not only drives up the cost of constructing new electricity resources; it also creates a business climate in which no sane company would risk investing in new projects that may be torpedoed by an arbitrary and capricious federal government simply because the President thinks wind turbines mar his view. -- Canceling a Department of Energy loan commitment for the Grain Belt Express, a major transmission project designed to carry low-cost wind and solar energy from the Great Plains to Illinois and other eastern U.S. states where electricity prices have risen rapidly. This deprives those states of new energy and undermines the ability of Great Plains states to harness natural resources and grow their economies as energy exporters. -- Gutting federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office, which helps finance big energy projects, especially for innovative new technologies such as geothermal and new nuclear. Without government support for first-of-their-kind projects, these initiatives simply won't happen and promising new energy technology will be delayed for years. It's not just the cost of building clean energy development that Trump has sabotaged. His high and ever-changing tariffs have also scrambled supply chains and raised prices for all types of energy. New tariffs, for example, have raised the cost of steel by up to 50%, which affects the cost of pipes needed for natural gas plants as well as towers for wind turbines and racks for solar panels. Every single kind of new electricity generation is now more expensive, and those higher material costs create higher prices for electricity on our utility bills. Trump has also raised costs of existing energy resources, including supporting the oil industry's efforts to dramatically increase U.S. exports of natural gas. This will reduce the supply available for heating homes and running power plants in America, raising prices on electricity bills and gas bills at once. Trump has also used emergency powers to force less-than-profitable coal plants to stay open, saddling customers with the extra costs to subsidize these old plants. In one instance, it cost locals $29 million to keep the J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Mich., open for just five weeks of extended operations. Analysts now estimate that Trump's push to keep coal plants open could add between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to our electricity bills. Is this sheer economic incompetence -- not difficult to fathom given the rate at which Trump has driven businesses into bankruptcy -- or part of his strategy to deliberately make electricity more expensive so people won't switch to EVs and the oil industry won't lose its customers? Either way, electricity prices are already rising and Trump's actions are clearly making it worse. Doubtless, Republicans will try to point the finger at renewable energy when electricity prices spike over coming years, but the real causes should be clear: Trump's reckless decisions to block new clean energy production, raise tariffs on the energy supply chain, export our natural gas and force customers to subsidize struggling coal plants. Americans need abundant, affordable energy to power our homes and grow our economy, and we need leaders who know how to support the clean energy revolution, not try to stand in its way. ____ Josh Becker is a Democratic state senator from Menlo Park and chair of the California Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications. _____",ArcaMax,2025-10-01T09:22:55Z,https://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-3869882,2025-10-01 17:26:52.690841,0.2470588235294118

How one Sask. First Nation is using tourism as an education tool,"One Saskatchewan First Nation is marketing itself as an Indigenous tourism destination in hopes of educating visitors on Canada's dark past. In the heart of Treaty Six Territory, tourists can explore the land, history and culture of Saskatchewan's Willow Cree people, while playing their role in reconciliation, according to Kevin Seesequasis, director for community and tourism development with the Beardy's and Okemasis Cree Nation. ""We've always seen this place, this space, this territory as a gathering place,"" Seesequasis said. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action include recommendations to foster Indigenous tourism as a means of cultural education and economic development. For decades, Beardy's and Okemasis Cree Nation has seen the potential in becoming a tourism destination. ""As far back as 1988, our community leaders have talked about tourism as a catalyst for cultural regeneration, language revitalization and sharing stories,"" Seesequasis said. The First Nation created Pêmiska Tourism in 2018. Pêmiska means ""come and find it"" in Cree, according to tourism marketing officer Collin Alexander. ""It's really an invitation for guests to come into Beardy's and experience Indigenous culture, and come find us, and find a little bit about themselves, too,"" Alexander said. Beardy's and Okemasis Cree Nation sits on Treaty Six Territory in central Saskatchewan, about 45 minutes north of Saskatoon. The area is rich in historical significance. Treaty Six was signed in the area nearly 150 years ago at Fort Carlton, which is now a national historic site. The first battle of the North-West Resistance - the Battle of Duck Lake - took place on Beardy's and Okemasis land, and it's the site of the former St. Michael's Indian Residential School that burned down in 2021. ""It's very, very important for us to be able to share those stories with Canadians who want to learn more about reconciliation, and want to learn how to interact with reconciliation,"" Seesequasis said. Indigenous tourism has accelerated in the last decade, according to the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC). There are about 2,700 businesses across Canada that are owned and operated by Indigenous entrepreneurs or communities. ""We've been saying for years that Indigenous tourism is reconciliation in action,"" ITAC president and CEO Keith Henry said. ""It helps bring economic stability for our artists, our culture and our languages in ways that it's not all relying on government investments."" Pêmiska Tourism is coming off its busiest summer to date and plans to stay open for the winter, marking the first time it will operate year-round.

There can be no better investment opportunity I could think of then this one. Good luck to whoever can get their hands on to it. It definitely will set a new record valuation which will just go to show that IPL is the not only the fastest growing Global Sporting league but also the most valuable.

"No plans to impose charges on UPI transactions, clarifies RBI Governor Malhotra - CNBC TV18","RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra confirmed UPI transactions will remain free, dismissing speculation about charges. Repo rate held at 5.5%, GDP growth forecast raised to 6.8%.Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday reiterated that the central bank is not considering any charges on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. Speaking at the post-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) press conference, Malhotra emphasized that while UPI is currently subsidised by the government to remain a zero-cost platform, ""no proposal to impose charges is under consideration at present."" His comments come amid speculation about the sustainability of UPI's free-to-use model, which has powered record growth in digital transactions. Malhotra clarified that although operational costs exist, the system will continue without charges under the current framework. The Governor also addressed broader monetary policy and banking sector issues. The central bank kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.5% and retained its neutral stance, while revising FY26 GDP growth forecast to 6.8%. Malhotra noted that two MPC members had favoured shifting the stance to accommodative, though he described it as ""forward guidance"" rather than a liquidity signal. On the banking sector, Malhotra said the RBI would continue consultations with stakeholders, aiming for ""balanced, calibrated measures"" to promote stability and growth. He also underlined efforts to reduce reliance on cross-currencies, highlighting work with the Indonesian Rupiah and UAE Dirham. UPI-linked stocks saw an immediate impact.

GBP/USD Faces Headwinds as UK Deficit and US Shutdown Pressure the Pound | Investing.com,"The GBP/USD pair is trading near 1.3445 on Wednesday, with the pound closing September with its first monthly decline against the US dollar since July. Short-term price action remains under pressure from the looming US government shutdown, which threatens to delay the release of key US macroeconomic data, injecting uncertainty into the market. Domestic economic figures from the UK offered a mixed picture. Second-quarter GDP growth was confirmed at 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, matching forecasts. However, the current account deficit widened significantly to £28.9 billion, or 3.8% of GDP, up from 2.8% in the previous quarter and well beyond expectations. The pound is also contending with substantial domestic headwinds. The UK continues to grapple with the highest inflation rate among major developed economies (around 4%) and elevated borrowing costs. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden emphasised that inflation remains excessively high, noting two-sided risks. She warned that prices for food and services could keep inflation stubbornly elevated, despite emerging signs of a slowdown in wage growth. Further pressure stems from fiscal policy, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves preparing the budget for 26th November. Tax rises are seen as almost inevitable to cover a fiscal gap estimated in the tens of billions of pounds. In summary, the pound is caught between external risks -- such as the US shutdown and global capital flows -- and domestic challenges, including a high deficit, persistent inflation, and the prospect of fiscal tightening. On the H4 chart, GBP/USD formed a tight consolidation range around 1.3434. Following an upward breakout, the pair is now developing a corrective wave towards 1.3550. Once this correction is complete, we anticipate the start of a new decline towards 1.3434, with a longer-term prospect of extending the downtrend to 1.3330. This outlook is technically confirmed by the MACD indicator, whose signal line is below zero but is rising steadily. H1 Chart: The H1 chart shows the pair forming a consolidation range around 1.3418 before breaking upwards. It is now continuing a growth wave towards a local target of 1.3490. Following this, a decline back to 1.3418 (testing it as support from above) is expected. Subsequently, another upward structure could develop, targeting at least 1.3508, with a potential extension to 1.3550. The Stochastic oscillator supports this view, with its signal line above 50 and rising sharply towards 80. The pound is navigating a complex landscape of domestic economic weaknesses and external uncertainties. While a short-term technical correction is underway, the broader fundamental and technical picture suggests the downward trajectory is likely to resume after the current upward move is exhausted.

"Stocks mixed, gold hits record as US government shuts down","LONDON :Wall Street futures fell, gold struck a record high and the dollar eased on Wednesday as the U.S. government shut down much of its operations, possibly delaying the release of crucial jobs data that could muddy the interest rate outlook. With no clear path out of the impasse over a funding deal, agencies warned the government shutdown would halt the release of a closely watched September employment report and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400 million. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures dropped about 0.6 per cent each on Wednesday. Gold prices climbed to $3,895 an ounce, hitting a record high for a third straight session. European shares were mostly higher, with the pan-continental STOXX 600 up 0.4 per cent. Britain's FTSE 100 and Switzerland's SMI outperformed, boosted by healthcare stocks which jumped on expectations they could avoid excessive U.S. import tariffs after President Donald Trump struck a deal with Pfizer on prescription drug prices. With Friday's nonfarm payrolls report expected to be absent, investors may place greater weight on the ADP National Employment Report due later today. Forecasts are centred on a modest gain of 50,000 private-sector jobs. ""The shutdown ought not to have any major effect on markets,"" said Lars Skovgaard, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank. ""I wouldn't rule out that it can add some jitters but you shouldn't be worried about it. We're not,"" Skovgaard added. Futures now imply a 95 per cent chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in October, up from 90 per cent from a day earlier, with around a 75 per cent probability of another move in December. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said in a note that if the shutdown lingers, September inflation reports in mid-October could also be negatively affected. ""An extended period where the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is not operating at full strength could affect data collection efforts for other reports, which may impact the quality of the data,"" he said. On Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.9 per cent, after an 11 per cent surge the previous quarter. South Korean shares rose 0.9 per cent, adding to the 11.5 per cent gain in the last quarter, after data showed its exports rose at the fastest pace in 14 months in September. Taiwan's shares gained 0.6 per cent. The island's top tariff negotiator said on Wednesday that Taiwan will not agree to a deal with Washington for half of all semiconductor production to take place in the U.S. Chinese markets, including Hong Kong, were closed for a public holiday. DOLLAR FALLS In foreign exchange markets, the dollar index slipped for a fourth straight day and was last down 0.2 per cent to 97.59. The euro rose 0.2 per cent to $1.1756, while sterling was up 0.2 per cent at $1.3474. The dollar was off 0.6 per cent at 147.06 yen, after a Bank of Japan survey showed confidence among big Japanese manufacturers improved for a second quarter, heightening the chance of an interest rate hike as soon as this month. In the Treasuries market, yields were steady in European morning trade. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was flat at 4.156 per cent, having risen 1 basis point the day before. Oil prices were steady after two consecutive days of losses as investors weighed potential OPEC+ plans for a larger output hike next month against the prospect of shrinking inventories in the U.S. U.S. crude was down about 0.1 per cent at $62.28 a barrel, while Brent was 0.1 per cent lower at $65.94.",CNA,2025-10-01T02:08:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/stocks-mixed-gold-hits-record-us-government-shuts-down-5378991,2025-10-01 17:26:52.693835,0.1843137254901961

Will Budget 2026 do anything about prices you pay for groceries?,"Analysis: The use of any budget measures to relieve the cost of living crisis is limited by fiscal constraints and economic uncertainty With Budget 2026 approaching, expectations are high that the Government will act decisively on the cost of living crisis, but fiscal constraints and economic uncertainty limit its room for manoeuvre. Advisory bodies have already warned against repeating the mistakes of the Celtic Tiger era, when booming corporate tax receipts and the construction sector were allowed to overinflate public finances. Added to this are international risks, not least the threat of tariffs by Donald Trump, which cast a shadow over Ireland's export-led economy. These pressures suggest that this will be a conservative budget, rather than a pre-election giveaway. The Government is expected to have just €1.5 billion available for tax cuts, meaning choices will be tight.

Groceries Beginning with the elephant in the room, the price of groceries has become one of the sharpest pain points for households, but it is also the area where the Government has the fewest tools. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission recently found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour among Ireland's supermarkets. That rules out price-fixing as a cause of rising costs and leaves the Government without a clear lever to pull. Unlike energy or childcare, there are no subsidy schemes or tax adjustments that can bring down food prices directly. Global supply chains, input costs, and retailer margins are largely beyond domestic policy control. While groceries dominate household budgets, they are likely to remain the most stubborn part of the cost-of-living crisis. Energy costs Households are unlikely to see a repeat of universal energy credits. While many suppliers have announced price increases, the average cost of electricity, about €0.35 per unit, remains broadly similar to last year. Still, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has warned of growing arrears without targeted supports.

Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences From RTÉ Radio 1's Late Debate, will there be a budget response to rising energy prices? The Government is therefore more likely to direct relief through measures such as the fuel allowance rather than across-the-board credits. The reduced 9% VAT rate on energy, due to expire on October 30th, is also expected to be extended, but carbon tax increases will proceed, further raising fuel costs so no real reprieve can be expected here. VAT One way the Government may attempt to reduce costs for individual is through taxation costs for business. They are likely to reduce the hospitality VAT rate to 9%, but the specifics of this reduction are currently shrouded in uncertainty. There is potential to exclude large fast-food outlets from this and to delay implementation into 2026. Unfortunately, don't expect this to impact the price of your daily coffee. Hospitality has been crying out for this reduction to stave off financial ruin. With a spate of recent high-profile restaurant and café closures, this reduction would allow some breathing room for businesses, but is unlikely to be passed on to consumers.

In addition to this, the minimum wage is likely to increase to above €14 per hour in line with the Low Pay Commission recommendation. Effectively, any reduction in VAT will likely cover increased wages. Putting money in people's pockets The main way this budget is expected to assist with the cost of living is by attempting to put money back in people's pockets. Social welfare remains the Government's most direct tool for easing pressure on vulnerable households. While early talk of a €12 weekly rise has been scaled back, an increase of around €10 is more likely. Broader adjustments to means-testing thresholds could also bring more families into the system. These changes, though modest, would provide the most immediate benefit to those most in need. Childcare is another major cost for households and has been the subject of repeated promises. The Government pledged to cap weekly fees at €200, but delivery has lagged. Budget 2026 may only reduce the cap to €295, well short of the target. As with housing, the Government risks being judged on missed targets. The Government is likely to increase the Rent Tax Credit by €500 per person. Given the constraints of the available tax cuts, they will not wish to allot a large chunk of its available leeway here and spread benefits too thinly. This commitment meets Fine Gael's election promise, and they will likely cite changes to rent pressure zones as vain hope that rents will stabilise.

For workers, income tax adjustments are expected to follow the pattern of recent years. The threshold for the higher rate is likely to rise by about €1,000 to €45,000, alongside a possible increase in the PAYE credit. These measures will offer some relief to middle-income earners, though far less than the pressures of food, rent or energy bills. 'The real challenge lies beyond this year' While some areas of the cost-of-living crisis lie outside direct Government influence (grocery prices cannot be directly influenced), the Government will hope that addressing the cost of doing business will stabilise costs. For individuals, the Government is unwilling to continue broad-based measures like universal energy credits. These are politically popular but fiscally expensive and run counter to advice to target supports to those most vulnerable. Other measures are obligatory. Carbon tax increases are locked in, and further rises are expected in excise duties on tobacco alongside the planned introduction of a new tax on vaping products. If there is a brighter note, it is the Government's growing willingness to prioritise long-term investment over short-term giveaways. Significant allocations from the €9bn are expected for multi-year projects in water, waste and health infrastructure, areas where Ireland has long lagged behind.

Households should not expect sweeping relief, while businesses will see only limited supports. Those most likely to benefit are the most vulnerable through social welfare. It is likely that incomes will slightly increase through lower taxes, and grocery bills should slow their exponential growth, but costs are unlikely to fall. Yet the real challenge lies beyond this year. Without broader reforms - such as reviewing welfare thresholds, adjusting tax bands more systematically and reducing overreliance on volatile corporate tax receipts - budgets will remain exercises in patching holes rather than planning for the future.

Sterling Bank Gifts Nigerians on Independence Day,"Sterling Bank has once again redefined the boundaries of customer-first banking in Nigeria by scrapping Account Maintenance Fees (AMF) across all personal accounts. Just months after abolishing transfer fees on local online transactions in April 2025, the bank has dismantled yet another long-standing industry practice, cementing its role as the nation's leading force for transparent, fair and customer-focused banking. This decision cuts at the heart of a revenue model that has long cost Nigerian customers dearly. In 2024 alone, tier-1 banks raked in over N650 billion from account maintenance and e-banking charges. Sterling's move rewrites Nigeria's banking rulebook while amplifying its bold stance: customers deserve freedom from too many deductions and the right to keep more of their hard-earned money. The Managing Director of Sterling Bank, Abubakar Suleiman, explained the principle driving this bold action: ""Every fee we remove is one less barrier between our customers and true financial freedom. This was the rationale behind eliminating transfer fees in April, and it is the same principle we uphold as we eliminate account maintenance fees."" The Growth Executive for Consumer and Business Banking at Sterling Bank, Obinna Ukachukwu, reinforced this position: ""This initiative is about building lasting relationships that fuel sustainable growth. We put transparency and customer value first, and in doing so, we are building a foundation that serves both our customers and Sterling's future."" As Nigeria marks another Independence Day, Sterling Bank presents this decision as a declaration of financial independence for millions of Nigerians. By freeing customers from deductions that silently erode their balances, Sterling is empowering them to keep and grow their wealth while redefining true financial freedom. With two unprecedented moves in quick succession, the removal of transfer fees in April and now the elimination of account maintenance charges, Sterling Bank continues to challenge the status quo and champion a new era of fairness in Nigerian banking. Sterling Bank is a forward-thinking financial institution committed to transforming lives through innovative solutions, exceptional service, unwavering integrity and a steadfast focus on its HEART strategy. As pioneers in digital banking and financial inclusion, Sterling continues to lead by example, proving that purpose-driven leadership can unlock transformative outcomes for individuals, businesses and society at large.",THISDAYLIVE,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.thisdaylive.com/2025/10/01/sterling-bank-gifts-nigerians-on-independence-day/,2025-10-01 17:26:52.695337,0.2941176470588236

"Acba Bank supports establishment of more than 1,240 hectares of intensive gardens","In Armenia, over 225,000 individuals are involved in agriculture; however, the impacts of climate change are presenting significant challenges, including water shortages, droughts, and hailstorms. YEREVAN, October 1. /ARKA/. In Armenia, over 225,000 individuals are involved in agriculture; however, the impacts of climate change are presenting significant challenges, including water shortages, droughts, and hailstorms. The Asian Development Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Armenia, hosted a panel discussion addressing the challenges of mitigating climate risks. This event included participation from financial institutions, farmers, and experts, all aimed at identifying potential effective solutions. Intensive gardening has emerged as a key focus area in Armenia for achieving climate adaptation. With the assistance of ACBA Bank, approximately 1,244 hectares of intensive gardens have been developed in recent years, alongside the implementation of modern irrigation systems and hail protection networks. The bank has allocated around 18 billion AMD for these initiatives over the past five years. ""We prioritize all initiatives aimed at adapting the agricultural sector to climate change. In this context, hail protection networks, drip irrigation systems, and specially constructed lakes adjacent to farms, which are utilized by drip irrigation systems, are indispensable. We encourage our clients to recognize the significance of investing in these systems, as such investments are crucial and worthwhile. A few years ago, prior to these initiatives, we aimed to transform agriculture into a business that would attract not only rural residents but also urban dwellers to engage in agricultural activities in the regions,"" stated Arsen Melkonyan, Director of Retail Business and Deputy CEO of ACBA Bank. ""The effects of climate change are evident in Armenia, presenting significant risks. Concurrently, the increasing demand for water, both for ecological purposes and for drinking, influences the management of the country's resources. Nevertheless, Armenia possesses vast potential to emerge as one of the leading agricultural producers in the region. The peaches and apricots from Armenia are exceptionally flavorful, and there is an opportunity for the country to establish them as an international brand. The Asian Development Bank is prepared to extend its support to ensure that these products gain international branding and recognition,"" stated Yasmin Siddique, Director of the ADB Agriculture, Food, Nature and Rural Development Sector.

"'Higher risk of misuse': MSF to stop use of Child Development Account money at optical shops, retail pharmacies","SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will stop the use of Child Development Account (CDA) money at optical shops and retail pharmacies after recent audits found a ""significantly higher risk of misuse"" at such establishments. This includes cases where establishments allow parents or trustees to encash the CDA funds, even though it is prohibited. The CDA is a special co-savings account with government co-matching, and the funds can be used to pay for approved expenses for the child or the child's siblings. MSF said it conducts periodic audits and checks to ensure that CDA funds are used for authorised purposes only. On top of that, the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) audited selected parenthood schemes, including withdrawals made by parents and trustees. The AGO had found ""poor record keeping and unusual patterns of CDA withdrawals"" at optical shops and retail pharmacies, including ""frequent withdrawals within a short period"" and purchases that do not appear to be for the child or the child's siblings. MSF's follow-up investigations revealed instances where the money was used on purchases for adults instead. Some establishments also allowed parents or trustees to encash CDA money. The ministry's internal audit of 30 optical shops in 2024 found that over 85 per cent of outlets audited had similar unauthorised purchases. Operators of optical shops and retail pharmacies also provided feedback that it is ""challenging and onerous"" to conduct the required point-of-sales checks on CDA transactions, given the retail nature of the business, said MSF. The ministry added that usage at optical shops and retail pharmacies has been ""very low"", comprising 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent of total CDA spending in 2024 respectively. It also noted that most of the money were spent at preschools, including kindergartens, and healthcare institutions, accounting for 97.1 per cent of the total spending in 2024. Retail pharmacies refer to licensed pharmacy stores selling prescribed medication and health-related products, such as those located in commercial spaces like shopping centres. The change will not affect pharmacy departments within healthcare institutions, such as hospitals and polyclinics, said MSF. It added that CDA funds can continue to be used for prescribed medication and consultation fees at those institutions, as well as General Practitioner clinics that are Baby Bonus Approved Institutions. ""The government remains committed to supporting families with child-raising costs through measures such as the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child LifeSG Credits, and the new Large Families Scheme,"" said MSF, adding that families who need financial support can approach Social Service Offices for assistance. The ministry noted that since May 2025, the scope of CDA use has been expanded to include ""incidental charges at preschools to better meet families' needs and support the child's participation in a broader range of developmental activities"". Such programmes include enrichment classes in preschools, such as in speech and drama. ""The government will continue to review the administration of the CDA to ensure that the scheme remains relevant and achieves its intended purpose to benefit the child and his/her sibling(s).""",CNA,2025-10-01T09:16:47Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/child-development-account-discontinue-use-optical-shops-retail-pharmacies-msf-5379391,2025-10-01 17:26:54.859698,0.08235294117647052
"B Lab Africa Summit 2025 to Feature High-Level Panel Discussions on Agriculture, Green Finance, Education, Technology and Renewable Energy - SHOWBIZ SCOPE","The 4th Annual B Lab Africa Summit, taking place on 2-3 October 2025 at the Serengeti Golf and Wildlife Estate in Johannesburg, will convene policymakers, business leaders, academics, and innovators to address Africa's readiness to take decisive action on climate, inclusive growth, and sustainability. A central feature of the Summit will be five panel discussions designed to provide practical insights and highlight African-led solutions to some of the continent's most urgent development priorities. Panel Highlights: The Business of Agriculture Agriculture remains Africa's largest source of livelihoods, employing more than 60% of the population. Yet, it faces rising challenges of food insecurity, climate variability, and land degradation. This panel will explore how the sector can transition from subsistence to sustainability by balancing food security, regenerative practices, and profitability. It will also address how agribusiness and smallholder farmers can play a central role in Africa's economic growth story. Unlocking Green Finance for SMEs & Navigating Trade Africa requires an estimated $277 billion annually until 2030 to implement climate solutions, yet access to finance remains limited for SMEs, the backbone of Africa's economy. This session will focus on the capital flows required for Africa's green transition, exploring innovative financing mechanisms, blended finance, and trade facilitation that can open pathways for small and medium enterprises to access billions in climate and trade-related finance. Educating the Future By 2050, Africa will be home to the world's largest youth population. However, a mismatch between education systems and labour market needs persists. This panel will examine how to reshape education and skills development to equip young Africans for the jobs of the future, including those in green industries and digital economies. It will also highlight partnerships between governments, private sector players, and educational institutions that are redefining workforce readiness. Data & Technology - Securing Sustainability Through AI From precision agriculture to smart energy grids, technology and artificial intelligence are emerging as tools to accelerate Africa's sustainable development. This panel will explore how data and AI can democratise access to opportunities, increase accountability, and strengthen governance, while also safeguarding against risks such as bias and unequal access. The session will focus on Africa-specific use cases where technology is being deployed to secure inclusive, sustainable growth. Powering the Transition - Renewable Energy for a Resilient Africa More than 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity, while climate impacts continue to threaten energy security. This discussion will showcase African-led renewable energy solutions from solar and wind to mini-grids that are enabling resilience, driving industrialisation, and expanding inclusive energy access. It will also assess the role of policy, investment and innovation in powering Africa's transition to a climate-resilient energy future. ""These panel discussions are designed not only to debate but to drive tangible action,"" said Lucy Muigai, CEO of B Lab Africa. ""Each session will draw on African realities, opportunities, and leadership, ensuring the continent's growth story is anchored in sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity."" The B Lab Africa Summit is widely regarded as a premier platform for businesses, investors, and policymakers committed to building an equitable and sustainable Africa. Through these high-level discussions, participants will gain deeper insights into solutions shaping the continent's future and have the opportunity to collaborate on pathways for change.

Against Regulations: Restaurant,"The parliamentary restaurant ""Kelsen"" has lost the Austrian Eco-label. The reason is violations of criteria such as regionality and organic quality. A recertification is planned. The restaurant ""Kelsen"" in the parliament in Vienna has lost the Austrian Eco-label and thus also did not comply with the guidelines of the High House, reports the weekly newspaper ""Falter"" in its current issue. Invoices would prove that products purchased in wholesale did not meet the corresponding guidelines. The restaurant stated in a statement that there were individual irregularities, and they are working on recertification. Boiled beef from Holland, fish from Asia: Criticism of ""Kelsen"" According to ""Falter"", with gilthead sea bream fillets from Turkey, pike-perch from Kazakhstan, shrimp from Bangladesh, boiled beef from the Netherlands, or spring rolls from China, the requirement of regionality and organic quality was allegedly violated. A fine of 5,000 euros is threatened for the alleged guideline violation. ""Whether there is a conscious non-compliance is being examined,"" said the parliamentary directorate, which is in exchange with ""Kelsen"" and those responsible for the Eco-label. It is awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the process is handled by the Association for Consumer Information. ""Not the daily purchasing practice"" In a written statement from the restaurant, it was said that they take the allegations very seriously. The mentioned cases concern individual products, specifically 1.8 percent of the goods used, and do not reflect the daily purchasing practice. Measures for correction have already been implemented. The affected products have been removed from the offer, strict internal procurement controls have been introduced, a sustainability training has been held, and a binding set of rules has been created. They look forward to a renewed examination for the recertification of the Austrian Eco-label with confidence, it was said in conclusion. A rapid increase in the organic share is also being pursued and is in implementation. Scarlet runner bean falafel caused problems The ""Kelsen"" had already attracted negative attention once before. In the summer of 2023, several guests complained of stomach and intestinal problems after consuming a scarlet runner bean dish. At that time, it was suspected not to be a hygiene problem, but an error in the preparation of scarlet runner bean falafel. The beans contain the toxic substance phasin, which must be cooked out.

African industries face shock as AGOA expires under Trump,"African apparel and textile manufacturers will be the hardest hit by the end of the US tariff-free trade scheme. Africa's apparel and textile manufacturers - already reeling from US tariffs - will be hardest hit by the end of the US's tariff-free African Growth and Opportunity Act, according to research by the International Trade Center (ITC). AGOA, which has provided dozens of African countries with tariff-free access to the US market since it was signed into US law in 2000, was allowed to lapse on September 30 by the Trump administration, bringing an end to preferences for 32 countries, of whom 22 qualified for apparel provisions. Across all sectors, tariff measures introduced in 2025 are estimated to reduce projected exports of AGOA beneficiaries by about 8% by 2029. The expiry of AGOA adds a further decline of 0.6 percentage points, or $189m. $138m of that will be accounted for by reductions in exports of apparel and textile products to the United States, which are expected to register a decline of 9.7% by 2029 as a result of the end of AGOA, by far the greatest impact on any sector. Skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (-3.3%), processed food and animal feed (-1.6%) and vehicles (-1.3%) are the next most affected. The ITC says the expiry of AGOA will increase duties in value-added and labour-intensive sectors that had benefited most from preferential access. The steepest hikes are observed in apparel & textile products (+14 percentage points), skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (+4.3) and processed food & animal feed (+2.4), where competitiveness has relied heavily on duty-free entry under AGOA. In recent months, the administration has hit African and non-African countries with tariffs, further exacerbating the impact of the end of AGOA. For the apparel industry, the 14 percentage point increase from the end of AGOA combined with the 13 percentage point increase from 2025 tariffs leads to a total tariff increase of 27 percentage points. AGOA contained special provisions for textiles and apparel, including the ""third-country fabric allowance."" This rule, available only to ""least developed"" countries approved for apparel eligibility, allowed them to source fabric globally while still exporting finished apparel duty-free to the United States. It was instrumental in enabling countries such as Lesotho, Kenya and Madagascar to establish competitive apparel industries. More advanced economies such as South Africa and Mauritius, while granted apparel eligibility, did not benefit from the third-country fabric allowance and were subject to stricter rules of origin requiring fabric sourced from the United States or other AGOA beneficiaries. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the ITC, said the end of AGOA and the introduction of US tariffs could have a devastating impact on apparel exporters. ""If AGOA were to lapse, it will deal a blow to African countries already feeling the weight of new trade measures, from the latest tariffs to sustainability requirements. Access to key markets is becoming more difficult, and African countries - especially the least developed - are feeling the strain. Take Lesotho. Nearly 60% of its apparel exports go to the US, worth over $230m annually. Under AGOA, those goods entered the US market duty-free. Today, they face a 15% tariff. That may sound small, compared with the initial 50%, but this move has led to cancelled orders, lost jobs and reduced competitiveness vis-à-vis neighbours like Kenya and Eswatini, which face a 10% rate. Lesotho's textile industry employs 40,000 people. This is affecting real people, real lives.""",African Business,2025-10-01T09:20:54Z,https://african.business/2025/10/trade-investment/african-industries-face-shock-as-agoa-expires-under-trump,2025-10-01 17:26:54.862226,0.2156862745098038
'State of calamity' as earthquake kills 69 in Philippines province,"The earthquake comes barely more than a week after the country was hit by back-to-back typhoons which killed more than a dozen people. Most of the victims were from Bogo city, a small town on one of the largest islands in the Visayas Islands, the Philippines' central region - and the place closest to the earthquake's epicentre. Images coming out of Bogo show cadaver bags lined on the street and hundreds being treated in tent hospitals. Officials have warned of ""a lot of damage"" caused by the earthquakes. The local authorities have appealed for volunteers with medical experience to help deal with injuries. Buckled and cracked roads, and fallen bridges are also making access difficult for emergency services. Power lines in many places are down, meaning that it's also been hard to speak to those affected. Seven of those who died in Tuesday's earthquake in Bogo had lived in a village built to house victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the central Philippines 12 years ago killing more than 6,000 people. In the municipality of San Remigio, a basketball game was ongoing when the earthquake struck, an emergency response official told the BBC. Almost 20 people at the game were sent to the hospital, and at least one person later died. Aside from the 30 reported deaths in Bogo, there were 22 known deaths in San Remigio, 10 in Medellin, five in Tubogon and one each in Sogod and Tabuelan towns, said the country's Office of Civil Defence. Officials from the national police and fire bureau say they are prioritising search and rescue operations, rushing to restore electricity and delivering relief supplies to those affected. On Wednesday evening, Bogo was hit by yet another aftershock, this one at a magnitude of 4.7, with tremors felt in Cebu city and the neighbouring Leyte islands. There were no known casualties.

Nigeria @65: Tinubu pledges continued support for Nigerian youths - Blueprint Newspapers Limited,"President Bola Tinubu has reaffirmed his administration's commitment to creating an enabling environment for Nigerian youths to thrive, describing them as the country's greatest assets and the future of the nation. In his Independence Day address on Wednesday, October 1, 2025, Tinubu urged young Nigerians to keep dreaming big, innovating, and breaking new grounds in science, technology, sports, and the creative industries. ""Our administration, through policies and funding, will continue to give you wings to fly sky-high,"" the President said. Highlighting the government's interventions, Tinubu disclosed that the Nigeria Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) had provided financial assistance to about 510,000 students across 36 states and the FCT, covering 228 higher institutions. As of September 10, N99.5 billion had been disbursed as loans, while N44.7 billion went into upkeep allowances. He also noted that the Credit Corporation of Nigeria (Credicorp) had granted N30 billion in affordable loans to 153,000 Nigerians for vehicles, solar energy, home upgrades, digital devices, and other essentials. On youth empowerment, the President pointed out that YouthCred, launched in June, had already enabled thousands of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members to access consumer credit to support their resettlement. Reiterating his Renewed Hope Agenda, Tinubu said the administration's Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises (iDICE) programme was now at the threshold of implementation. The initiative, driven by the Bank of Industry in partnership with the African Development Bank, French Development Agency, and Islamic Development Bank, aims to boost opportunities in Nigeria's growing technology and creative industries. ""Over the last two years, we have collaborated with our partners to launch the programme, supporting our young builders and dreamers in the technology and creative sectors,"" Tinubu stated.",Blueprint Newspapers Limited,2025-10-01T09:16:13Z,https://blueprint.ng/nigeria-65-tinubu-pledges-continued-support-for-nigerian-youths/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.863044,0.4274509803921569

I understand I can opt out at any time through an email that I receive, or by clicking here As soon as she fell, Deborah Buttgereit knew she couldn't avoid going to the hospital. ""I could hear the bones moving around in my elbow,"" said Buttgereit, who was 60 when she slipped on a patch of ice in December outside her apartment in Bozeman, Montana. Emergency room scans showed she had fractured her left arm near the joint. Doctors told her she needed surgery to repair it. At the time, Buttgereit didn't have health insurance -- she had struggled to afford coverage after her husband's death. The local health system, Bozeman Health, estimated Buttgereit would have to pay $50,560 out-of-pocket for the outpatient surgery to have her elbow pieced back together. The estimate noted: ""You could be charged more if complications or special circumstances occur."" Four days after her fall, Buttgereit went in for surgery, which took about three hours. During a follow-up visit, she said, her doctor told her the procedure ended up being more complicated than expected. Buttgereit broke her humerus, the upper-arm bone that meets two other bones and forms the elbow. The way the bone splintered is known as a distal humerus fracture. It's rare as far as breaks go, accounting for only about 2% of all fractures among adults. But older people, as well as kids in high-contact sports, are more prone to the big falls that lead to such fractures. The injury is painful and can make it impossible to move the elbow. Some of these types of fractures heal with time in a splint, but most often surgery is the only fix. The patient is put under anesthesia while a surgeon repositions fragmented bones with plates and screws. The Final Bill $97,998. That includes at least $44,300 for the operating room and anesthesia administration, plus more than $50,000 for medical supplies and implants, such as screws and plates. After the hospital applied a self-pay discount, Buttgereit was on the hook for $78,398.40. The Problem: Surprise Complications, Surprising Charges The hospital said the price for Buttgereit's surgery increased because doctors encountered complications midprocedure. In particular, the fall had shattered Buttgereit's bone into more pieces than her surgeon anticipated, according to operating notes. That meant it took more time, skill, and supplies to reconstruct her elbow. And, since she was uninsured, Buttgereit alone faced the burden to pay the higher costs. ""I'll make payments the rest of my life to pay it all off,"" she said. Buttgereit's husband died suddenly in 2023. About a year later, she left her job with the company that had employed them both. The memories of him in that space were too difficult, she said. That also meant leaving behind her health coverage. She moved to Bozeman to be closer to one of her daughters and found a health plan at healthcare.gov that the federal government subsidized because of her limited income. But she also faced a higher cost of living in Bozeman than her Social Security benefits could cover, and she needed part-time work. While that new income helped pay her bills, Buttgereit said, she no longer qualified for the same level of subsidized coverage and couldn't afford her plan. So she dropped her health insurance. About two months later, she fell. After getting the surgery bill, Buttgereit began calling and emailing the hospital's customer service team, asking how the price had risen from the $50,560 estimate to nearly $98,000. The hospital had automatically applied the self-pay discount of $19,600 to Buttgereit's bill -- 20% of the total. But that still left her with a tab of more than $78,000. After more time to think pain-free, she said, she also wanted to know why the initial estimate was much steeper than those she found online for similar procedures. Specifically, Buttgereit asked how to dispute her bill. When she felt she wasn't making progress contesting the charges with the hospital, she asked about her options under the No Surprises Act, a federal consumer protection law. According to emails reviewed by KFF Health News, a Bozeman Health billing employee incorrectly told Buttgereit the law applies only to ER services. The employee later said Buttgereit had the right to dispute the bill but gave her an incorrect deadline. Hospital staffers recommended Buttgereit set up a payment plan and apply to the health system's financial aid program. Erin Schaible, a spokesperson with Bozeman Health, told KFF Health News that online estimates don't reflect the specific details of a patient's care. In addition to the shattered bones noted in Buttgereit's surgery notes, Schaible said the physician identified nerve damage midsurgery that required additional work to fix. ""This situation highlights the importance of clear and compassionate communication,"" Schaible said. ""In response, our team leaders are revising internal protocols for escalating patient concerns and are reeducating staff on best practices for communicating cost estimate changes."" The Resolution Buttgereit refused to apply for financial aid, opting instead to challenge what she sees as inflated pricing. Using Healthcare Bluebook, an online price comparison tool that draws on insurance claims data, Buttgereit found similar procedures ranged from $8,000 to $40,000. She said she believes that there are also errors on her bill and that the complications didn't justify the price. ""I felt like going through financial assistance means that I'm OK with the price of the bill,"" she said. ""I want to get the bill reduced on the front end and then, if I need financial assistance, go through it."" A billing employee emailed Buttgereit in May to offer an additional $7,000 discount if she set up a payment plan. If she later qualified for financial assistance, ""we will adjust the amount accordingly,"" the email said. In June, the employee told Buttgereit her account would be put on hold before a collection process was initiated, ""so that you have time to decide what to do."" Buttgereit agreed to a payment plan of $100 a month, though she continued to contest the total charges. At that rate, it would take about 60 years to pay off the debt -- or longer, if the health system were to charge interest. Buttgereit made one more bid for help: She emailed the White House. This month, in the same week she got a detailed letter from the hospital standing by its charges, Buttgereit said she received a call from an official with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, saying she could dispute the bill to federal health officials. The Takeaway The best time to push back against a price is before surgery, upon receiving a hospital's best guess on costs, known as a ""good faith estimate."" Otherwise, undergoing surgery is considered tacit acceptance of that price as a baseline. Patricia Kelmar, director of health care campaigns at the national consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG, follows ways in which people get tangled financially in the health industry. She said patients should compare cost estimates by searching their hospital's online pricing tool (as well as those of nearby hospitals) to see whether the estimates align. But not every procedure makes those lists, especially those for uncommon injuries, nor is every hospital's list easy to access and navigate. Post-surgery, patients have few resources to fight big bills, but a little-known rule in the No Surprises Act could help, Kelmar said. The law, which took effect in 2022, is best known for protecting patients from surprise bills for out-of-network, emergency care. But it also created a formal dispute process for uninsured patients, or those paying completely out-of-pocket for nonemergency procedures, if their final tab is $400 or more than the initial estimate. ""This is a valid, important part of making sure that patients who are cash-pay have a watchdog,"" Kelmar said. People can start the patient-provider dispute process online, through the CMS website, by providing medical records and paying a $25 fee. Patients must initiate the process within 120 days of receiving the bill, and the bill may not be sent to a collection agency while under review. An independent reviewer evaluates whether the final price is drastically different from what a health insurance company would have paid and whether the complication was predictable. If the review finds that the health provider erred on either front, federal health officials could require them to reduce the bill to match the original estimate or the median price insurers pay. Buttgereit said she initially opted against pursuing that formal dispute process because, after such a review, the floor would be the hospital's initial estimate, and she still had questions about how it would work. But after hearing from CMS, Buttgereit said it's the path she plans to take. ""You've got to fight for yourself,"" she said. ""I don't know where this is going to end up, but I feel a little bit more hopeful."" ____ Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills.

RBI to issue draft ECL norms for banks soon,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon issue Expected Credit Loss (ECL) norms for banks and all-India financial institutions to align Indian banks' provisioning norms with global standards. ""With a view to strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, it is proposed to issue the draft Reserve Bank (Asset Classification, Provisioning and Income Recognition) Directions, 2025, for Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Small Finance Banks, Payments Banks, and Regional Rural Banks) and All-India Financial Institutions,"" the RBI stated. The draft directions propose replacing the current incurred loss framework with an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach, subject to a prudential floor, while retaining the existing asset classification norms. The guidelines are expected to enhance banks' credit risk management practices and promote better comparability of reported financials across institutions. The framework is designed for implementation in a non-disruptive manner with a suitable glide path. Anil Gupta, senior VP and co-group head at ICRA Ratings, said ICRA had earlier projected a 300-400 basis point (bps) reduction in core capital ratio of banks upon implementation of Ind-AS, primarily accounting for the expected credit loss (ECL) effect. ""However, as against our earlier estimate of implementation from April 1, 2025, the proposed implementation from April 1, 2027 onwards will moderate the impact, given the consistent improvement in asset quality in recent years. Further, the phased rollout through FY2031, provides banks with greater flexibility to manage the associated provisioning requirements,"" he said.

"DGCA proposes easing wet lease rules, paving way for IndiGo and rivals to tackle aircraft shortage","The new draft proposal replaces the word ""only"" with ""normally"", making processing of such requests potentially easier, lawyers said. Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has proposed removing the mandate that airlines can only take planes on lease with crew in emergencies, draft regulations show, in a move that could make it easier for carriers to tide over any aircraft shortages. The proposed rules could help airlines like India's biggest carrier IndiGo, which has taken two planes with crew on so-called wet lease from Turkish Airlines, allowing it to offer connectivity with flights to Europe and the United States. The partnership has irked rival Air India, which unsuccessfully lobbied the Indian government to block it, arguing it gives more air traffic to Turkey and hurts India's aviation sector. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) regulations had permitted airlines to enter such leases only in emergency situations, such as unexpected grounding of aircraft. The new draft proposal replaces the word ""only"" with ""normally"", making processing of such requests potentially easier, lawyers said. ""This added flexibility could play a crucial role in easing capacity constraints, especially in light of the limited availability of larger aircraft,"" said Lovejeet Singh, a partner at law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan and specialist in aviation laws. The proposal was posted on DGCA's website earlier this week but has not previously been reported. It is open for public consultations until October 28. The DGCA and IndiGo did not respond to Reuters queries on the planned changes in regulations. IndiGo's Turkish partnership has faced criticism in India in recent months after Turkey came out in support of Pakistan during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. While the government first said it wouldn't extend that lease, it changed course in August without giving a reason to let IndiGo continue. The current DGCA regulations mandate airlines to only lease aircraft from countries where the average industry safety score is above 80%, but the new draft rules said the watchdog can exempt that requirement on a one-time basis.",MoneyControl,2025-10-01T09:20:23Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dgca-proposes-easing-wet-lease-rules-paving-way-for-indigo-and-rivals-to-tackle-aircraft-shortage-13592984.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.867110,0.1372549019607843

"Credit Card Fraud Escalates As Fraud Continues to Be a Concern for Canadians | Taiwan News | Oct. 1, 2025 17:00","- Identity fraud fuels sharp rise in credit card cases - - Equifax Canada Market Pulse Fraud Trends and Insights Report - TORONTO, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equifax Canada's Market Pulse Fraud Trends and Insights Report for the first half of 2025 reveals a sharp rise in credit card fraud, even as overall application fraud rates across Canada have fallen to their lowest point since Q3 2022. Nationally, application fraud rates dropped to 0.56 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, down from 0.70 per cent in the previous quarter and 0.57 per cent a year ago. This broad-based decline reflects easing consumer demand for credit products, stricter lending standards, and a cooling Canadian economy. However, the decline may also be masking a troubling trend as credit card fraud diverged sharply in Q2, with fraud rates rising to 0.75 per cent compared to 0.44 per cent a year earlier, despite a 1.4 per cent drop in application volumes. ""Fraudsters are no longer targeting specific consumer groups it seems, rather indiscriminately striking across the credit spectrum as of late,"" said Carl Davies, Head of Fraud & Identity at Equifax Canada. ""The surge in credit card fraud is concerning and requires vigilance from lenders, policymakers and consumers alike."" Credit card fraud surges Third-party fraud now drives 83 per cent of all fraudulent activity in the credit card sector, with true-identity fraud accounting for 78 per cent of those cases. The data indicates that fraudsters are increasingly targeting middle-aged Canadians, with the sharpest increases seen in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, regions where delinquency rates have risen above pre-pandemic levels. ""Credit cards remain a central point of vulnerability -- it's one area where fraudsters adapt rapidly, exploiting both gaps in verification and economic uncertainty among consumers,"" added Cherolle Prince, Director, Fraud Consulting at Equifax Canada. ""Even as other product lines show easing, the rise in credit card fraud underscores the urgency of investing in stronger identity verification, data sharing and cross-industry collaboration."" Persistent fraud threats First-party fraud, often linked to misrepresentation of financial circumstances, is seven per cent higher than a year ago. Outside of the credit card sector, third-party fraud declined both quarterly and annually, with identity theft continuing to drive most of the fraudulent activity. Auto fraud declined to 0.23 per cent from 0.26 per cent a year ago, while banking and deposits fraud dropped from 1.09 per cent to 0.70 per cent over the same period. Fraud among non-mortgage holders (a group that includes soon-to-be first-time buyers), stood at 0.22 per cent, compared to 0.16 per cent for mortgage holders, indicating that renters and first time home buyers need to take extra caution. Falsified documents on the rise While mortgage fraud fell to 0.19 per cent in Q2 2025, down from 0.29 per cent a year earlier, misrepresentation of financial circumstances, often in the form of falsified documents, continues to be a major source of fraud. This is particularly prevalent in mortgage fraud, where forged income and employment documents drove over 75 per cent of fraud cases. Income and employment fraud is also a major concern in the auto sector, where it makes up close to 30 per cent of fraud cases. ""As we look ahead, we typically see seasonal spikes in fraud toward the end of the year. Knowing this, we encourage Canadians to visit the Fraud and Identity Theft education hub on the Equifax website to learn more about the actions they can take to help protect themselves and their families from identity theft and fraud,"" concludes Davies.

The homegrown auto major was ahead of Mahindra (37,015 units) as well as Hyundai (35,443 units). Maruti's PV registrations came in at 1,22,278 units during the month. Tata sells ICE models like the Tiago hatchback, the Altroz hatchback, and the Tigor sedan. Among its ICE SUVs are the Punch, Nexon, Curvv, Harrier and Safari. Following the GST restructuring, the Tiago has received a price cut of up to Rs 75,000, the Altroz of up to Rs 1,11,000 and the Tigor of up to Rs 81,000. The price of the Punch has gone down by up to Rs 1,08,000, and that of the Nexon by up to Rs 1,55,000. The price cut on the Curvv, Harrier and Safari is up to Rs 67,000, Rs 1,44,000 and Rs 1,48,000, respectively. Tata also offers electric vehicles (EVs) like the Tiago.ev, Tigor.ev, Punch.ev, Nexon.ev, Curvv.ev and Harrier.ev. Maruti has reduced the price of its ICE cars by up to Rs 1,29,600, Mahindra by up to Rs 1,56,000 and Hyundai by up to Rs 2,40,000 in the GST 2.0 regime. Under the new GST structure, the relatively smaller ICE cars (sub-4 metre) are in the 18% slab, while the compensation cess on automobiles has been completely removed. They earlier attracted a GST of 28% and a compensation cess of 1% to 3%, resulting in a total tax incidence of 29% to 31%. The bigger ICE models, as well as the luxury ICE cars, have been placed in the 40% slab now. In the GST 1.0 regime, the overall tax on them was from 43% to 50% (28% GST + 15% to 22% compensation cess). While ICE cars across segments have become cheaper in the GST 2.0 regime due to a lower tax, all the companies are extending additional festive benefits to enhance sales.",MoneyControl,2025-10-01T09:20:23Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/automobile/tata-races-past-mahindra-hyundai-in-retail-sales-in-september-2025-article-13592957.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.868760,0.1215686274509804

Listed Indian real estate developers healthy despite market headwinds: Report,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) Despite various unfavourable developments, the relevant market for listed real estate developers is still healthy, and the second quarter of the current financial year (Q2 FY26) could bring back investor interest, changing the perception and a report said on Wednesday. High-level industry data till August suggests that volume demand increased year-on-year (YoY), although on a low base, it was impacted by elections last year. Meanwhile, launches were still slow as developers avoided the inauspicious days during the quarter. ""Yet our checks suggest that our covered developers combined pre-sales grew 64 per cent YoY,"" HSBC Global Investment Research said in a report. The new launches largely received a strong response, allowing them to sell a significant part of the projects during the period. According to the report, the sustenance sales were supportive and will be further supported by strong collections. ""We remain constructive on top residential developers. Pricing environment and upgrade demand in the premium segment (target market for listed developers) remain buoyant and support margins,"" the report stated. Low unsold inventory and strong balance sheet, coupled with large real estate regulatory authority (RERA) cash balances, continue to generate confidence among the home buyers, the report added. Large developers continue to gain market share driven by their ability to execute large and premium projects (which are in high demand). Domestic press and influencers have been very negative on Indian residential real estate. All three large markets have been impacted by the shadow of negativity. Additionally, the headline numbers also indicated a 15 per cent YoY decline in units sold in Q1 FY26. ""From a narrative perspective, while the National Capital Region (NCR) has been termed fragile and speculative, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is expected to be oversupplied with redevelopment projects, and Bengaluru is too weak on IT job losses and the potential threat of artificial intelligence (AI),"" the report noted.",Social News XYZ,2025-10-01T08:01:19Z,https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/10/01/listed-indian-real-estate-developers-healthy-despite-market-headwinds-report/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.870269,0.3803921568627451
SIFs face a bottleneck: Too few hands to sell India's newest funds,"For now, industry leaders are aligned that measured growth is not a weakness but a necessity. By steadily expanding distributor capacity and investing in training, AMCs are laying the groundwork for wider adoption. As funds begin to demonstrate performance, the hope is that, investor confidence too will follow. Despite a wave of recent launches by AMCs, the success of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) has hinged heavily on building a strong distribution capacity. With requirements of exams, training and preparedness slowing down growth, fund houses are now racing to expand capacity before investor demand gathers pace. Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), India's newest investment category, are entering the market but distribution network remains a key constraint. Only 1,500 distributors are currently certified to sell these products, reflecting the steep entry barrier as well as the early stage of the fund category. AMCs and industry bodies acknowledge the slow start but are pushing ahead with training and support to build a sustainable distribution base. Distributor pool playing catch-up Syed Hassan, Chief Program Officer at CAMS said the number of registered distributors has surged from 248 at the end of July to around 1,500 in just 50 days. ""We are seeing roughly one new registration per hour,"" he said, adding that the base could reach 3,000-5,000 by year-end. Most new sign-ups are individual distributors, though wealth platforms and banks are also entering. The total number of mutual fund distributors in India stand at nearly 2 lakh, but this may not be a fair comparison, given that mutual fund is a mass market product while SIFs are a sophisticated product targetting high networth individuals (HNIs). Niranjan Avasthi, Head of Product at Edelweiss MF, said the limited distributor pool must be seen in the context of the target market. ""SIFs are designed for ultra-HNIs, HNIs, and family offices, so even a small base can cater to large ticket sizes,"" he said. Quant Mutual Fund, along with SBI MF and Edelweiss, is among the first to bring products to market. DP Singh, Deputy MD and Joint CEO of SBI Mutual Fund said their initial focus will be on wealth management clients such as family offices, supported by distributor education. ""Our goal is to enable decisions on the merits of the product, not just because it's a new fund launch,"" he said. AMC-led training and support The complexity of SIFs has meant that certification has become the main bottleneck in expanding the distributor base. Passing the NISM XIII exam is mandatory, but limited slots, subject matter, and costs have slowed uptake. Several distributors are intimidated by the NSIM course that combines modules on equity, interest rate and currency derivatives. To address this, AMCs are rolling out structured engagement, training sessions, and knowledge resources to prepare distributors. The 'NISM Series XIII: Common Derivatives Certification' examination is designed for professionals working in the securities markets, involving derivatives trading and related activities, such as traders, dealers, and other associated persons working with registered intermediaries in the derivatives market. Mutual fund distributors selling specialized investment funds are also required to obtain it. Even within wealth tech distribution platforms, investor facing support roles (such as client services) and research teams are required to clear the exam. AMCs are taking steps to address this concern. SBI MF's DP Singh said, ""We will provide educational material across platforms so both investors and distributors can understand the products and make informed choices."" Mirae Asset, which is preparing to launch its first SIF, is also prioritising distributor readiness. ""Higher standards ensure stronger quality of distribution and ultimately build greater investor trust,"" said Suranjana Borthakur, Head of Distribution and Strategic Alliances. ""We are focused on structured training, resources, and handholding so distributors can approach investors with conviction."" AMFI Chair Venkat Chalasani noted that distributor registrations are rising steadily at about 500 a month, and special industry-wide measures could be introduced if required. Building confidence takes time Both industry experts and distributors agree that adoption will remain gradual until SIFs establish a performance track record. Santosh Joseph of Germinate Investment Services compared the rollout to the slow and steady rollout of AIFs in 2013-14. Scripbox's Sachin Jain added that the product's availability will be critical, ""Once a ready pipeline exists, the distribution community will follow."" Ionic Wealth's Dharmendra Jain said platforms are already enabling SIF investments and collaborating with AMCs through knowledge sessions. ""It's a coming of age for Indian markets and we feel that this category will grow significantly soon,"" he said. For now, measured growth is not being seen as weakness but a necessity. By steadily expanding distributor capacity and investing in training, AMCs are laying the groundwork for wider adoption.

New York AG James sues Homeland Security for nearly $34 million over transit funding freeze,"(Reuters) -New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday filed a lawsuit and an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the department, accusing them of unlawfully withholding nearly $34 million in funding requested by the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MTA is the state agency that operates New York City's subway and buses, as well as commuter rail lines that serve nearby suburbs. In a late Tuesday lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York James is seeking an emergency order by midnight to safeguard the MTA's funding. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. ""DHS today cut New York's award from nearly $34 million to zero - an unlawful decision,"" her press office said in a statement, adding that James is not seeking disbursement tonight, only preservation of the funds while the courts resolve the case. The move, James said, jeopardizes the safety of millions of New Yorkers. ""I am asking the court to act before midnight to stop these funds from vanishing and to ensure that New Yorkers are not put at risk by this administration's political games,"" James said. Last month, the U.S. Transportation Department said it may withhold up to 25% of federal transit funding for the MTA if the agency does not improve safety for subway track maintenance workers.

AfricInvest Europe Reaches €50m in Initial Closing for 3rd Franco-African Fund.,"* First investments from FFA 3 are expected in early 2026, according to AfricInvest Europe. * AfricInvest Europe targets 13 transactions with Franco-African Fund 3. * The fund reached €50m in its first closing, with a final target of between €100m and €150m. AfricInvest Europe, the French subsidiary of the pan-African investment group AfricInvest and licensed by the AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers), announced the first closing of its Franco-African Fund 3 (FFA 3) at €50 million. According to the company, this marks the operational launch of the third generation of the fund, initially created in 2017 to channel French investment into Africa. With this first tranche, AfricInvest Europe reports that its assets under management now total approximately €150 million. AfricInvest Europe states that the FFA 3 will target between 10 and 12 French companies, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and mid-sized companies (ETIs), which already operate in Africa or plan to expand their operations there. The investment strategy focuses primarily on equity financing. The firm anticipates a final closing by the end of 2026, with a potential size of €100 to €150 million, contingent upon the participation of additional private and institutional investors. The fund is described as aiming to support companies with annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) exceeding €2 million and demonstrating strong growth trajectories. AfricInvest has highlighted priority sectors including health and pharmaceuticals, industry and logistics, renewable energy, and education or digital technologies. While the fund is presented as pan-African, AfricInvest identifies West and North Africa as the likely focal regions, with some allocation also made towards East and Southern Africa. Institutional partners play a significant role in the structure. Proparco, the private sector arm of the French Development Agency (AFD), has supported the Franco-African Fund series since its inception. Its financial contribution to FFA 3 has not been disclosed, but AfricInvest notes that Proparco also brings expertise in governance and operations in sub-Saharan Africa. Bpifrance, the French public investment bank, is also participating again as a co-founder and anchor investor, continuing its role from the earlier funds. AfricInvest has also cited commitments from private groups, including Société Générale, BNP Paribas, and Orange. The earlier funds, FFA 1, launched in 2017, and FFA 2, launched in 2020, each raised around €70 million, according to AfricInvest. Together, they financed 18 French companies with activities on the continent, and AfricInvest claims that the combined effect leveraged more than €200 million through co-investments and bank financing. One example cited by the firm is the French industrial company Mathevon, which has operated a plant in Tunisia since 2010. AfricInvest reported that its exit from this investment in May 2025 generated a 25 percent increase in valuation. The new fund is being launched against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty in parts of Africa. Independent observation reveals that French investors might face risks linked to currency volatility and competition from Chinese-backed initiatives, such as the Belt and Road. AfricInvest has stated that it applies due diligence procedures to manage these risks, including country risk assessments, currency hedging mechanisms, and compliance with environmental, social, and governance criteria. AfricInvest Europe states that the FFA 3 could make its first investments in the first quarter of 2026, with individual tickets expected to be in the range of €5 to €8 million. The scale of the fund's impact will depend on whether it reaches its final target size and succeeds in attracting further co-investors.",Ecofin Agency,2025-10-01T09:20:34Z,https://www.ecofinagency.com/news-finances/0110-49165-africinvest-europe-reaches-50m-in-initial-closing-for-3rd-franco-african-fund,2025-10-01 17:26:54.872692,0.1764705882352942
Argentina wins US-China trade war with a $20 bn bailout and soaring soyabean sale,"A worker carries a sack of soybeans at a food wholesale market in Shenyang, Liaoning province. Reuters The ongoing trade war between the US and China has thrown up an unexpected winner: Argentina. In a geopolitical triangle that few predicted, the United States has extended a $20 billion bailout to Argentina, China has redirected its soybean purchases away from American farmers and Argentine exporters have seized the opportunity to capture a key share of the world's largest soybean market. This alignment has left US farmers fuming, the Trump administration internally divided and China with greater leverage in its confrontation with Washington. Soybeans sit at the heart of the US-China trade dispute. For decades, American growers supplied China, the world's top soybean consumer, with tens of millions of tonnes each year. That flow has been cut off. Since May, Chinese importers have ceased all purchases of US soybeans, retaliating against tariffs imposed by Washington. As a result, American exports to their single largest customer have evaporated creating a glut at home and plunging prices on the Chicago Board of Trade. This vacuum has been filled by South America. Brazil, already a dominant supplier to China, booked 12 million tonnes of soybeans for shipment in late 2025. Now, Argentina has moved aggressively into the same space aided by favourable government policies and a timely surge in Chinese demand. In mid-September, President Javier Milei's government temporarily suspended export taxes on soybeans, corn, wheat, and their by-products. Levies as high as 26 percent on raw soybeans and 24.5 percent on soybean oil and meal were suddenly cut to zero. The result was a flood of declared sales. Within just two days, Argentina booked nearly $7 billion in grain exports, more than half of which were soybeans bound for China (South China Morning Post, 2025). The tax holiday coincided with a landmark deal in New York, where US President Donald Trump promised Buenos Aires a $20 billion financial package. Designed to stabilise the peso and shore up reserves, the bailout was also intended to curb Argentina's economic reliance on Beijing. But the immediate effect was least to say paradoxical. Argentine soybeans, suddenly cheaper and tax-free, became the prime choice for Chinese buyers seeking to sidestep US suppliers. The response from Beijing was swift. Within days, around 40 cargos -- 2.66 million tonnes of soybeans -- were booked for shipment in November and December, with most of the volume headed directly to Chinese ports. These sales represented more than half of China's near-term demand and pushed Argentina's soybean export orders to a seven-year high. China has obviously shown intent to avoid US supplies. Last year, China imported 105 million tonnes of soybeans, including 22 million from the US. But this season, Chinese traders have indicated they may rely almost entirely on South America until Brazil's next harvest arrives in early 2026. For Argentina, the shift translates into billions of dollars in new revenue, while for Washington, it represents both a political and economic setback. The bailout has triggered anger among US farmers, who see themselves as collateral damage in the geopolitical struggle. The American Soybean Association (ASA) has openly criticised Washington's decision, warning that the $20 billion lifeline to Buenos Aires effectively subsidises a competitor while US producers are left with falling prices and shrinking markets. Soybean futures in Chicago have already slid to $10.10 per bushel, pressured by Argentina's sudden export surge and the absence of Chinese buyers. Harvest season in the Midwest has compounded the problem, as silos fill with unsold crops and buyers remain scarce. Farmers in key states like Iowa, Indiana, and Minnesota -- longstanding Republican constituencies -- have expressed alarm that federal subsidies cannot replace the long-term demand from China. The fallout has not been limited to rural America. Divisions within the Trump administration have deepened in recent weeks, as images circulated of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reading a text message at the UN General Assembly. The message, reportedly forwarded by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, lamented that the US had bailed out Argentina only for Buenos Aires to remove export tariffs, reducing prices for China at a time when US farmers would normally be selling. The text warned bluntly: ""This gives China more leverage on us."" The leak highlighted tensions within the administration, where some officials see the bailout as a strategic move to limit Chinese influence in South America, while others view it as a direct blow to US farmers. The dynamic is clear. China's boycott of US soybeans has not only hurt American producers but has allowed Argentina to strengthen its ties with Beijing despite Washington's financial intervention. While the bailout was tied to conditions such as dismantling Argentina's $18 billion currency swap line with China, the immediate reality is that Chinese buyers are filling their silos with Argentine grain, not American. For Beijing, the strategy is doubly effective. By turning towards Argentina, it secures essential supplies while driving a wedge between Washington and its farm lobby. For Buenos Aires, the surge in soybean exports provides a much-needed infusion of foreign currency and market confidence. And for American farmers, it represents another season of frustration and economic pain. The unusual alignment of financial aid from Washington and soaring sales to Beijing has placed Argentina in a uniquely advantageous position. It is simultaneously receiving US dollars to stabilise its economy and Chinese yuan to boost its trade flows. For Milei, the outcome is a vindication of his gamble to suspend export taxes and leverage international tensions to Argentina's benefit. For US farmers, however, the developments highlight the vulnerability of agriculture to geopolitical conflict. Without access to China's massive demand, American producers face oversupply, declining prices and growing political pressure on the Trump administration ahead of the 2026 midterms. In the balance of the trade war, Argentina has emerged as the unlikely winner -- boosted by US money, Chinese demand and a global market reshaped by conflict between the world's two largest economies.",Firstpost,2025-10-01T09:19:22Z,https://www.firstpost.com/world/argentina-wins-us-china-trade-war-with-a-20-bn-bailout-and-soaring-soyabean-sale-13938403.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.873748,-0.003921568627450966

Agentic AI firm Zania bags $18m in NEA-led funding round,"Zania, a fast-growing agentic AI company focused on governance, risk and compliance (GRC), has closed an $18m Series A funding round to accelerate its next phase of growth. The round was led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and joined by Anthology Fund, backed by Menlo Ventures and Anthropic, Palm Drive Capital, and a syndicate of senior executives from Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal, ByteDance, Reddit, Roblox and PwC. The company develops domain-specific AI agents designed to support compliance teams as regulatory requirements become increasingly complex. Traditional GRC platforms often leave businesses reliant on large teams to perform manual tasks, but Zania's technology aims to automate these processes, compressing work that once took months into minutes. Its agents carry out risk assessments, evidence collection, controls testing and gap analyses, using capabilities such as multilingual policy ingestion and mapping against regulatory requirements. Zania plans to use the fresh capital to expand its engineering and go-to-market teams, while also accelerating development of its agentic AI platform. The system is designed to orchestrate full compliance workflows, shifting the sector from dashboards that track tasks to intelligent tools that execute them. The business has seen rapid traction since its launch, achieving tenfold ARR growth in the last six months. It has signed customers including Plaid, Grant Thornton, Stanford University and one of the Big Four accounting firms. In addition, Zania has secured partnerships with Tata Consultancy Services and HCLTech to expand the reach of its compliance solutions. Zania CEO Shruti Gupta said, ""Zania has experienced explosive growth in revenue and customers since we launched our first AI agents late last year. We're excited to continue revolutionizing the security risk, compliance, and audit space by transforming it from tools that merely organize work into true AI teammates that execute highly complex and critical tasks from start to finish."" NEA partner Mustafa Neemuchwala said, ""Cybersecurity GRC is mission-critical, yet workflows remain manual, painful, and impossible to scale. Shruti and the team at Zania bring together a rare combination of battle-tested cybersecurity, GRC, and agentic AI expertise, giving enterprises minutes-not-months speed. Their strong product-market fit is already driving rapid adoption, and we're thrilled to lead Zania's Series A."" Plaid head of security GRC Kenneth Moras said, ""Zania's AI agents have made our risk assessments dramatically faster and more efficient. By automating evidence collection and analysis, they turned a manual marathon into a sprint, freeing our team to focus on strategic risk management.""",FinTech Global,2025-10-01T09:13:53Z,https://fintech.global/2025/10/01/agentic-ai-firm-zania-bags-18m-in-nea-led-funding-round/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.874573,0.2627450980392156
India News | DGCA Launches Ranking System for Flying Training Organisations; No Institute in Top A+ or A Category | LatestLY,"New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has officially rolled out its ranking framework for Flying Training Organisations (FTOs) across India, with the first set of rankings coming into effect today. Also Read | Bihar SIR 2025: ECI Releases Final Voter List of Patna; 48,15,294 Voters Across 14 Assemblies To Cast Their Votes in State Assembly Elections 2025. According to the public notice issued by DGCA on September 30, 2025, the new ranking system aims to bring greater transparency, accountability, and performance evaluation into pilot training operations in the country. The rankings will be updated twice a year, with the next list scheduled for April 1, 2026. Speaking exclusively to ANI, DGCA DG Faiz Ahmed Kidwai said, 'This initiative was taken on the direction of Union Minister of Civil Aviation Rammohan Naidu's direction which he had directed us to set some parameters on which FTOs can be ranked and we had made those parameters, showed them to honourable minister, he had also approved and had a long discussion with all the FTOs on this and thereafter we have gone ahead and implemented this'. Also Read | UPI Transactions Free From Charges: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra Says Central Bank Has No Proposal To Impose Fees. As this is the first time we have informally had individual rankings, we have shared with the FTOs if they had any objections or suggestions, they could have got back to us, and after this exercise, only we have published this, Kidwai added. There are two purposes of this exercise. One is that the FTOs try to improve their positions and upgrade their areas where they are weak, and secondly, it is for the trainees or the pilots who seek admission or who go for training; they can also see where their FTOs are ranked, and accordingly, they can decide on where they should go for their training, Kidwai said. When asked about why no FTOs are ranked in the A or A+ category, DGCA DG said, 'Since this is the first time, maybe, and these rankings are there. I am certain there are deficiencies. Now, this is an opportunity for them to improve also. So, it will slowly catch up, and I am sure this will lead to improvements in their rankings. Under the revised framework, FTOs are categorised as follows: A+ at 85per cent and above, A between 70 and 85 per cent, B between 50 and 70 per cent, and C at below 50 per cent. Any FTO falling into Category 'C' will receive a notice from DGCA for self-analysis and corrective action to improve their performance. In the inaugural list, no FTO made it to Category A+ or A. 13 FTOs were placed in Category B, including Chimes Aviation Academy, SVKM's NMIMS Academy of Aviation, Shirpur, Bihar Flying Club, and National Flying Training Institute. A total of 22 FTOs were placed in Category C, including Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA), Redbird Flight Training Academy, Telangana State Aviation Academy, The Bombay Flying Club, and Asia Pacific Flight Training Academy Limited. The DGCA has introduced a comprehensive evaluation mechanism covering five key aspects: Performance (20 per cent) - including average time to complete 175 flying hours and aircraft utilisation. Operational Aspects (40 per cent) - covering student-to-aircraft and student-to-instructor ratios, fleet size, and simulator facilities. Safety Standards (20 per cent) - focusing on accident/incident records. Compliance Standards (10 per cent) - reviewing safety observations and alcohol test violations. Student Support (10 per cent) - including grievance redressal, scholarships, placement support, and transparent fee policies. Some FTOs, including Avyanna Aviation Academy and Vision Flying Training Institute, were excluded from this phase of ranking as they either had not completed 18 months of operations or their approvals were not valid as of August 31, 2025.

Business News | RBI Policy Opens Up the Possibility of Another Rate Cut of 25bps: BoB | LatestLY,"Get latest articles and stories on Business at LatestLY. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governors' monetary policy statement made on Wednesday has opened up the possibility of another 25 basis points (bps) rate cut, even as the central bank decided to maintain the status quo on key rates and retain a neutral stance, noted a report by Bank of Baroda. New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governors' monetary policy statement made on Wednesday has opened up the possibility of another 25 basis points (bps) rate cut, even as the central bank decided to maintain the status quo on key rates and retain a neutral stance, noted a report by Bank of Baroda. According to the policy statement, the current macroeconomic conditions and outlook have created space for further policy easing to support growth. Also Read | Bihar SIR 2025: ECI Releases Final Voter List of Patna; 48,15,294 Voters Across 14 Assemblies To Cast Their Votes in State Assembly Elections 2025. Economists at Bank of Baroda expect the terminal repo rate at 5.25 per cent, with the timing of the next rate cut likely to depend on evolving growth and inflation trends. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously voted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent, assessing the combined impact of recent tariff changes and GST rationalisation on growth. Also Read | UPI Transactions Free From Charges: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra Says Central Bank Has No Proposal To Impose Fees. The stance of the policy was retained as neutral, though two members favoured a shift towards an accommodative tone. The RBI revised its growth projection for FY26 upwards to 6.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent estimated in August policy statement, reflecting a stronger first half even as the second half is expected to moderate. For Q2 FY26, GDP growth has been marked up by 30 bps, while projections for Q3 and Q4 have been trimmed slightly. At the same time, the central bank has significantly revised down its inflation projections to 2.6 per cent for FY26 from 3.1 per cent announced in August, citing moderation in food inflation, a healthy kharif output, and comfortable reservoir levels. Inflation for Q3FY26 is now seen at 1.8 per cent, compared with the previous estimate of 3.1 per cent. RBI Governor noted that domestic fundamentals continue to remain robust, but external headwinds could pose downside risks to growth. The recent GST structure revision is expected to cushion some of the adverse impacts of trade-related disruptions. The banking system continues to remain well-capitalised with strong asset quality and profitability, even as bank credit growth has moderated due to increased reliance on non-bank financing channels. The policy also featured a slew of regulatory announcements aimed at improving credit flow and compliance. The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) framework will take effect from April 2027, with a glide path till March 2031, while revised Basel III norms will be implemented by April 2027, lowering risk weights on MSME and real estate exposures. Additionally, the RBI proposed a risk-based deposit insurance framework and allowed banks to lend in Indian rupee to resident borrowers in Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, a move expected to enhance rupee usage in cross-border transactions. Overall, while maintaining a cautious stance amid evolving global and domestic conditions, the central bank's dovish commentary signals room for a calibrated 25 bps rate cut in the near term to support growth, given benign inflation and comfortable liquidity conditions.

China's ride-hailing companies try to quell the smell in cars where some drivers sleep,"BEIJING -- You're on the move in China's capital. You've just booked a ride through a ride-hailing app and, in no time, it seems, a sleek new electric vehicle pulls up to whisk you away. Sometimes, though, not everything goes so well. Occasionally, once inside the car, a rank or funky odor assails your nostrils. After your ride, as you rate your driver, your app asks you: ""Was the car smelly?"" You click yes, and a broken heart emoji appears. ""Most taxi drivers whose cars smell bad actually live in their cars,"" explains 36-year-old driver, Shao Wei. ""I can understand them. They just want to save some money to help their families live a little better."" The smell of economic hardship is in part the result of millions of Chinese being thrown out of work by the coronavirus pandemic and China's slowing economy. Many have piled into the ride-hailing business and the wider gig economy. In 2018, Shao Wei, then 28, quit his financial sector job to return to his hometown in northeastern China, to get married, buy a home and settle down. But his business failed, he went into debt and his marriage ended in divorce. He returned to Beijing last year to drive a ride-hailing car. With no family to support, he's able to save half his earnings, and he's given himself 600 days to pay off his debt. Like many drivers, he has to work up to 15 hours a day just to get enough fares. He doesn't live in his car, which he rents and cleans daily to avoid odors. But he sympathizes with colleagues who are less fortunate. ""I think the drivers whose cars smell bad are heroes who bravely face life,"" he says, ""and I hope passengers will give them some understanding."" But Chinese consumers are increasingly demanding a more pleasant experience -- and that includes cleanliness -- for their money. In response to riders' complaints, China's biggest ride-hailing company, DiDi Chuxing, put a new policy in place last year. If drivers get too much negative feedback about their car's smell, DiDi may temporarily suspend them, until they're trained to keep their cars clean. Forty-seven-year-old driver Yang Guangdong has been driving a ride-hailing car for a decade. He doesn't sleep in his car, but he has received some odor complaints, which he says are often unfair and subjective. His advice to colleagues: Forget about using car air fresheners and perfumes, because they may backfire. ""For example, let's say you like the smell of apples, and your passenger likes jasmine,"" he says. ""You don't like each other's scents, in which case, he's sure to say your car stinks."" Beyond that, some critics say this system of ranking rides' rankness misses the point. ""I'm not sure this measure will solve the problem, except adding more surveillance on the workers,"" says University of Toronto associate professor Julie Yujie Chen, who researches labor and technology. ""I feel it's more for public relations, to kind of like appease the passengers,"" she says. China's gig economy is dominated by digital platforms, such as ride-hailing giant DiDi Chuxing, and food delivery firm Meituan. Their ""super-apps"" provide an array of services and functions, from retail sales to travel bookings to financial services. While these platforms increasingly use customer ratings, big data and algorithms to try to improve the services their employees provide, Chen argues, ""the most fundamental issues here are related to overworking drivers, and so I don't think this can be fixed by platforms alone."" Chen also notes that the platforms are publicly listed firms, and are often under pressure to please shareholders. And their business model, she says, involves taking a cut of transactions they facilitate, all of which result in their tendency to squeeze labor costs. China's central and local governments try to regulate the ride-hailing industry, sometimes encouraging laid-off workers to join it, at other times, stopping issuing new licenses to control the oversupply of drivers. But Chen says enforcement of the government's rules has often been inconsistent and lax. China's overall economic situation has added to ride-hailing service drivers' woes. The earnings report for DiDi Global Inc., the app's parent company, says that its number of registered car owners, who either drive themselves or lease them to other drivers, increased by more than 20% last year to nearly 19 million. But with economic growth slowing, consumers are taking fewer trips, and order volume last year shrank by 8%. That leaves many DiDi drivers not unemployed, but underemployed -- struggling to make ends meet and spending a lot of time waiting for fares. None of this deters the enterprising and gregarious driver Shao Wei. He says he's glad to have a job, and doesn't like to complain. He adds that, just as riders need to be tolerant of drivers who live in their cars, drivers need to put up with riders, many of whom climb aboard not exactly smelling like roses. ""Sometimes on the late shift, I meet riders who have just eaten, or have bad breath. And they're very willing to communicate with me,"" Shao says. But, he adds, it can make a long journey pass quickly, when driver and rider are shooting the breeze.

Non-food deflation ends as UK shop prices climb in September,"Retailers and consumers are confronting renewed inflationary pressure, after the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and NIQ reported shop price inflation of 1.4 % year on year in September -- up from 0.9 % in August. While food price inflation remains strong, the key change lies in non-food categories, where prolonged deflation appears to be ending. According to the BRC's Shop Price Monitor, non-food inflation rose to -0.1 % year on year in September, compared with -0.8 % in August. This shift suggests that prices in non-food sectors such as DIY and gardening are rising again after a sustained period of deflation. Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC, observed that ""a year and a half of non-food deflation looks set to come to an end, as inflationary pressures spread beyond food."" Although non-food prices are still marginally lower than a year ago, the reversal in trend marks a potentially significant turning point in retail pricing dynamics. That said, some back-to-school categories saw discounts, with retailers promoting laptops and other electronics ahead of the new term. Food inflation held steady in September at 4.2 %, the same rate as in August. Breaking down food categories, fresh food inflation remained at 4.1 %, while ambient food prices were up 4.2 % on the year. Dickinson noted that despite the stability, input price pressures such as rising energy and labour costs continue to squeeze margins in agriculture, particularly affecting dairy and beef sectors. Longer term, the BRC has flagged concerns that further cost pressures could push food inflation higher later in 2025. Retailers are navigating a difficult balance between absorbing rising costs and maintaining sales volume. Dickinson warned that ""households are finding shopping increasingly expensive"" as higher national insurance, wage growth and energy costs feed through to consumer prices. Adding to pressure, a new packaging tax set to take effect in October could further push costs upward. Mike Watkins, Head of Retailer and Business Insight at NIQ, said sustained inflationary pressures are likely to drive more promotions and deals in the short term, as consumers become more price sensitive. Meanwhile, consumers' confidence is under strain: in September, the BRC reported that personal financial sentiment weakened, with people rating the economy more negatively than the previous month. From a macro perspective, the escalation in shop price inflation feeds into broader policy debates. The wider Consumer Prices Index (CPI) reached 3.8 % in August, well above the Bank of England's 2 % target.",Yahoo!

Shortage of tourism workers could hit 43 million by 2035,"The global Travel & Tourism sector is poised to create millions of new jobs over the next decade, but a growing labour shortfall could hinder its expansion, according to a new report by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The ""Future of the Travel & Tourism Workforce"" report, launched at the WTTC's 25th Global Summit in Rome, warns that demographic shifts and structural changes may leave a gap of more than 43 million workers by 2035 if action is not taken. In 2024, Travel & Tourism supported a record 357 million jobs worldwide, a number expected to rise to 371 million this year. Over the next decade, the sector is projected to generate 91 million new roles, equivalent to one in every three new jobs globally. The report highlights that while Travel & Tourism will continue to expand faster than many other industries, demand for workers is set to outpace supply. Hospitality alone could face a shortfall of 8.6 million staff, while low-skilled roles requiring human interaction will remain among the most sought-after positions. Countries with the largest absolute workforce gaps include China (16.9 million), India (11 million), and the European Union (6.4 million). Japan, Greece, and Germany are expected to experience the largest relative shortages. The WTTC report outlines strategies to address the emerging workforce crisis. Recommendations include strengthening partnerships between educators and the travel industry, promoting careers in Travel & Tourism to young people, and enhancing digital and sustainable skill sets among employees. The report also emphasises the importance of leadership development, inclusive workplace cultures, and flexible work policies to retain staff and attract new talent. Gloria Guevara, WTTC Interim CEO, said the report is a ""call to action,"" highlighting the need for collaboration between governments, businesses, and educational institutions to ensure the sector can continue to provide rewarding opportunities worldwide. The report stresses that meeting future workforce needs will require coordinated international efforts. Governments are encouraged to adopt policies that reduce barriers to hiring, support training and upskilling initiatives, and encourage workforce diversity. Saudi Arabia was cited as an example, with nearly 50% of its Travel & Tourism workforce comprising women and more than 649,000 training opportunities. The WTTC's findings underline Travel & Tourism's role as a major engine of global employment, but they also signal the urgent need for planning to prevent labour shortages from limiting the sector's potential growth.",Yahoo!

""The conference is being organised keeping in mind our vision for 2047, and it will prove to be a milestone for India,"" he said. The event is already seeing positive outcomes even before it begins. According to Garg, three countries have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth Rs 2,200 crore for the import of 6 lakh metric tonnes of rice from India.

The participation of farmers in such large numbers is also being seen as a step toward connecting them directly with the export ecosystem, which can provide long-term benefits for their livelihood. Industry experts believe that the Bharat International Rice Conference will not only showcase India's rice sector globally but also open up new avenues for future trade partnerships, strengthening India's agricultural exports in the years ahead.

China holds National Day ceremony in waters off atoll claimed by Philippines,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's coast guard held a National Day flag-raising ceremony on a ship in the waters off the disputed Scarborough Shoal, vowing to ""stand guard"" over the atoll, a major flashpoint for diplomatic flare-ups and maritime clashes with the Philippines. Both countries claim the triangular feature in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, but it is effectively under Beijing's control. In September, China infuriated Manila with a plan to set up a ""national"" nature reserve there. Coast Guard officers standing in formation on the rear deck of the patrol vessel Dahao (3304) saluted as the Chinese flag was raised, a video showed in a Coast Guard posting on Wednesday on Douyin, known as TikTok outside China. ""We stand guard over these blue waters, assuring the nation of our unwavering commitment,"" the video subtitles read. CCG vessel 3304 had been previously challenged by the Philippine Coast Guard for its ""illegal presence"" at the shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island while in the Philippines it is known as the Panatag Shoal. The Philippine Coast Guard did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday. In 2012 China seized control of the shoal after a standoff with the Philippines and has since kept a deployment of coast guard and fishing trawlers there. A landmark ruling on South China Sea issues by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 went in favour of Manila but deciding sovereignty over the shoal was not within the scope of the decision. The ruling held that Beijing's blockade there violated international law as it was a traditional fishing ground for several countries, including the Philippines and Vietnam. Flare-ups near the shoal in recent years have included the use of water cannon, boat-ramming and manoeuvres by China's coast guard that the Philippines considers dangerously close, while jets have shadowed Philippine aircraft over it. Both sides accuse each other of provocation and trespassing, though none of the clashes have escalated into armed conflict. In a statement on Wednesday, the Chinese Coast Guard said it had stepped up law enforcement inspections around Scarborough Shoal since September to expel the ""illegal"" entry of vessels. The Southern Theatre Command of the People's Liberation Army, in a separate statement, said naval and air forces had also strengthened patrols around the shoal since last month to respond to ""infringement provocations"".

China to speed up zero-tariff trade pact with Kenya as Agoa ends,"Kenya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of AGOA since its enactment in May 2000, with textiles and apparel being the main exports. The Chinese government has vowed to speed up the implementation of the zero-tariff trade agreement with Kenya, even as the window closes for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a multilateral trade agreement that allowed qualifying African nations duty-free access to US markets. Speaking during a reception to celebrate the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Ambassador to Kenya, Guo Haiyan, said the two countries will work together to ensure Kenyans start benefiting as soon as possible from the deal. ""In June, President Xi Jinping announced to expand zero-tariff treatment for 100% of tariff lines for 53 African countries with which China maintains diplomatic ties, including Kenya. China will work with Kenya to ensure the zero-tariff takes effect at an early date so our people can benefit sooner from our cooperation,"" she said. The zero-tariff trade pact, once implemented, would allow all goods manufactured or produced in Kenya to be exported to China without duty. It will open the Chinese market to African goods. ""China's commitment to reforms and opening up remains unwavering, with its door open even wider. Having the world's second-largest consumer market, China offers the greatest potential for investment and consumption. Embracing China is embracing opportunities. Believing in China is believing in a better tomorrow, and investing in China is investing in the future. We welcome all of you to China to share opportunities."" In 2023, China was Kenya's largest source of imports, valued at approximately Sh459 billion. Kenya's total exports to China stood at Sh29 billion at the time. Kenya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of AGOA since its enactment in May 2000, with textiles and apparel being the main exports. In 2024, Kenya exported $470 million (Sh60.7 billion) worth of apparel to the US. Kenya Private Sector Alliance (Kepsa) was lobbying for a 16-year extension with an alternative of at least a two-year transition window to allow for a trade deal between Kenya and the US. Guo hailed President William Ruto's state visit to China, where, together with the Chinese president, they agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties. During the visit, at least 20 cooperation agreements witnessed by the two leaders were signed, and implementation work has been ongoing behind the scenes. ""In April this year, President William Ruto paid a successful state visit to China, and the two heads of state agreed to elevate our bilateral ties to a China-Kenya Community with a shared future for the new era. Witnessed the signing of 20 cooperation documents and issued a joint statement. ""They agreed to build the China-Kenya relationship into an inspiring example in developing the all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, to lead development of China-Africa relations and the forging of solidarity and cooperation among global south countries."" Speaking on behalf of the Government, Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi appreciated the positive contribution that China made to the development of African countries, including Kenya. He expressed willingness to work with China to firmly safeguard multilateralism and a fair and equitable international order in this complex and changing international situation. The Ambassador praised the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac), which she said has taken China-Kenya relations to greater levels. ""This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac),"" Guo said. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, 62 years ago, the two nations have respected and supported each other, built our cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, a hallmark of bilateral relations, she added.

Indonesia's MotoGP project leaves evicted villagers in limbo - Society - The Jakarta Post,"he land that villager Senum once called home has been swallowed by Indonesia's MotoGP circuit, part of a mega tourism project accused of forced evictions and rights abuses. The motorbike-mad country of 270 million people will welcome newly-crowned MotoGP champion Marc Marquez to Lombok island this weekend for the first race since he matched Valentino Rossi's seven titles with victory in Japan. But outside the Mandalika circuit, there is little to celebrate for dozens of Indigenous Sasak families who say they face land evictions and compensation battles linked to the venue's development. ""They forced us to leave just like dogs and chickens. They are like a thief,"" said Senum, 47, who has had to move twice since authorities arrived with heavy machinery in 2018. ""I had to run away from my land because I was scared. I don't want to die stupidly."" He says he was promised Rp10 million ($600) for land that became part of the MotoGP track, far below market price. And in the end, he only received Rp 3 million. The world's premier motorcycle race returned to Indonesia in 2022 after a 25-year hiatus, at a 4.31-kilometer track in Lombok's beach-lined Kuta resort town. The government hopes the project will diversify tourism away from popular island Bali, but it has stoked a years-long struggle between authorities and residents. Most of the 124 families in the area have been forced out or moved elsewhere. Just 44 remain, fighting for compensation, residents said. Sibawahi, a 56-year-old carpenter and farmer who goes by one name, says the project consumed the land he used for coconut trees and livestock. In 2020, authorities demanded he leave, claiming his deceased parents had sold the land, without providing evidence. He lost nearly four hectares after police and soldiers seized it in 2021. He is still awaiting compensation. ""I can't accept it. My feelings are indescribable. It's too sad for oppressed people like us,"" he said. ""What I hope is they pay me for the land."" Impoverished Lombok has struggled to rebuild after a deadly 2018 earthquake, and former president Joko Widodo -- whose government designated the area a special economic zone -- has hailed the project for employing 3,000 residents. But other residents have protested around the track and outside the governor's office, demanding the return of their land or adequate compensation. In July, fresh evictions left more than 2,000 people without their primary source of income, UN experts said. In an August report, they ""expressed alarm"" at alleged intimidation and use of force, and warned ""communities are now living in fear"". The state-owned Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), which oversees development of the Mandalika complex, and local Lombok authorities did not respond to AFP's requests for comment. But ITDC has previously told local media that the land it manages is ""clean and clear"", and that it ""respects the rights of the community"". Some residents say they cannot even benefit from the track as they are prevented from selling to visitors, and are even stopped from leaving their new homes on race weekend without permission. ""We're like a cow tied up in a cage,"" said Senum. Housewife Suman was paid Rp 15 million to leave her rented home near what is now a bend of the MotoGP track, and said she is happy to have moved. ""When they started (building)... it was crowded,"" she told AFP. ""I am grateful to stay here now."" But others like Senum are holding out for better compensation. ""Pay us properly and give us our dignity,"" he said, as an excavator scraped away at his former land. ""If they want to keep building... fix our problem first.""",The Jakarta Post,2025-10-01T09:16:01Z,https://www.thejakartapost.com/indonesia/2025/10/01/indonesias-motogp-project-leaves-evicted-villagers-in-limbo.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.879634,0.07450980392156858
Pop Mart looks to turn Labubu's viral fame into Disney-style theme park empire,"Pop Mart, the Chinese maker of the viral Labubu doll, is seeking to transform the breakout character into an entertainment franchise, taking lessons from Disney's success with iconic intellectual properties. In an interview with Reuters news agency, executive director Si De said the company intended to leverage Labubu beyond toy sales, with plans for animation, theme parks, content collaborations, and merchandise expansion. ""We have learned from Disney for a long time. In fact, Disney's great value lies in its ability to operate intellectual property over the long term, even up to 100 years,"" he said, referring to the American company's Mickey Mouse character. Pop Mart aims to replicate this approach, gradually building a portfolio of five to 10 original IPs with long-term potential. The company, Mr Si declared, wasn't chasing the ""next big hit"", but concentrating on enhancing existing products and exploring new avenues for Labubu. Labubu's global appeal has already had a significant financial impact, triggering a nearly 200 per cent jump in Pop Mart's shares this year and briefly making the company more valuable than Hasbro, Mattel, and Sanrio combined. The Labubu plush dolls, designed in 2015 by Hong Kong-born illustrator Kasing Lung as part of his playful character series, The Monsters, generated nearly 35 per cent of Pop Mart's first-half revenues in 2025. The success of Labubu also boosted sales of other Pop Mart characters like Skullpanda, Molly and Crybaby, each surpassing 1bn yuan in first-half sales. It was previously reported that Pop Mart was exploring further global expansion, particularly into the emerging markets of Latin America and the Middle East. The Chinese company already operates stores worldwide, including in the US and Europe. Such is the popularity of Labubu that counterfeits are flooding overseas markets. South Korean authorities, for example, seized about 7,000 suspected counterfeit Labubu items, including dolls, key chains, figures, and phone cases, in June and July this year. The UK too seized thousands of counterfeit Labubu dolls recently. The fake versions, sold by third party retailers, featured loose stitching and detachable parts that posed choking hazards for children, authorities said. The imitations came without the required safety markings, importer information and legal safety warnings, violating the UK's Toys Safety Regulations 2011.",Yahoo,2025-10-01T09:12:04Z,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/pop-mart-looks-turn-labubu-091204406.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.880164,0.4509803921568627
Sri Trang Gloves Showcases Thai Excellence to Diplomats,"Ambassadors from 21 countries visit STGT's Songkhla facilities, reinforcing confidence in Thailand's rubber glove industry and southern economic potential. Sri Trang Gloves (Thailand) Public Company Limited (STGT) welcomed ambassadors and diplomatic representatives from 21 countries on an official visit to its Anvar Branch factory in Songkhla and Sri Trang Group's rubber plantations, underscoring the strength of Thailand's rubber glove industry and the promise of the southern border provinces.

US Dollar Remains Under Pressure as Government Shutdown Hits Risk Sentiment | Investing.com,"Gold rally continues; oil stabilizes after reports of 500k bpd increase are dismissed Following a fruitless meeting between US President Trump and the four Congressional leaders, the US federal government is now officially shut. Notably, there have been 15 shutdowns since 1981, and only three lasted more than five days. Crucially though, the longest closure occurred in 2018 when Trump was in the White House. While critical agencies will remain in operation, the Bureau of Labour Statistics and the US Census Bureau are expected to suspend their data releases until further notice. This means that, barring a quick agreement between Democrats and Trump, Thursday's and Friday's jobs data will not be published. Coupled with the light Fedspeak calendar, markets will be forced to make do with private data releases. Today, the ADP employment report and the ISM manufacturing PMI survey will be published, helping shape market expectations for the late-October Fed rate meeting. The ADP report is forecast to show a 50k increase, following a 54k gain in August. The six-month rolling average has dropped to 62.2k, the lowest pace since early 2022, excluding the COVID impact. Despite the low ADP-NFP correlation, a solid print today could go a long way towards making investors more optimistic about the current strength of the labour market. Later today, the ISM manufacturing PMI survey is expected to show a marginal improvement to 49, with the headline index staying below 50 for the seventh consecutive month. Given the market's sensitivity to labour market indicators, it would be interesting to see whether the employment subindex remains stuck at its lowest levels since mid-2020. The US shutdown comes at the start of the final quarter of 2025, which is expected to be equally volatile as the rest of the year. Amidst these market conditions, the US dollar remains under pressure, with euro/dollar trading at 1.1760 at the time of writing. This latest upward move could also be attributed to yesterday's strong German CPI report, raising the possibility of a sizeable upside surprise at today's eurozone preliminary CPI report. More noticeably, dollar/yen continues to decline, quickly returning to the midpoint of its recent range trading, and testing the support set by the busy 146.46-147.78 zone. The newsflow from the Japanese side has not been sufficiently positive to justify this move, particularly as the country is gearing for Saturday's LDP leadership contest, and today's soft quarterly Tankan survey. Notably, despite some recovery against specific peers in September, the dollar remains strongly on the back foot in 2025. It is currently down 14% against the euro, with dollar/Swiss franc in the second spot with a 12% decline. Dollar/yen is just 6% lower this year. While major investment houses speculate on the duration of the shutdown, equities are still digesting the current newsflow. That mood could quickly turn sour if the shutdown continues into next week, especially if US President Trump does not appear ready to compromise. September was a positive month, mostly for US and Asian equities. That said, the German DAX 40 continues to outperform its US counterparts, including the mighty Nasdaq 100 index. But their returns are dwarfed by the 47% increase recorded by gold, which is outperforming even stablecoins. After posting a new all-time high, gold is hovering north of $3,860, ready to take advantage of any weakness in the dollar and/or a deterioration in risk appetite. Meanwhile, the newsflow from both the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts remains negative, which, despite the week-long absence of China due to its Golden Week, might be sufficient to keep gold bid. Finally, speculation regarding the October 5 OPEC+ online meeting is rife, with oil prices stabilizing above $62.50 after reports of a 500k bpd increase were dismissed by the OPEC Secretariat. That said, a production increase is expected on Sunday, but it is unlikely to diverge much from the September decision of a 137k bpd rise.",Investing.com,2025-10-01T09:19:44Z,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-dollar-remains-under-pressure-as-government-shutdown-hits-risk-sentiment-200667794,2025-10-01 17:26:54.880921,0.1058823529411765
CMA calls for new UK block exemption to replace current TTBER,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has issued a final recommendation to overhaul the UK's approach to technology transfer agreements. The regulator is urging the government to replace the current Assimilated Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (TTBER) with a new UK block exemption order when the existing framework expires on 30 April 2026. According to the CMA, the recommendation signals a move away from legacy EU-based rules on technology licensing, aligning post-Brexit competition regulation with domestic requirements. The TTBER, retained following the UK's departure from the European Union, sets out conditions under which companies can license and share technology. This includes patents and software, without falling foul of competition law. The CMA's proposal outlines a 12-year exemption order tailored for the UK landscape. It includes provisions that seek to offer legal certainty for technology transfer agreements while incorporating updated definitions and requirements relevant to current industry practices. Industry stakeholders including Nokia, Sisvel International, and Avanci contributed feedback during the CMA's consultation process. No respondents suggested letting the TTBER lapse without a replacement. Six respondents explicitly warned that allowing the regulation to expire without substitution would have negative consequences for technology licensing and innovation in the UK market. Respondents generally agreed that the TTBER had functioned effectively and generated benefits for technology transfer arrangements. The CMA has recommended specific changes for the proposed UK exemption order. These include removing outdated references to ""utility models"" and expanding coverage to incorporate database copyrights and database rights. The changes also involve formally defining concepts such as active sales and passive sales. The regulator also seeks to update the qualifying criteria for exemption. Agreements would be eligible if they meet established market share thresholds. They could also qualify if there are at least three independently controlled, substitutable technologies in addition to those held by the parties to the agreement. In its final recommendation to the government, the CMA stated that technology transfer agreements may encourage innovation, investment and growth, but certain provisions within these agreements can also adversely impact competition. The authority aims to create a regulatory environment that supports both technological collaboration and safeguards against potential anti-competitive conduct.",Yahoo!

No Proposal To Levy Charges On UPI Transactions: RBI Guv,"Mumbai- Reserve Bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday said there is no proposal to levy any charge on UPI transactions. The governor also said the central bank is examining a proposal to allow lenders to remotely lock mobile phones bought on credit in case of default in EMI payments. While responding to a question whether there is a proposal to levy charges on UPI transactions, which have gone up significantly, Malhotra said there was no proposal. ""Is there going to be charges on UPI? Well, there is no proposal before us,"" he said at a post-monetary policy press conference. On digital locking of phones bought on credit, the governor said the matter was under consideration. RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao added that both pros and cons regarding the digital locking of phones are being examined. ""The issue of digital locking is under examination as the Governor has pointed out. There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and creditors' requirements. So, we are examining the issue, we will...take a view at a later point in time,"" Rao said. During the press conference, Malhotra and other deputy governors replied to a host of queries, including on rate cut possibilities in forthcoming polices, and rupee depreciation. On the rate cut, the governor said inflation has dropped considerably, providing space for monetary easing. On the depreciating value of the rupee against the US dollar, he said the central bank does not target any level or band, but only tries to check undue volatility. Malhotra also exuded confidence that the very high GDP growth trajectory will continue with price stability, and private capital expenditure will pick up. He said the RBI raised the GDP growth projection to 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent because of good economic activities in the first half of 2025-26.",Kashmir Observer,2025-10-01T09:17:49Z,https://kashmirobserver.net/2025/10/01/no-proposal-to-levy-charges-on-upi-transactions-rbi-guv/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.882179,-0.01960784313725494

""This is particularly important under the current global environment of heightened uncertainties and geopolitical tensions,"" he said. Yeah also noted that Malaysia's participation in multiple trade blocs, namely the CPTPP, the RCEP, and the upcoming Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) -- a comprehensive agreement among ASEAN member countries -- would give it a competitive edge to serve as a regional hub. ""Malaysia is well-positioned to transform itself into a major regional production and trading hub, and also act as a bridge to foster trade among members with less connected markets,"" he said. Meanwhile, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd's chief economist, Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, said the CPTPP could act as a ""catalyst"" for Malaysian businesses, especially MSMEs, to scale up, but only if real investment is made in capacity building. ""MSMEs make up 96 per cent of businesses in the country. That means that financial literacy, digital savviness, and business planning must become core skills.

Serica to buy 100% of issued share capital of Prax Upstream,"UK-based oil and gas company Serica Energy has entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the issued share capital of Prax Upstream from Prax Exploration & Production. Prax Upstream is the operator and sole owner of the Lancaster field and is party to separate executed sale and purchase agreements (SPAs) with TotalEnergies and ONE-Dyas for the acquisition of some assets. Combined with completion of the existing SPAs with TotalEnergies and ONE-Dyas, the latest transaction provides Serica with a 40% operated interest in the Greater Laggan Area (GLA), a 10% interest in the Catcher field, a 5.21% interest in the Golden Eagle Area Development and a 100% interest in the Lancaster field. The aggregate upfront consideration for the acquisitions is $25.6m (£19.02m). The corporate acquisition of Prax Upstream is for a consideration of $18.9m. Serica CEO Chris Cox said: ""The addition of GLA brings Serica a new production hub, with operatorship of the Shetland Gas Plant. ""There is an immediate boost to production and reserves, plus the scope to create significant value for shareholders through multiple subsurface, commercial and further M&A [mergers and acquisitions] opportunities."" Completion of the purchase is expected in Q4 of this year (Q4 2025), with completion of the existing SPAs anticipated in Q1 2026. Serica says that, in total, the transactions bring an additional 11 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) of proved and probable (2P) reserves, implying an acquisition price of $2.3 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). The combined portfolio will broaden Serica's production mix. Production for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025) associated with the existing SPAs is reported at 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while Lancaster is reported at 5,900boepd. The Lancaster field production is expected to cease in H2 2026. The acquisition will provide Serica with a new operated hub in the West of Shetland basin, offering numerous opportunities for organic growth. These include an infill well on the Tormore field, development of the Glendronach field, four exploration licences and third-party throughput possibilities at the Shetland Gas Plant. Once the transactions are completed, Serica will make an upfront payment totalling $25.6m. Additionally, the company will receive payments amounting to an estimated $100m. These payments account for interim post-tax cash flows between the economic dates of each transaction and the anticipated completion dates. Besides the completion payments, Serica expects an incremental free cash flow of around $50m from the acquired assets next year.",Yahoo!

Pop Mart looks to turn Labubu's viral fame into theme park empire,"Pop Mart, the Chinese maker of the viral Labubu doll, is seeking to transform the breakout character into an entertainment franchise, taking lessons from Disney's success with iconic intellectual properties. In an interview with Reuters news agency, executive director Si De said the company intended to leverage Labubu beyond toy sales, with plans for animation, theme parks, content collaborations, and merchandise expansion. ""We have learned from Disney for a long time. In fact, Disney's great value lies in its ability to operate intellectual property over the long term, even up to 100 years,"" he said, referring to the American company's Mickey Mouse character. Pop Mart aims to replicate this approach, gradually building a portfolio of five to 10 original IPs with long-term potential. The company, Mr Si declared, wasn't chasing the ""next big hit"", but concentrating on enhancing existing products and exploring new avenues for Labubu. Labubu's global appeal has already had a significant financial impact, triggering a nearly 200 per cent jump in Pop Mart's shares this year and briefly making the company more valuable than Hasbro, Mattel, and Sanrio combined. The Labubu plush dolls, designed in 2015 by Hong Kong-born illustrator Kasing Lung as part of his playful character series, The Monsters, generated nearly 35 per cent of Pop Mart's first-half revenues in 2025. The success of Labubu also boosted sales of other Pop Mart characters like Skullpanda, Molly and Crybaby, each surpassing 1bn yuan in first-half sales. It was previously reported that Pop Mart was exploring further global expansion, particularly into the emerging markets of Latin America and the Middle East. The Chinese company already operates stores worldwide, including in the US and Europe. Such is the popularity of Labubu that counterfeits are flooding overseas markets. South Korean authorities, for example, seized about 7,000 suspected counterfeit Labubu items, including dolls, key chains, figures, and phone cases, in June and July this year. The UK too seized thousands of counterfeit Labubu dolls recently. The fake versions, sold by third party retailers, featured loose stitching and detachable parts that posed choking hazards for children, authorities said. The imitations came without the required safety markings, importer information and legal safety warnings, violating the UK's Toys Safety Regulations 2011.",The Independent,2025-10-01T09:12:04Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/labubu-theme-park-china-pop-mart-b2837066.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.884387,0.4509803921568627
FX Daily: Shutdown And Slowdown Weigh On The Dollar,"The dollar has turned a little softer today after the US Congress failed to reach a deal to avoid a government shutdown. Investors are fearful that this could be a longer shutdown, which will only weigh further on consumer confidence and job security. We continue to favour some modest further gains for the yen and the euro. As Francesco Pesole discussed yesterday, it has indeed been the more defensive yen which has benefited the most from the US government shutdown, which went into effect overnight. The moves in FX markets have been modest so far, but investors will be wary that this could be one of the longer shutdowns seen over the last 30 years. Shutdowns have typically lasted anywhere from three to 35 days. Presumably, Democrats are going into this shutdown eyes wide open, wanting to be known as the party that fought for healthcare when it comes to mid-term elections next November. And with Republicans controlling the congressional agenda and President Trump fully utilising his executive authority, the need for a 60-seat Senate approval for government funding is probably the only area in which the Democrats can flex their muscle. Prior performance is no guarantee of future returns, but previous shutdowns have typically seen bullish steepening of the US yield curve, a slightly softer dollar and mixed news for equities. Currently, S&P futures are called 0.5% lower. What is probably more relevant for FX markets is the context of this shutdown. James Knightley put it nicely yesterday, when discussing the slowdown in US consumer confidence and the swing in sentiment towards jobs being harder to get. A government shutdown will feed into those trends - especially if President Trump follows through with threats to fire and not just furlough non-essential government staff. Remember that as many as 150k government staff lay-offs may hit the October non-farm payroll result as part of DOGE's austerity drive earlier this year. The shutdown also means we are unlikely to see weekly jobless claims on Thursday and the September payroll report on Friday. For today, it still looks like we will receive the September ADP employment report and the ISM manufacturing report. Consensus on the former is around +50k, and the dollar could be vulnerable to a downside miss. The ISM index is still expected to be sub-50 today, and the prices paid component will be closely watched. However, our team's core view remains that tariff-related goods price inflation will be softer than initially feared and that the softening in the labour market and rental trends means that services inflation is heading lower. That should allow the Fed to cut in October and December. DXY could drift towards the 97.20 area and USD/JPY to 147.00/147.20 - with softer US equities probably a dollar negative in the current environment. A speech by ECB President Christine Lagarde was read as mildly dovish yesterday, in that the ECB being in a 'good place' did not prevent it from adjusting interest rates. As Carsten Brzeski discusses here, recent German activity data have come in on the soft side and the market has not completely ruled out one further ECB cut. With that in mind, we doubt the market will want to drive EUR/USD too much higher on what should be a rise in September eurozone inflation to 2.2% year-on-year today, while core is expected to remain at 2.3%. However, we think the US government shutdown and the softer dollar story should dominate today and could be enough to drag EUR/USD to 1.1800/1820. It's been quite a busy week for Swiss news. On Monday, the Swiss National Bank effectively increased the amount of CHF banking deposits exposed to a 0.25bp charge. The press release pitched that as a technical clean-up to last year's adjustment in minimum reserves. We would not describe this as a 'stealth' easing of monetary policy, but we will watch what happens to Swiss money market rates when the measure goes into effect on 1 November. It is a downside risk to the franc, however. Late Monday also brought a very rare joint statement from Swiss and US authorities on the use of FX intervention. The SNB statement marketed this as a kind of blessing to use FX intervention as part of its regular monetary policy activities. Whereas the US version of the statement merely focused on the use of intervention to address disorderly or volatile markets. That may be the reason why EUR/CHF has not traded much higher on the news. And these releases preceded data which showed SNB FX buying intervention had picked up a little to CHF5bn in the second quarter. We speculate whether the FX intervention statement has something to do with the pharma deals President Trump is announcing this week. Presumably, Washington wants to get the Swiss drugmakers onside as he launches his new 'TrumpRx' website to deliver drugs at discounted rates to US consumers. Pfizer was the first of the big companies to sign up to this yesterday. If this read is right, then, yes, maybe Switzerland does have Washington's blessing for continued FX intervention and can avoid being labelled a currency manipulator. SNB FX intervention will be passive, however, and we forecast EUR/CHF to continue to trade near 0.92/93 into year-end. Yesterday's inflation figures in Poland brought a small surprise, with September inflation unchanged at 2.9% YoY. However, food prices were the main reason for the slower growth. This leads our economists to believe that the National Bank of Poland will leave rates unchanged in October and wait for November and the new forecast. However, it took inflation that was one-tenth weaker than expected and below the 3% threshold as a signal that the National Bank of Poland has a clear path for a rate cut as early as next week's October meeting. Still, a rate cut in October does not necessarily mean further rate cuts in November or December, but the market remains on the dovish side of pricing. Given that we are not far from pricing in two full rate cuts for this year, the market may see a hawkish surprise if anything. At the same time, EUR/PLN remains at the top of its current range of 4.240-275. Although conviction about the NBP's next steps is not high, we tend to believe that the PLN may see some rebound due to the Polish central bank and the grinding up of EUR/USD. Today in the CEE region, we will see PMIs across the board, which could show some slight improvement in sentiment, with attention recently focused on the widening gap between the lowest levels in Poland and surprisingly good figures in the Czech Republic. Speaking of the Czech Republic, today we will see the September budget figures as well.",TalkMarkets,2025-10-01T09:19:24Z,https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/fx-daily-shutdown-and-slowdown-weigh-on-the-dollar?post=525824,2025-10-01 17:26:54.885182,0.07450980392156858
Sabrina Carpenter buys plush penthouse in Tribeca for $10.5 million,"The penthouse boasts an expansive living area with a fireplace and glass doors that open up to one of many terraces. Sabrina Carpenter at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 7, 2025 in Elmont, New York. Sabrina Carpenter may be ready to give fans a real-life ""House Tour"" after reportedly purchasing a picturesque $10.5 million penthouse inside a celebrity-loved New York City building. The Tribeca duplex was put on the market by beauty mogul Cassandra Grey in December with an asking price of $11.5 million-although that sum was lowered to $10.5 million just two months later. And it seems that the 26-year-old ""Espresso"" hitmaker managed to snag an even better bargain, with The Real Deal reporting that she paid ""nearly $10 million,"" while loan documents seen by the outlet indicate that Carpenter took out a $6.5 million mortgage on the property. Grey, who founded the luxury beauty retailer Violet Grey, took a hit on the sale of the posh pad, having purchased it for $10.8 million in 2022, according to property records. According to its description, the plush penthouse-which was listed by Frances Katzen of Douglas Elliman-sprawls across 2,900 square feet and boasts three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and four private terraces. The dwelling boasts an expansive living area with a cozy fireplace and glass doors that open up to one of the many terraces. Adjacent to the living room is the dining area, which comes complete with its own set of sliding glass doors that lead outside and enough space for a large dining table. The private terrace features a large wraparound couch, a coffee table, and sweeping views of Manhattan's skyline. The other terraces boast a small coffee table and chairs. Moving into the chef's kitchen, there is a large marble island with a matching marble backsplash and white cabinets. The primary bedroom features its own fireplace, enough room for a king-sized bed, and space for a seating area. There are two walk-in closets for the singer to get her glam on. It also boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and access to a private terrace with another couch. The main bathroom is the epitome of elegance, offering a soaking tub, dual vanities, and a glass shower with a marble backsplash. The other bedrooms are slightly smaller; however, they still feature access to one of the many terraces. The unit comes with a private storage unit, and Carpenter can purchase private parking. The building, which was previously the headquarters of New York Life Insurance Co., was transformed into condos in 2018 by the Elad Group. It comes complete with a fitness center and lavish lounge. Carpenter's neighbors now include Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman, who purchased a $3.5 million pad in the building in 2020, and Alexandra Clancy, who snapped up one of the penthouses for $21.4 million earlier this year. More from Realtor.com: I'm 37, Make $125K, and Bought an Aladdin Kit House in Maine for Just $11K Down Interestingly, Carpenter's purchase of the property-which is currently listed as ""pending"" sale on Realtor.com-comes just weeks before she is due to take her ""Short n' Sweet"" tour to the Big Apple, where she will play five shows at Madison Square Garden, beginning on Oct. 26. It's unclear whether the singer will be able to move into the home before her tour rolls into town. However, it will undoubtedly provide the perfect sanctuary for Carpenter to escape to whenever she is in Manhattan. It marks the latest property acquisition for Carpenter-who made her first foray into the real estate market at the tender age of 21.

She made her first big purchase in the real estate world just months after she wrapped up ""Girl Meets World,"" picking up a $1.7 million property in the Los Angeles suburb of Northridge in 2018. Although Carpenter has owned it for a few years, there are not many details known about it.

A trillion-ton threat hangs over critical minerals,"Mining generates a trillion tons of waste, posing a major obstacle to securing critical minerals. This dross, including unstable tailings, causes collapses and toxic contamination, as seen in recent disasters like Grasberg and Zambia. Climate change intensifies these risks, threatening communities and future mineral supply as ore grades decline. You might think the business of mining is digging up valuable minerals. In fact, it's almost the opposite. Most of the rock that miners blast, shovel and truck out of the ground is useless waste -- first the overburden of worthless material that has to be dug away to get to the ore body, then the tailings left over when the ore has been ground up and processed to extract its useful elements. To produce a teaspoonful of gold these days, you often need to remove an Eiffel Tower's-worth of material from the earth. Managing that growing mountain of dross -- likely more than a trillion metric tons at present, and forecast to double by 2050 -- is one of the biggest obstacles to getting our hands on the critical minerals the world will need over the coming decades. The collapse of mine walls and waste heaps can bury or trap workers, send toxic minerals into waterways, and block access to precious deposits. A warming planet is bringing heavier downpours, along with more volatile cycles of dry and wet spells, further destabilizing the fragile equilibrium that holds such piles of rock together. The world's second-biggest copper mine saw a brutal illustration of this reality recently. At Grasberg, a vast pit atop a mountain in the Indonesian half of New Guinea island, 800,000 tons of mud and rock swept through underground tunnels on Sept. 8, killing two people and leaving five missing. Activity at the mine, which produced about 3.5% of the world's copper and 1.8% of its gold last year, has been halted and won't be back to normal until 2027, operator Freeport McMoRan Inc. said last week. It's still far too early to understand the exact causes of this disaster, but one culprit is clear: water. Grasberg is one of the wettest spots on the planet, with one access road near the mine sometimes receiving more than 12 meters of rainfall a year. Though the underground cavern where the flow of wet material happened is well below the bottom of the 550-meter-deep open pit, rain inevitably permeates far below the surface. Once there, it can force open microscopic cracks, fracturing the rock. The process is only accentuated by the often freezing temperatures of the Papuan highlands. Miners aren't ignorant of this process. Because it's such a high-risk activity, vast ingenuity and expense is spent on understanding and monitoring the slopes that hold waste rock and mine walls in place. Looked at one way, the 45 failures of tailings dams during the 2010s -- the largest number of such accidents in any decade since the 1970s -- are testament to the inadequacy of our safety systems. When you consider the vastly greater volumes of material getting discarded now, however, it's a miracle the figure isn't any worse. The problem is likely worst around the roughly 35,000 different sites where these tailings are stacked. Such waste is particularly troublesome because it's already been through processing plants, which increase the concentrations of toxic elements and grind particles into a fine silt that's about as stable as mud. When mineral deposits are exhausted, no one wants to take over the multi-decade liability of managing these piles. Responsibility is often lumped with governments, who will occasionally contract new companies to squeeze a few extra drops of precious minerals from the waste. In Zambia, the US embassy ordered the evacuation of staff from the copper-mining city of Kitwe last month after a tailings dam being reprocessed by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia Ltd., a state-owned Chinese company, collapsed in February. The embassy described the disaster as the sixth-worst such accident in history, contaminating downstream communities with arsenic, cyanide and uranium. The company and the Zambian government say these assessments are an exaggeration. What's clear is that we're not prepared for how much worse this situation could get. The grades of key ore deposits have been declining in recent years -- by as much as 40% since 1991 in the case of copper, according to BHP Group Ltd. -- while the amount of overburden that needs to be removed to get to them is rising. That means that the amount of material we're digging up is rising faster than the amount of useful minerals we're extracting, with a record 28.74 billion tons removed in 2023, according to S&P Global. Many of these minerals, such as copper, lithium, and rare earths, are expected to be critical for a world transitioning to clean energy. Geopolitical rivals trying to localize their supply chains are likely to increase demand even further. More stringent monitoring is going to raise costs, which are already high enough to constrain supply below levels the world needs. The rules under which these waste dumps are managed will often be based on historical climate records, rather than ones that reflect the increasingly unstable conditions the world is moving into. The engineers who failed to account for how warmer air could overwhelm stormwater systems and inundate cities once thought safe are facing the same problems managing the trembling berms where a trillion tons of rock are stacked. If you live downstream of a mine, the coming decades are going to be risky ones.",Economic Times,2025-10-01T09:19:20Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/a-trillion-ton-threat-hangs-over-critical-minerals/articleshow/124253611.cms,2025-10-01 17:26:54.886887,-0.3254901960784313
From When You'll be Able to Withdraw EPFO Money From ATM? Finally Big Update Come - Times Bull,"EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organization) is in the process to make it's members life more easy. In the past, the EPFO members had to struggle a bit to withdraw their money. Now, the organization is planing to make the withdrawal process easy. According to various media reports, the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), the EPFO's highest decision-making body, is likely to approve ATM withdrawals at its next board meeting, scheduled for the second week of October. A CBDT member told the media, ""We have learned that the EPFO's IT infrastructure is ready for such transactions."" He added, ""There will be a limit on ATM withdrawals, but this is yet to be discussed."" As of today, the EPFO's total corpus is over ₹28 lakh crore and its total membership is approximately 78 million. The government wants members to have easy access to their accumulated corpus. To this end, the ministry has also engaged with banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It is likely that the EPFO will issue special cards to its members to enable them to make ATM withdrawals. It is worth noting that earlier this year, the EPFO increased the automatic claim settlement limit from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This process determines claim eligibility through digital checks and algorithms, eliminating the need for manual verification. Experts say that ATM withdrawals will provide EPFO members with quick access to funds in case of an emergency. However, the success of this facility will depend on the organization's digital capabilities, security measures, and coordination with banks and payment networks.",Times Bull,2025-10-01T09:14:52Z,https://www.timesbull.com/business/from-when-youll-be-able-to-withdraw-epfo-money-from-atm-finally-big-update-come-616199.html,2025-10-01 17:26:54.887087,0.2313725490196079
Co-payment stimulus scheme to start on Oct 29,"Registration to open soon for Khon La Khrueng programme, billed as a 'quick big win' The government's Khon La Khrueng (half-half) co-payment economic stimulus scheme will begin on Oct 29, with registration expected to open soon after cabinet approval next week, according to Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas. Mr Ekniti, also deputy prime minister, said registration would use the same system, based on the Pao Tang app, that consumers are familiar with from 2020-22 when the programme was first introduced to stimulate the pandemic-hit economy. The programme will last for two months, with the daily co-payment limit increased to 200 baht from 150 baht previously, aimed at delivering a ""quick big win"" to stimulate spending and the economy. The increase is part of a dual-pronged ""Plus"" enhancement -- a higher subsidy and broader inclusion, said the minister. ""Quick"" refers to the speed of implementation -- with the project ready for immediate rollout following cabinet approval. ""Big"" represents an increase in the co-payment share, said Mr Ekniti. ""Win"" means this round will be expanded to include small legal entities in addition to individual vendors, in response to public feedback and a desire to distribute benefits more broadly among small business operators and taxpayers. ""Plus"" means that people who pay tax will qualify for an additional 2,400 baht in co-payment benefits, reflecting the government's intent to reward those who participate in the tax system. ""Plus"" also represents the focus on digital skill development, said the minister. Participating vendors will be encouraged to adopt digital tools, use e-commerce platforms, and basic accounting systems to enhance financial literacy and competitiveness among Thai small businesses. During the debate on the government's policy statement on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dismissed criticism that the scheme is a thinly veiled attempt at pre-election campaigning. Khon La Khrueng proved popular and effective during the pandemic, as it subsidised purchases of selected daily-use goods, easing household burdens while injecting cash directly into the economy. The scheme had a total budget of 208 billion baht from 2020-22. Thais 18 and older who did not hold state welfare cards were eligible, with about 30 million participants in total. The budget for the 2025 version of the programme has not been confirmed but it is expected to be around 50 billion baht.",Bangkok Post,2025-10-01T09:19:07Z,https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3113997/copayment-stimulus-scheme-to-start-on-oct-29,2025-10-01 17:26:54.887361,0.5294117647058822

"TNC, Nucor to boost US nuclear supply chain - Nuclear Engineering International","The Nuclear Company (TNC), which is committed to fleet-scale nuclear power in the US has signed a strategic agreement with steelmaker Nucor. The agreement aims to promote revitalisation of the US nuclear supply chain and grow American manufacturing. TNC and Nucor will evaluate the promotion of steel materials and related manufacturing that meet the stringent American Society of Mechanical Engineers NQA-1 certification standard. The review process will also consider factors including energy infrastructure and the available workforce, to promote reinvestment in the US industrial asset base. The partnership follows President Donald Trump's series of Executive Orders calling for 400 GWe of nuclear reactors by 2050 to provide the baseload power required to lead the world in AI. The orders call for 10 large-scale reactors to be under construction by 2030, as well as strong investments in the American nuclear supply chain for materials, components and fuel. ""Nucor is dedicated to rebuilding American energy infrastructure to make it more resilient,"" said Nucor Chair, President & CEO Leon Topalian. ""Our work with The Nuclear Company will help us continue our long-term initiatives to repower the domestic energy sector, as well as reshore manufacturing to lessen American dependence on unreliable foreign global supply chains."" According to a 2022 Department of Energy (DOE) report, the American nuclear supply chain lacks large forges for the production of gigawatt-scale reactor pressure vessels, with current production concentrated in Asia. A study by the World Nuclear Association found that the number of American facilities certified to produce commercial nuclear-grade components has decreased by more than 40% over the past three decades. During that time, the US built just two nuclear reactors while China has built 37 reactors in the past decade. ""America is at a critical point for power,"" said TNC Co-Founder & CEO Jonathan Webb. ""China is on the verge of becoming the world's largest nuclear power producer, surpassing the United States, just as it did decades ago with manufacturing. Our partnership with Nucor will protect America's national security, help achieve energy independence and create a more resilient economy."" TNC, which emerged from stealth mode in 2024 and completed its Series A funding round in April, is evaluating sites to support a 6 GWe fleet of reactors. In July, TNC announced a major deal with military and surveillance company Palantir to build a software platform equipped with artificial intelligence to transform the construction of nuclear reactors into a predictable process, with the aim of enabling TNC to build plants faster and safer for less.",Nuclear Engineering International,2025-10-01T09:19:00Z,https://www.neimagazine.com/news/tnc-nucor-to-boost-us-nuclear-supply-chain/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.888676,0.4509803921568627

"Ethereum Outlook: ETH Bulls Not Safe Yet, Upsides Still Face Barriers","Ethereum (ETH) started a fresh decline below $4,250. The price is now recovering some losses but faces a key hurdle near $4,400. In the last technical analysis, we saw a fresh decline in Ethereum below $4,500. The bears remained in action and pushed the price below $4,250. Finally, the price spiked below $4,000 and tested the $3,820 support region. A low was formed at $3,832 and the price is now recovering some losses, like Bitcoin. There was a move above the $4,000 and $4,050 levels. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,761 swing high to the $3,832 low, but the price still faces a lot of hurdles. Ethereum is still well below the $4,250 mark and the 50-day simple moving average. The current price action suggests that the price could struggle to continue higher. On the upside, immediate resistance sits near the $4,200 level. The first major hurdle sits near the $4,250 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $4,280 on the daily chart. A close above the trend line might send ETH toward the main hurdle at $4,400 and the 50-day simple moving average. The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,761 swing high to the $3,832 low is also near $4,400. If there is a clear move above $4,400, the price could drift toward $4,550. A daily close above $4,550 may perhaps open the doors for a fresh uptrend. In the stated case, ETH could rise toward $4,750. Any more gains above $4,750 level could initiate a larger rally toward $4,880 level. The next key stop for the bulls could be near the $5,000 handle. If Ethereum fails to start a recovery wave above $4,250 or $4,400, there could be more losses. Immediate support on the downside is $4,050. The first major area of interest for the bulls could be near the $3,820 level. A clear break and close below $3,820 could spark a sharp decline and larger downside correction. In the stated scenario, Ether might decline toward $3,600. The next key level sits near the $3,360 level. If the bulls fail to protect $3,360, the bears might aim for a move toward $3,200. Any more losses might derail the current uptrend and send ETH to $3,020 in the coming weeks. Overall, Ethereum price is consolidating losses below $4,250 and $4,400. If there is no close above $4,400, the price could restart its decline and drop toward $3,600.",Coinchapter,2025-10-01T09:17:48Z,https://coinchapter.com/ethereum-outlook-eth-bulls-not-safe/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.889147,0.03529411764705892

Rethinking slavery at the Cape,"Rethinking slavery at the Cape: Although slavery was common, the Cape was not a 'slave economy' in the strict sense, as it did not rely solely on slavery for economic surplus, according to Lund University's Professor Erik Green Following the establishment of its trading post at the Cape, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) quickly began importing enslaved individuals. By 1705, approximately 85% of farmers in Stellenbosch - the center of crop farming at the Cape - enslaved people. Numerous scholars have argued that enslaved labor was central to the expansion of European settlement in the region (see Green 2022 for an overview). Slave labor enabled settlers to establish profitable farms by exploiting imported human capital. As illustrated in Figure 1, the enslaved soon outnumbered the European settlers. There is little doubt about the significance of slavery in Cape society. The legal and social right to own human beings was deeply embedded in the colony's cultural, social, and political fabric. However, the mere presence and widespread use of slavery does not necessarily mean that the Cape Colony constituted a 'slave economy' in a strict economic sense. A slave economy is typically defined as one in which slavery plays a central role in generating economic surplus. Historical data on the enslaved at the Cape is limited. They only appear as numbers in a column in the tax censuses (Opgaafrolle), which constitute the key historical sources used in the Cape of Good Hope research project (www.capepanel.org). Having said that, the transcription of the censuses allows us to further investigate the economic role of slavery at the Cape and hence contribute to the larger literature on the emergence and persistence of labour coercion. In earlier work, I have questioned the profitability of slave labor in the Cape agricultural economy (Green, 2014; 2022). Enslaved individuals were expensive, with limited data suggesting that the cost of purchasing a single enslaved person was roughly equivalent to the average annual income of a European farmer. While earlier studies (e.g., Worden 1985) posited that slave productivity at the Cape matched that of plantation economies in the Caribbean and the American South, more recent research drawing on detailed historical sources (Fourie & Green, 2015) indicates that productivity levels were comparatively modest. This raises an important question: why did settlers continue to use slave labor despite its seemingly limited economic returns? Part of the answer lies in pure economics. Slavery often persisted for reasons related to social status and political power, long after it ceased to make economic sense. Nonetheless, in a context such as the Cape - where average settler wealth was significantly lower than in the New World -- slavery's persistence likely required some form of economic utility. To understand this dynamic, it is essential to consider that enslaved individuals were not only a source of labor but also served as a means to access capital. Settler-farmers at the Cape faced not only labor shortages but also severe capital constraints. The formal credit market was limited and largely controlled by a small number of institutional actors, including the VOC, the Orphan Chamber, churches, and a few companies. These entities accounted for only a small fraction of lending activity. In fact, 90% of lending transactions in the eighteenth-century Cape were carried out by private individuals, mostly settlers. Access to credit requires collateral. Although land was theoretically a valuable asset, most settlers did not own the land they cultivated and were thus unable to use it as security. They did, however, possess one asset over which they held full legal ownership: enslaved people. Unlike land, which was immobile and tied to uncertain future yields, enslaved individuals were mobile and could be sold in markets offering the most favorable conditions. In the context of capital scarcity typical of frontier economies, this made slave ownership highly correlated with indebtedness. Enslavers regularly pledged their human property as collateral to secure loans for investment, land acquisition, business ventures, consumption, and agricultural production. Recent research by Martins (2021) and Green and Martins (forthcoming) demonstrates that the use of enslaved individuals as collateral was fundamental to the survival and profitability of European settler farms at the Cape. These findings are significant for several reasons. First, they underscore that slavery was qualitatively different from other forms of coerced labor, such as serfdom or indentured servitude. Slavery granted the enslaver absolute property rights over another human being, enabling not only labor extraction but also access to capital markets. Equally important, this research highlights the unique and brutal nature of slavery at the Cape. Enslaved individuals were subjected to exploitation in ways unparalleled in other systems of coerced labor. Stripped of all legal rights and human dignity, they were effectively transformed into economic assets. As Orlando Patterson (1982) has famously argued, the enslaved were rendered 'socially dead.' The wealth generated by European settlers at the Cape would not have reached the same scale without the dual economic roles played by the enslaved, as both laborers and capital. Thus, the early economic history of South Africa is inextricably tied to systems of coercion and exploitation.",Open Access Government,2025-10-01T09:18:49Z,https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/article/rethinking-slavery-at-the-cape/199064/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.890310,-0.4823529411764705
Review: Black artist wants to be valued for her art in 'hilarious' novel,"Shannon Gibney, The Minnesota Star Tribune ""Little Movements"" Lauren Morrow's smart, incisive and hilarious debut, is an ode to the creative process and to people everywhere who feel the pull to take a risk and try something new. I have never read a book quite like this one, about the professional choreographic world, and featuring a deeply conflicted, 30-something, sardonic, Black female protagonist. It's been awhile since I enjoyed a book so much, and found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity and truth -- the truth of the absurdity -- in the world Morrow concocts. Dare I say this is an experience many readers need, especially right now? Layla Smart has been mostly happily married to an unsuccessful white screenwriter-turned-IT-guy in Brooklyn when she receives an offer for a residency at Briar House, an exclusive (and very white) dance center in rural Vermont. Although she and her husband Eli are nervous about being apart, they agree (at least on the surface) that she has to take it. People are also reading... HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Prep Predictions for Sept. 26, 2025 FRIDAY'S HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP: Jeb Stewart (Patrick Henry), Parker Lowe (Honaker), Cole Barnette (Rye Cove), Rayvon Jones (Union), Eli Tweed (Holston), Colin Hill (Ridgeview), Corey Byrd (Gate City) among many stars; VHS vs. Grayson County suspended until Monday Emory & Henry to add six members to its board of trustees HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Isaac Smith engineers late scoring drives as George Wythe rallies for 33-32 win over Rural Retreat Abingdon dental clinic breaks ground on expansion Council approves tax rebate incentive for prospective restaurant HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Four teams in Far SWVA are unbeaten, impressive; A look back at last week and a brief look at the upcoming schedule THURSDAY'S HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP: Erin South (Patrick Henry), Makenna Dye (Honaker), Leah Rasnake (Grundy), Sara Doss (Sullivan East), Sydney Clark (Tennessee High) among many stars Suit donations help King launch career closet for students HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Garrett Dickison's long-distance house call sets the tone for Chilhowie in resounding win over previously unbeaten Northwood HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Jaalan Deel is the real deal at Ridgeview HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Lebanon Air Show earns rave reviews again behind Reece and Baker in win over Richlands HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: Tennessee High owns second half in 43-7 win over Abingdon, running winning streak to three games Glade Spring man charged, equipment recovered EO Companies acquires former Abingdon Food City location Once there, she meets Margot, the controlling artistic director of Briar House -- an older white woman who is at once overly invested in the success of Layla's work, and doggedly focused on its ""Black"" aspects. As the story and Layla's residency progress, we learn Briar House is not what it presents itself to be, and neither is Eli. ""There weren't many opportunities for escape in adulthood. That had been part of the appeal of Briar House, time away from everything,"" Layla says. ""I had felt like I'd figured out a loophole when I signed the paperwork. But now -- chilled to the bone, cheeks chapped, belly full, mind bent, heart broken -- Briar House felt like a disaster."" Layla is at times ambivalent about the role of her Blackness in her art. This is a topic I rarely see explored in fiction in such a nuanced way, reflecting the complexity of institutional investment in appearing ""anti-racist,"" how funding and opportunities are often tied to a certain performance of race, and the racial anxieties and contradictions these pressures exert on Black artists. After discovering the real reason she was awarded the residency, Layla muses, ""It was time to cleanse their palate with a Black artist. Something that spoke to the current moment. Now that Briar House had reached financial stability, they needed to show they were in step with the zeitgeist."" When the board is confronted with their negligence and racism, Morrow writes that they ""had nothing real to say. Harold apologized for the way everything had unfolded...They were all disappointed, but it had been a matter of Briar House surviving or not... But we should all rest assured -- the board planned to make a donation to the ACLU on behalf of the organization."" I cracked up when I read this, recognizing the tepid convictions most institutions espouse when they find themselves in a racist corner they cannot easily get out of. I imagine every Black and brown artist has experienced some version of this at some point in their career. In the end, this short, focused novel -- by a woman who used to do public relations for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater -- asks each of us to explore the artistic visions that may have eluded us, through the clouded view of our fears and attachments. It beautifully (and amusingly) asks us to acknowledge the pitfalls the illusion of stability engenders, in order to embrace a fuller, more courageous life. ____ Little Movements By: Lauren Morrow.

Emerald Packaging and Walmart launch 30% PCR potato bag,"Emerald Packaging and Walmart have released a new type of packaging for the potato industry, which incorporates 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content. This product is the first of its kind in the category and has been developed in partnership with Idaho Package and Wada Farms. The development is part of Walmart's Project Gigaton, which seeks to cut or prevent one billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions across its global supply chain by 2030. Walmart vice-president of produce sourcing Laura Himes stated: ""We are proud to collaborate with Emerald Packaging, Idaho Package and Wada Farms to introduce the first 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) bag for the potato category. ""This initiative directly supports our goal to minimise waste with the integration of PCR content for retail packaging and demonstrates our dedication to working with suppliers who share our commitment to a more sustainable future."" Wada Farms, a potato grower and shipper, played a key role in the product's development and market readiness. Trials for the new packaging began in the autumn of 2024, conducted by Idaho Package and Wada Farms. Following successful trials, Walmart launched the PCR potato bags at the end of the year. By June 2025, Walmart had begun to shift additional root vegetable stock-keeping units (SKUs) to the recycled-content format. About a dozen SKUs now use PCR resin, reducing virgin polyethylene usage by more than 100,000 lbs. Emerald Packaging CEO Kevin Kelly stated: ""We've worked on sustainable packaging initiatives for over 20 years, and PCR has emerged as the first affordable option ever. ""We built a supply chain and launched a product that met or exceeded the PCR targets of major retailers. ""We did so without compromising product performance and a nominal cost impact. Our commitment to PCR aligned perfectly with Walmart's goal to incorporate it in their packaging."" ""Emerald Packaging and Walmart launch 30% PCR potato bag "" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.",Yahoo!

Middle-Class Shoplifting: The Unexpected Thrill-Seeking Trend - Internewscast Journal,"Authorities have noticed a growing trend of middle-class individuals shoplifting 'for the thrill' in one of the UK's wealthiest university cities, Cambridge. As shoplifting rates surge across the UK, Cambridge police have been tackling thefts, only to find that many perpetrators are stealing luxury goods merely for amusement. Cambridgeshire Constabulary has released CCTV footage of thieves targeting John Lewis in the historic city amid the increase. This increase comes alongside a 20 percent rise in shoplifting incidents, with 530,643 offences recorded in England and Wales up to March 2025, marking an all-time high. Recently released video footage captures a mother-daughter duo taking 90 minutes to try on clothes in a three-level department store, while stashing away items they planned to steal in their handbags. Another clip shows a woman spraying perfume from a tester before brazenly dropping it into an already full shopping bag. Police say these offenders, targeting high-end stores, are not stealing out of necessity but 'for the thrill of it'. Cambridge, home to one of the best universities in the world, is one of the UK's richest cities. The county as a whole saw a 22 percent increase this year in shoplifting compared to 2024, with 874 offences recorded in Cambridge city centre alone. According to PC Emily-Jayne Matthews from Cambridgeshire Police, a significant portion of thefts in Cambridge involve older, middle-class individuals who have stable jobs and nice homes. She runs a Facebook campaign called Wanted Wednesdays where she posts images of suspects and says many turn themselves in for fear of being exposed. Caught shoplifters have to pay for the items, receive a lifetime ban from the shop and must apologise in person. PC Matthews told ITV News Anglia: 'These aren't people stealing out of necessity, they're people in professional jobs, taking high-end items like clothing and perfume, simply for the thrill. 'I've had one suspect in interview, when she was banned from John Lewis and Waitrose, say: 'Where am I going to get my weekly food shop?' 'The embarrassment is often the strongest deterrent.' In July, the-then policing and crime minister Dame Diana Johnson claimed middle class shoplifters were responsible for pushing up prices on the high street. Filled with determination to crack down on Britain's spiralling shoplifting epidemic, she said: 'It's a crime. If you're middle class, or whichever class you want to determine that you are, it's a crime. That is just not acceptable because we all know that people end up paying higher prices if people are stealing.' In a bid to combat the crime, which is crippling the retail sector and pushing up prices, the government previously announced plans to invest £200million into neighbourhood policing. It comes after the government also axed previous legislation that made stealing goods worth less than £200 a 'summary-only' offence. There are also plans to make assaulting a shopkeeper a specific offence under the Crime and Policing Bill. The rise in shoplifting offences is attributed to multiple factors including the cost of living crisis and increase in self-service check-outs. On average, 793 offences a day went unsolved in the last year.",Internewscast Journal,2025-10-01T09:15:07Z,https://internewscast.com/news/middle-class-shoplifting-the-unexpected-thrill-seeking-trend/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.891662,0.1294117647058823

The cryptocurrency market is moving at a rapid pace this week. Binance Coin has reclaimed the $1,017 level with a 1.35% daily gain. Hyperliquid traders are eyeing an ambitious price range of $30.41 to $119.56, and BullZilla's presale continues to attract early investors with another scheduled price increase. The global market remains on alert as top presale cryptos to buy today dominate headlines. From exchange-backed heavyweights like Binance Coin to high-risk newcomers such as BullZilla, traders are comparing established ecosystems with new altcoin opportunities today. Hyperliquid, with its wide forecast range, highlights how next-gen decentralized exchanges could redefine 2025 liquidity.

Whether you're planning short-term crypto investments or scouting the best crypto presale to join now, these three assets present distinct pathways for different risk appetites. Binance Coin (BNB) remains a cornerstone for traders seeking reliable exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token's latest move, a 1.35% increase in 24 hours to $1,017.09, solidifies its position among the top presale cryptos to buy today, particularly for those comparing Binance Coin with new crypto presales. The Binance ecosystem continues to expand globally, adding new fiat gateways and regional trading pairs. This worldwide reach strengthens BNB's utility and supports its market ranking as a top rated exchange token. Investors focused on short-term crypto investments are watching key resistance near $1,050, a potential breakout that could open the door to monthly highs. From a trust perspective, BNB stands as an official, verified asset with years of proven liquidity. While it's not itself a presale token, many investors use BNB profits to diversify into the best crypto presale to join now, blending stability with early-stage growth. For traders evaluating Binance Coin vs new crypto presales, the lesson is clear: combine a reliable market leader with carefully selected presale opportunities to capture both immediate and future gains. BullZilla remains one of the top presale cryptos to buy today, thanks to a roaring community and a presale model that rewards speed. BullZilla sits in Stage 4 (Red Candle Buffet) with a current price of $0.00010574. Over 29 billion tokens have been sold to more than 2,000 holders, and the presale tally exceeds $730k.

Analysts note that Hyperliquid could benefit from the same narrative that lifted other DeFi giants, especially if liquidity mining incentives attract a global user base. Its market-wide appeal underscores why it appears on nearly every crypto presale list 2025. Still, such a wide target range highlights risk.

XRP Moves Closer to Banking Mainstream: Why It Matters | BitcoinChaser,"Ripple's XRP is moving closer to banking adoption after Thunes expanded its network to connect Ripple-powered payments with SWIFT. XRP isn't suddenly ""approved"" by U.S. regulators, but something real is happening: global payment rails are starting to integrate Ripple's technology at scale. The latest move comes from Thunes, a major cross-border payments network, which just connected Ripple-powered liquidity into the SWIFT banking system. That means Ripple's reach now extends to more than 11,000 banks -- a milestone that bridges the gap between blockchain innovation and the traditional banking network. For crypto gamblers, this development matters because easier, cheaper, and faster movement of money between banks and crypto-friendly platforms could reshape how players deposit, withdraw, and move profits. Some social posts claimed the U.S. had officially allowed banks to use XRP -- that's not true. What is true is that banks and payment processors are becoming comfortable using Ripple's infrastructure since the SEC lawsuit over XRP largely resolved in 2023. The case clarified that exchange-based sales of XRP weren't securities transactions, removing a key regulatory fear. Now, infrastructure companies are leaning in. Thunes has expanded its Pay-to-Banks service using existing SWIFT connectivity, giving Ripple liquidity access to 11,000 banks without the need to integrate new systems. This quietly removes one of the biggest barriers to adoption: technical friction. Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse, has said Ripple aims to capture up to 14% of SWIFT's volume. Moves like the Thunes expansion demonstrate that the company is serious about competing with -- or complementing -- legacy systems, rather than waiting for permission. If banks and major payment networks continue adopting Ripple, XRP could become one of the most convenient coins to move in and out of crypto casinos. Players already use fast, low-cost networks like Solana and Polygon, but these are still less familiar to the wider public. Mainstream adoption would make XRP an appealing middle ground -- faster and cheaper than Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet more recognizable and widely supported than niche alternatives. With SWIFT connectivity and improved banking comfort, XRP offers: Casinos are highly motivated to offer cheaper, faster options -- not just for players but also for their own liquidity and payment costs. Thunes' move shows that the conversation is shifting from ""can we legally use XRP?"" to ""how do we plug it in without breaking existing systems?"" By riding on SWIFT's rails instead of trying to replace them overnight, Ripple is creating a hybrid model: blockchain speed with bank-grade reach. It's also timely. SWIFT itself has been testing blockchain settlement models and working with companies like Consensys. Legacy systems recognize the need for modernization, and Ripple is positioning XRP as a ready-made liquidity bridge. This isn't a U.S. government stamp of approval -- it's something more practical: infrastructure quietly opening up so banks and institutions can use XRP when it makes sense. For gamblers and casino operators, that could mean faster payouts, cheaper deposits, and a payment experience closer to instant. If you're using crypto for betting, these kinds of real integrations -- not hype headlines -- are what matter. They show XRP's role in global payments is moving from theory to practice, and that momentum could eventually change how easily players fund and cash out.",BitcoinChaser,2025-10-01T09:16:01Z,https://bitcoinchaser.com/xrp-moves-closer-to-banking-mainstream/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.893652,0.2313725490196079

FIRS: Taxes now contribute 70% of monthly allocations - The Nation Newspaper,"The Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Dr. Zacch Adedeji, has disclosed that nearly 70 per cent of funds shared at monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meetings now come from taxes collected by the agency. Adedeji disclosed this in an interview marking his two years in office, where he said the surge in tax revenue has strengthened fiscal stability across the country. According to him, improved collections have enabled 30 states to repay N1.85 trillion in debts within the past 18 months. ""Debt servicing costs that once consumed 90 per cent of government revenue have now dropped to about 50 per cent. External reserves have also grown on the back of stronger fiscal stability,"" he said. The FIRS boss praised President Bola Tinubu's administration for creating a tax environment that eases compliance. ""The president has fulfilled his campaign promise to simplify tax compliance and remove hurdles faced by taxpayers,"" Adedeji noted. Adedeji explained that the government's tax reforms -- the most far-reaching since independence -- are designed to reduce the burden on citizens while improving government revenue. He pointed out that food, education, shared transportation, and agriculture have been exempted from value-added tax (VAT). ""The reforms are already yielding results. Nigeria's tax-to-GDP ratio has risen from 10 per cent to 13.5 per cent in just two years, with a target of 18 per cent by 2027. In August alone, the federation account disbursed a record N2 trillion,"" he stated. The FIRS chairman admitted that the transition has not been without difficulties. ""It is like the pain of a woman in labour,"" he said, while stressing that government interventions are already helping to cushion the effects. These include the rollout of compressed natural gas (CNG) buses and crude-for-naira support for local refiners, which he said are already reflecting in fuel prices. Adedeji outlined how the new consolidated tax law strengthens compliance by restructuring FIRS operations. Taxpayers are now segmented into small, medium, and large categories, with one-stop shops created to ease filing and payments. ""We are service providers to taxpayers rather than just an enforcement agency. When companies are doing well, expanding, and making profits, we will benefit from their growth. Our task is to remove hurdles in their way, and that is what the president has done with these new laws,"" he explained. He also clarified the decision to rename the FIRS as the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS). ""The word 'federal' gave the wrong impression that we only collect for the Federal Government. In reality, we collect VAT, of which 90 per cent belongs to the states,"" he said. On the controversial petrol surcharge included in the new law, Adedeji assured that it would not apply automatically. ""It will only take effect if activated by a ministerial order and published in the official gazette,"" he noted. Adedeji said the consolidation of multiple tax laws into a single code -- set to take effect in January -- will simplify Nigeria's tax system. The new framework reduces the number of tax types to single digits, eliminates tax for businesses with annual turnover below N50 million, and adjusts personal income tax thresholds to shield low-income earners. On June 26, 2025, President Tinubu signed into law four major bills: the Nigeria Tax Act, Nigeria Tax Administration Act, Nigeria Revenue Service Establishment Act, and the Joint Revenue Board Establishment Act. The laws aim to broaden the tax base, improve compliance, and enhance transparency across all tiers of government. Adedeji further linked Nigeria's fiscal improvement to Tinubu's wider economic reforms. ""The health of the federation account has blossomed greatly, as there are no bogus subsidy claims to deplete the pool,"" he said, referring to the removal of fuel subsidy and the unification of exchange rates.","Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",2025-10-01T09:17:06Z,https://thenationonlineng.net/firs-taxes-now-contribute-70-of-monthly-allocations/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.895065,0.2941176470588236
Tricky electrification makes H2 key for trucks: Daimler | Latest Market News,"Hydrogen is still set for a key role in decarbonising heavy transport as electrification presents challenges for trucks, according to German vehicle manufacturer Daimler Truck. Battery-electric vehicles are widely considered the way forward for decarbonising the mobility sector, but hydrogen-powered trucks could represent a ""significant proportion"" of heavy-duty transport by 2030, Daimler Truck's chief executive Karin Radstrom said at the European Hydrogen Week in Brussels. ""If we are serious about decarbonising transport"" hydrogen will have to play a role because ""it is going to be very difficult with battery electric [vehicles] only"". Europe has a fleet of 6mn diesel trucks, of which around 30,000 are electric, Radstrom said. Some customers ""can run [electric trucks] on cost parity with diesel trucks"" but many are concerned about the lack of high-speed charging infrastructure, said Radstrom. Limits to the electricity grid make ""rapid large-scale expansion [of electric truck fleets] unfeasible"" in Europe. Setting up a network of hydrogen refuelling stations is easier and less costly than scaling up the network of recharging points, Radstrom said. Hydrogen fuel cell trucks can be better positioned for fleet operators that need to transport higher payloads and run longer distances. But hydrogen adoption ""will depend on the price at the pump"", which should be brought down to around €4-5/kg ($3.5-4.4/kg), according to Radstrom. This would represent a sharp decrease from existing prices above €11/kg in Germany, the EU country with the largest number of refuelling stations. Radstrom also sees supply chain advantages for hydrogen-powered trucks. Fuel cells do not use any ""critical components from Asia"" unlike electric trucks that use lithium-ion batteries and rare earth-containing electric motors, components were Chinese companies in particular dominate the supply chains, Radstrom said. The Global Hydrogen Mobility Alliance, a group bringing together hydrogen infrastructure developers and mobility companies, this week called for measures to accelerate adoption of hydrogen in heavy mobility and expansion of refuelling stations network. Scaling up hydrogen in mobility requires a flexible approach to hydrogen sourcing, including adoption of supply with unabated emissions in a transition period, ahead of a wider switch to lower-carbon and renewable supply when costs have come down, the group said.",Argus Media,2025-10-01T09:18:39Z,https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2737539-tricky-electrification-makes-h2-key-for-trucks-daimler,2025-10-01 17:26:54.895373,0.05882352941176472
22 million paying over the odds for energy bills - here's how to save up to £715,"By switching providers, households can save an average of £271, and 1 in 10 can save up to £715 per year. Although energy bills fell by 7% in July to £1,720 for the average household, they are still almost £500 a year more than the average energy bill in April 2021, and are expected to rise by another £100 in April next year Alastair Douglas, Below, TotallyMoney CEO, says the best way to save is to switch: ""The reality is that you won't be left without heating or electricity. Your pipes and plugs stay the same, and the only change is who sends you the bill. ""Most switches take place within seven working days, and your new supplier handles all the paperwork - so you have nothing to worry about. They'll even contact your old supplier to cancel your account. All you'll need to do is give a final meter reading and you're done."" No, This is physically impossible because your gas and electricity flows through the same pipes and cables regardless of who is charging you. ""Engineers will only need to visit if you're moving house or getting a new meter installed. For a standard switch, no one needs to come to your home,"" says Alastair. He adds: ""Energy firms need to be more transparent with customers, because these myths are not only leaving households cold, but also out of pocket. 22 million are currently paying the maximum amount suppliers are allowed to charge for energy. ""Loyalty doesn't pay, but changing energy suppliers can - and that's why we've launched a new energy switching service. Comparing providers takes minutes, and your energy supply won't be affected during the changeover. So, check to see if you're free to switch, and if you've not changed providers in the last year, then it's likely that you can start saving money."" (Image: Nous) Greg Marsh, household finance expert and CEO of AI money-saving tool Nous.co, agrees: ""Most can save hundreds of pounds a year by switching to a new fixed deal. Households who switch with Nous.co typically save more than £150."" He also recommends making sure your direct debit is set at the right level. ""It's a good idea to have some credit built up around now, but not too much. If you've got credit worth more than twice what you pay each month in credit, you should reduce your monthly payments,"" he says. -- Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) September 22, 2025 He says: ""If your home doesn't have a smart meter, take a manual reading on the day, or as soon as you can afterwards. Otherwise you may be charged for too much energy under the new price cap. ""Turning the thermostat in your home down by just 1°C can reduce your energy bills by as much as 10%, for a typical household that's around £17 a month."" If given the go-ahead, new tariffs could be available by the end of January. Standing charges are applied daily, regardless of how much energy the customer uses, and are used to cover the cost of supplying energy to homes and businesses. They also cover the costs of building new network infrastructure and keeping the power on when energy suppliers go bust. Recommended reading: Martin McCluskey, minister for energy consumers, says of the reduced Standing Charge proposals: ""Consumers should have freedom and choice when choosing an energy tariff that works for them. ""This proposal will make more tariffs available on the market, giving people more options to pay lower standing charges if that suits their needs. ""It is an important step towards building an energy market that puts families first and we will continue to look at how we can go further."" Ofgem said the new lower standing charge tariff mandate would be likely to only be a short-term measure while it moots permanent changes to allocate costs within the system, as the UK shifts towards renewable energy.",Bicester Advertiser,2025-10-01T08:19:13Z,https://www.bicesteradvertiser.net/news/bicesteradnews/25507814.ofgem-price-cap-22-million-paying-maximum-energy-bills/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.895804,0.1294117647058823
Big Diwali Gift! Cabinet approves 3% Dearness Allowance hike for central government employees based on 7th Pay Commission News24 -,"8th Pay Commission: The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved a 3% increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) for Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners. Effective from January 1, 2025, this revision increases the DA and DR by 3. Currently, DA stands at 55% of basic pay. This will be increased to 58%. This time it is going to be a double Diwali Damaka for the Central government employees and the pensioners, as the announcement on the dearness allowance(DA) hike can be expected before Diwali. Experts estimate a 3% increase in DA this time, amid a cooling inflation trend. Currently, DA stands at 55% of basic pay. This will be increased to 58% if the announcement is made. Additionally, there is more good news for central government employees and pensioners. Read on to know the latest updates on the 8th Pay Commission. The hike will benefit over 1.2 crore employees and pensioners in the country before this Diwali. The DA hike is usually announced twice a year, in February-March and in September-October, with effect from January and July of that year. It is meant to help employees manage the rising cost of living due to inflation. According to National Confederation of Government Employees, the commission is expected to be effective from January 1, 2026. Under this, new salary structures and allowances will be implemented for central government employees and pensioners. The 8th CPC will be replacing the 7th pay commission, hiking the salaries and pensions of the employees. The implementation of the 8th Pay Commission is expected to be majorly in 2026; however, the possibility of delay is also on the cards. The key proposal in 8th CPC, which is expected from January 2026, will impact over 1 crore employees and pensioners. The key proposal is to raise the fitment factor from 2.57 in the 7th CPC to 2.86. If approved, the minimum salary of the central government employees could increase from Rs 18,000 to Rs 51,480 and the minimum pension from Rs 9,000 to Rs 25,740. This will be in addition to hikes in allowances like DA, HRA, and TA. Approximately 5 million central government employees and 6.5 million pensioners will benefit from its implementation, as it will result in a 30-34 percent increase in salaries and pensions. Overall, approximately 11.5 million people will directly benefit from this. It is estimated that the new fitment factor could be between 1.83 and 2.86, which will directly impact employees' basic salaries. The government has approved the 8th Pay Commission, but the formal establishment of the commission and the notification of its terms of reference (ToR) are yet to be issued. The minimum basic pay for Level 1 employees could be revised to ₹51,480, while the minimum pension could increase by approximately ₹20,500 to ₹25,740.",News24,2025-10-01T09:16:57Z,https://news24online.com/business/big-diwali-gift-cabinet-approves-3-dearness-allowance-hike-for-central-government-employees-pensioners-based-on-7th-8th-pay-commission/644240/,2025-10-01 17:26:54.896111,0.2862745098039217
Tips to stay covered and safe on South African roads | Comaro Chronicle,"Learn why keeping your car safe and legal is essential to protect your cover and avoid costly claim rejections. Vehicle insurance is designed to protect you in times of need, but that protection could vanish if your vehicle isn't roadworthy. Insurers have the legal right to reject a claim if a car's poor condition is found to have caused or contributed to an accident. Here's how to protect your cover and your safety: * Your car must meet the legal safety standards outlined in the National Road Traffic Act 93 of 1996. * Roadworthiness includes working lights, effective brakes, legal tyre tread depth, safe steering mechanisms, and more. * It's not a one-time requirement at registration but an ongoing obligation. * Most insurance policies require your vehicle to be roadworthy at all times. * If your car fails to meet basic safety requirements, insurers can legally reject your claim. * Even with valid insurance, your claim may be denied if your car contributed to the accident. * Worn-out tyres and faulty brake systems are among the top reasons insurers reject claims. * A tread that's level with tread wear indicators is legally unroadworthy - regardless of age or mileage. * Brakes that are worn or uneven may not only cause accidents but also invalidate your cover. * Insurers must show that the vehicle's condition contributed to the accident. * If your car is unroadworthy but didn't influence the incident, the claim might still be upheld. For example, if worn brakes played no role in an accident caused by swerving to avoid a pothole, insurers can't use the brake condition as grounds for rejection. * In one case, a worn tyre led to aquaplaning and a crash. The claim was rightfully rejected. * In another case, poor brake condition had no bearing on the accident, and the insurer was ordered to pay out. * Check tyre tread depth regularly and replace tyres before they become borderline illegal. * Maintain your brakes - If they feel spongy, squeak, or cause pulling, have them checked immediately. * Stick to your service schedule and don't ignore your manufacturer's maintenance recommendations. * Service history and repair receipts can support your case in the event of a dispute. * Keeping your vehicle roadworthy is not just a legal obligation; it's a moral and contractual one. * Roadworthy vehicles reduce accident risks for you and others. * Ignoring maintenance could mean paying for repairs out-of-pocket, including third-party damages.

Farmers: New fertiliser policy may raise price - The Nation Newspaper,"The Coalition of Farmers Association of Nigeria (COFAN) and the Himma Youth Farmers Association of Nigeria (HYFAN) have raised concerns that the restructuring of the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) by the Federal Government could lead to a sharp increase in the prices, threatening the productivity of smallholder and youth farmers. The groups commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his agricultural reforms and programmes aimed at boosting food security, farmer empowerment, and youth inclusion. However, they warned that the new direction of the PFI risks undermining the progress achieved under former President Muhammadu Buhari. ""The PFI was a cornerstone of Nigeria's agricultural transformation, ensuring affordable fertilizer through raw material importation and support for local blending plants. Millions of farmers benefitted from this intervention, which strengthened food production and national food security,"" Bamai said. The farmers' associations urged President Tinubu not to abandon the importation of raw materials until local production is capable of meeting national demand. They also called for the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI) to continue managing importation, arguing that this would guarantee efficiency, transparency, and stability in the supply chain. ""Nigerian farmers cannot afford a disruption in fertilizer supply at this critical moment.

Women's EmpowHer Summit discusses resilience during Hurricane Helene,"NORTH AUGUSTA -- When Hurricane Helene hit the CSRA, it was an all-hands-on-deck situation. Several women stepped into leadership roles during the storm and worked to make sure the community recovered. The second annual EmpowHer Summit was held in North Augusta with a focus on women in STEM and how they, in their career fields, helped the community recover from Helene. The event was part of the North Augusta Chamber of Commerce's Women in Business series, held every few months. Last year, the summit was held the day before Helene struck the area and left widespread damage. The event also honored a local woman who serves as a leader in their community. Augusta University professor and Bright Creative owner Clarissa Gainey was awarded the Woman Who EmpowHers award. ""The EmpowHer Award is not only the recognition of individual achievement, but also the celebration of the ripple effect created when women lead with courage, compassion and purpose,"" said North Augusta Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Terra Carroll. Gainey is a professional graphic designer. ""I want to thank you and this is a great honor,"" Gainey said after she received the award. Other finalists for the award were Donna Gentile of Antonio's Italian Eatery and Heather Johnson of Southpaw Roofing. The summit also included a panel of women who work in STEM careers who talked about their roles during Helene. Augusta-Richmond County Vity Administrator Tameka Allen served as the moderator of the event. Rhona Davis, civil engineer and vice president of transportation with Goodwyn Mills Cawood, said before the storm her company monitored Augusta's stormwater systems. She said ponds had reached flood levels but receded afterward. ""The stormwater system across the CSRA did a good job in handling things,"" she said. Another panelist, Vontice Jackson, who serves as the outreach coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said her department held preparedness events and educated the community on how to prepare, in partnership with local and state agencies. ""We were kind of preparing anyway, but we just weren't prepared for Hurricane Helene,"" said Vontice Jackson, outreach coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Tina Johannsen, a wildlife biologist for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, said her team anticipated a hurricane but had to focus on resilience. She said wildlife populations weren't directly impacted, but fallen timber became a major issue. ""We knew that a hurricane was about to come, but certainly no one was prepared for Helene,"" she said. ""It really brought home to us that we manage the lands we are responsible for in a way that keeps them resilient. Connie Melchert, executive director of operations at Piedmont Augusta, said the hospital's emergency planning had been shaped by lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""One thing we learned from that is to change the environment and change policies,"" she said. She explained that during Helene, the hospital set up an incident command center, emphasizing the importance of frequent communication. Staff planned for ""what if"" scenarios such as loss of power or water and boil-water notices. She gave the example of patients with left ventricular assist devices, which require constant battery power. While these patients didn't need medical treatment, they needed reliable electricity. Others with oxygen tanks also required access to power. Melchert added that the hospital also saw an increase in heat-related cases, chainsaw injuries and stomach illnesses from spoiled food. ""We can provide on the fly and move those patients with minimal needs to the Summerville campus to keep the access available to the emergency room,"" she said. Allen closed the summit by offering advice to young girls in attendance. ""If there is any advice I can give to the seniors and the students, it is to go into what you love to do,"" she said. ""Don't go into it for the money because it is something you will live to do from day to day.""",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/northaugusta/news/womens-empowher-summit-discusses-resilience-during-hurricane-helene/article_73b605a9-a8c2-4672-bb08-7a1df91e103f.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.226581,0.2941176470588236

Farmers: New fertiliser policy may trigger price hike - The Nation Newspaper,"The Coalition of Farmers Association of Nigeria (COFAN) and the Himma Youth Farmers Association of Nigeria (HYFAN), have raised concerns that the restructuring of the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) by the Federal Government could lead to a sharp increase prices, that could threaten the productivity of smallholder and youth farmers. The groups commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his agricultural reforms and programmes aimed at boosting food security, farmer empowerment, and youth inclusion. However, they warned that the new direction of the PFI risks undermining the progress achieved earlier. ""The PFI was a cornerstone of Nigeria's agricultural transformation, ensuring affordable fertilizer through raw material importation and support for local blending plants. Millions of farmers benefitted from this intervention, which strengthened food production and national food security,"" Bamai said. The farmers' associations urged President Tinubu not to abandon the importation of raw materials until local production is capable of meeting national demand.

Israeli Military Says to Block Access to North Gaza for Residents from South,"Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Masoud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Bafel Talabani meet. (Rudaw) The Iraqi Kurdistan Region remains without a government nearly a year since parliamentary elections were held in the region. The influential parties have been unable to agree on a cabinet lineup, reflecting the extent of the political divisions and complications even as Iraq prepares to hold its own elections in November. The Kurdish polls on October 20, 2024, led to the election of 100 lawmakers with the dominant Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), led by Masoud Barzani, winning 39 seats and its rival the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by Bafel Talabani, winning 23. The two parties, which enjoy a simple majority in parliament, could have easily formed a new government, but complicated disputes have hampered their efforts. They have been holding intense talks in recent days to form a cabinet, but observers believe they won't lead anywhere. Rather, the KDP and PUK will likely await the results of the general elections in Iraq and reach some form of deal with the federal authorities before forming a new government in Kurdistan. The presidency of Kurdistan and position of its prime minister have often gone to the KDP, while the president of the federal republic has often gone to a figure from the PUK. On Saturday, Barzani and Talabani held talks in an effort to overcome the political deadlock. A senior source from the KDP told Kurdistan 24 that they have made progress in efforts to form a new government. He expected the Kurdish parliament to meet in the next two weeks, while sources from both parties said they will hold more talks ahead of agreeing on a lineup. Should they succeed, it will be the Kurdistan Region's tenth government after it separated from Baghdad in the 1990s. Kurdish sources have tied the progress in government talks to Talabani's visit to Washington last week. They told Asharq Al-Awsat that the United States has been pressuring the KDP and PUK to form a new government. Observers have said that the deadlock has been negatively impacting Kurdistan and drawing the ire of voters as elections draw near. A report by the STOP Organization for Monitoring and Development, an NGO in Kurdistan, said this has been the longest government deadlock witnessed in the region. The caretaker government has continued to issue decisions and sign strategic contracts since October 2022, which is when it started to operate in a caretaker capacity, it noted. Moreover, it said Kurdish lawmakers have been earning a full salary, without performing their parliamentary duties, which is a waste of public funds. Media aide to the KDP leader Kifah Mahmoud told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Kurdish parties have ""delayed in forming a new government for several reasons,"" which he mostly blamed on the PUK and the political situation in Iraq, as well as malign meddling by parties he did not name. He noted that the delay has not impacted the overall performance of the caretaker government, adding that the cooperation between the KDP and PUK leaderships has given the cabinet additional support. He did acknowledge that government formation efforts are in their final stages and that a lineup may be announced before the November elections. Leading member of the PUK Soran Dawde stressed that the party is keen on the formation of a government as soon as possible. Talabani's frequent visits to the Kurdistan capital Erbil are evidence of his determination to end the impasse, he told Asharq Al-Awsat. Furthermore, he dismissed accusations that the PUK was behind the delay, hoping that the intense meetings between Barzani and Talabani were a sign that a new government will be formed soon. Meanwhile, political analyst Kadhim Yawer said the ""high demands"" by both parties are one of the reasons for the delay. Each one wants more government seats and they are eyeing the seats allocated to the Kurdish parties in the federal government, which is creating complications and obstacles, he told Asharq Al-Awsat. The federal government will be formed after the November elections.",Asharq Al-Awsat English,2025-10-01T09:18:13Z,https://english.aawsat.com/node/5192446,2025-10-01 17:26:57.227195,0.2156862745098038
LCCI: Economic signals at 65 positive - The Nation Newspaper,"The President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Gabriel Idahosa, has said the nation's key economic indicators are showing renewed signs of growth as the country marks its 65th independence anniversary, dahosa, however, in a statement yesterday, warned that the outlook required cautious optimism and sustained reforms. He said the milestone offered both a moment of celebration and sober reflection on the nation's economy and business environment. ""Key indicators are showing some positive trends worth highlighting such as accelerating economic growth, productive recovery in the oil and gas sector, easing inflation, currency appreciation and strengthening external reserves,"" he said. He noted that for the first time since 2020, the monetary authorities had eased interest rates to 27 per cent after a series of hikes triggered by inflationary pressures, while significant tax reforms were underway. ""These developments create a cautiously optimistic business climate; one that offers opportunity but demands sustained policy discipline and private-sector agility,"" he added. The LCCI president observed that the country's improving macroeconomic backdrop presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses. According to him, exporters and manufacturers can take advantage of stronger reserves and a relatively stable naira to manage foreign exchange exposures with greater certainty. Energy-related firms, he said, also stand to benefit from renewed activity in the oil sector. ""At the same time, inflation remains high enough to squeeze consumer purchasing power and margins, while the transition to new tax rules will temporarily increase compliance costs and require careful cash-flow planning,"" Idahosa cautioned. He urged the government to ensure a transparent and phased rollout of the new tax framework to reduce investor uncertainty. He also called for fiscal measures that target critical inputs, complementing prudent monetary policy to accelerate disinflation without eroding external reserves. Idahosa said the country must strengthen local content in oil-sector projects to translate export gains into jobs and industrial development. He urged the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to maintain open communication on foreign exchange policy to sustain market stability. On the way forward, he emphasised the importance of deepening structural reforms to ease the cost of doing business, prioritising infrastructure investments, and accelerating industrialisation policies to boost manufacturing. ""We expect to see the implementation of the 30 per cent Value-Addition Export Bill, passed by the National Assembly, and the Executive Order on Nigeria First Policy, to boost local manufacturing,"" he said. According to Idahosa, enhancing policy consistency, regulatory compliance, and SME support would build investor confidence and drive economic transformation. ""As we celebrate 65 years of nationhood, LCCI reaffirms its commitment to constructive advocacy, partnerships, and thought leadership in advancing Nigeria's economic transformation."" ""We remain confident that, with sustained reforms and collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors, Nigeria can unlock its immense potential and secure a prosperous future for its people,"" he added.","Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",2025-10-01T09:17:06Z,https://thenationonlineng.net/lcci-economic-signals-at-65-positive/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.227450,0.5686274509803921
This company spent $35M designing next-gen hospital bed,"EDEN PRAIRIE, Minnesota -- Agiliti has invested more than $35 million to develop a next-generation hospital bed, one that fits the needs of all kinds of patients and the health care workers taking care of them. The company that rents and services hospital equipment has moved into manufacturing its own bed after years of handling models from other manufacturers. ""When you eat your own cooking, you tend to be a better chef,"" said Tom Leonard, Agiliti's chief executive, during a visit to the company's Eagan service center. After four years of development, $30 million in research costs and $5 million more in manufacturing upgrades, Agiliti is ready to introduce its Essentia bed. The Essentia name is a nod to essential workers (not the Duluth health system) and was designed to make a health care worker's life easier and less physically taxing while being more comfortable and therapeutic for patients. Post-COVID hospital staffing levels remain thin, and Agiliti sees a market for hospital equipment that can benefit patients while reducing physical stress on staff. So Agiliti built its bed frame to address the needs they consistently heard from customers and patients on adjustable bed height, side rails and mattress retainers. ""We brought that feedback together into one bed so customers don't have to rent different beds that operate differently for different reasons,"" said Kristen Thurman, vice president of product management and clinical affairs at Agiliti. The Essentia bed and related accessories should be a major financial driver for the $1.2 billion company for years to come. ""Our success here is not just critical to the financial future of the business,"" Leonard said. ""I don't expect that this is the last product that we will manufacture."" Razor blade business model The Essentia bed was the direct result of manufacturing capability Agiliti got from its $230 million acquisition of Sizewise in 2021. Sizewise is a maker of hospital beds specializing in oversize frames and surfaces for the bariatric market. Leonard thinks of a hospital bed using the razor and razor-blade business model. The bed frame is the durable product and the surfaces (mattresses) are the replaceable items that pair with a frame. Depending on use, a hospital bed frame can last 10 years, while surfaces can last three to seven years. According to Leonard, the health care industry buys about 50,000 to 70,000 new hospital beds annually. Last year that was about a $2.5 billion market in the United States. Agiliti didn't disclose the purchase price of the Essentia bed, which is just now reaching the market after 1,000 patient days of final evaluation. Hospital beds from makers like Hillrom, SonderCare, Stryker and others can range from $2,000 to well over $10,000. The Essentia bed frames are being built in Kansas, and the surfaces are being built in California. The company also has some manufacturing capability in Mexico. According to Leonard, Agiliti made the decision to manufacture in the U.S. years ago, which has provided the company some advantages. ""We have very little impact today from the vacillations on tariffs,"" Leonard said. ""There's some things we have to source (internationally), but very little."" A decade of growth Leonard joined Agiliti in 2015 when the company was called Universal Hospital Services. At the time it had about $400 million in annual revenue, mainly from rental income, but was financially troubled. Under Leonard, the company added more maintenance and management services, expanded geographically and increased employment from 2,300 to nearly 6,000. ""We've done that not by trying to cut our way to success, but rather by investing in our growth,"" Leonard said. The firm changed its name to Agiliti in 2018. Agiliti had 2024 revenue of $1.2 billion; according to Leonard, about 30% of the revenue was associated with managing hospital beds, which includes the frames and mattresses. The company's growth also came while transitioning though private equity owners and a brief run as a publicly traded company. The company is currently owned by an affiliate of the private equity company Thomas H. Lee Partners. Agiliti owns or manages more than a million pieces of health care equipment, including beds, surgical equipment and stockpiles of emergency equipment for state and federal governments. Today more than 90% of hospitals in the United States are within 100 miles of one of Agiliti's more than 130 U.S. service centers that clean, maintain, inspect, repair and deploy hospital equipment through a fleet of more than 1,700 vehicles. The service center in Eagan opened in April 2024. At 32,000 square feet, it's among the larger Agiliti sites. Open 24/7, it employs about 35 people, maintains approximately 2,000 to 2,500 pieces of medical equipment in the facility and is responsible for about 5,000 additional pieces deployed in approximately 150 nearby hospitals, surgery centers or other health care facilities. Built from experience Agiliti has been one of the biggest purchasers of hospital beds from other manufacturers. As it serviced those beds over the years, the company got plenty of feedback on what worked and what didn't. The Essentia bed has a number of features to benefit both patients and caregivers. It's an integrated system with a frame that can accommodate different surfaces/mattresses meant for different types of patients. Those mattresses and surfaces can help prevent pressure wounds (bedsores) and help regulate body temperature to make sleep more comfortable. The frame itself can be lowered to a height of 11½ inches, which allows patients to sit on the edge of the bed and place their feet securely on the floor. The length and width of the frame are also adjustable. Bed rails are easily positioned to help patients steady themselves, but the rails can also easily move out of the way so staff can attend to patients without reaching. The main functions of the bed can be accessed at the foot of the bed and from either side. Menu functions are intuitive, the company says, and the various alarms and alerts associated with the bed are customizable. One of the bed's most unusual features addresses today's care procedures, which aim to get nearly all patients moving or at least in weight-bearing positions as soon as practical. The Essentia bed can tilt up to 20 degrees, higher than competitors. That tilt puts even the most immobile patients in weight-bearing positions that aid in recovery, and also helps prevent pressure sores. ""The more they can mobilize, the less pressure injuries they're going to get,"" said VP Thurman.",ArcaMax,2025-10-01T09:18:15Z,https://www.arcamax.com/knowledge/scienceandtech/technews/s-3869869,2025-10-01 17:26:57.227963,0.2705882352941176
Chery Concludes Middle East Extreme Trials as Chery Super Hybrid (CSH) Proves Its Ultimate Adaptability,"Doha, Qatar and Kuwait City, Kuwait and Dubai, United Arab Emirates-(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - From September 20 to 25, Chery conducted a land-sea-air extreme challenge under the theme ""Defy Nature, Respect Its Power"" in the Middle East. The flagship TIGGO9 CSH underwent rigorous tests across Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE. These tests-comprising high-salinity seawater immersion, sand burial in extreme heat desert, and a runway sprint against a jet aircraft-served to comprehensively validate the vehicle's battery endurance and overall performance under extreme conditions. After the tests, two brand-new TIGGO9 CSH vehicles embarked on a nearly 800-km cross-border endurance test from Kuwait and the UAE to Qatar.

Review: Black artist wants to be valued for her art in 'hilarious' novel,"Shannon Gibney, The Minnesota Star Tribune ""Little Movements"" Lauren Morrow's smart, incisive and hilarious debut, is an ode to the creative process and to people everywhere who feel the pull to take a risk and try something new. I have never read a book quite like this one, about the professional choreographic world, and featuring a deeply conflicted, 30-something, sardonic, Black female protagonist. It's been awhile since I enjoyed a book so much, and found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity and truth -- the truth of the absurdity -- in the world Morrow concocts. Dare I say this is an experience many readers need, especially right now? Layla Smart has been mostly happily married to an unsuccessful white screenwriter-turned-IT-guy in Brooklyn when she receives an offer for a residency at Briar House, an exclusive (and very white) dance center in rural Vermont. Although she and her husband Eli are nervous about being apart, they agree (at least on the surface) that she has to take it. People are also reading...

Here's why and what she plans to do Gunman in truck smashes into Michigan church and opens fire, killing 4, injuring 8 Once there, she meets Margot, the controlling artistic director of Briar House -- an older white woman who is at once overly invested in the success of Layla's work, and doggedly focused on its ""Black"" aspects. As the story and Layla's residency progress, we learn Briar House is not what it presents itself to be, and neither is Eli. ""There weren't many opportunities for escape in adulthood. That had been part of the appeal of Briar House, time away from everything,"" Layla says. ""I had felt like I'd figured out a loophole when I signed the paperwork. But now -- chilled to the bone, cheeks chapped, belly full, mind bent, heart broken -- Briar House felt like a disaster."" Layla is at times ambivalent about the role of her Blackness in her art. This is a topic I rarely see explored in fiction in such a nuanced way, reflecting the complexity of institutional investment in appearing ""anti-racist,"" how funding and opportunities are often tied to a certain performance of race, and the racial anxieties and contradictions these pressures exert on Black artists. After discovering the real reason she was awarded the residency, Layla muses, ""It was time to cleanse their palate with a Black artist. Something that spoke to the current moment. Now that Briar House had reached financial stability, they needed to show they were in step with the zeitgeist."" When the board is confronted with their negligence and racism, Morrow writes that they ""had nothing real to say. Harold apologized for the way everything had unfolded...They were all disappointed, but it had been a matter of Briar House surviving or not... But we should all rest assured -- the board planned to make a donation to the ACLU on behalf of the organization."" I cracked up when I read this, recognizing the tepid convictions most institutions espouse when they find themselves in a racist corner they cannot easily get out of. I imagine every Black and brown artist has experienced some version of this at some point in their career. In the end, this short, focused novel -- by a woman who used to do public relations for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater -- asks each of us to explore the artistic visions that may have eluded us, through the clouded view of our fears and attachments.

A fresh perspective: Spring 2025 interior design trends to refresh your home,"Spring is a season of renewal, a time when homes naturally shift from cosy hibernation zones to vibrant, light-filled spaces that echo the outdoors. This year's spring design trends celebrate ease, optimism, and a seamless connection between nature and modern living. ""Spring invites us to refresh, to pare back, and to bring joy into our spaces in ways that feel effortless yet intentional,"" says Cheryl Herweg, founder of Changing Spaces Interior Design. ""It's about creating rooms that feel alive, layered with natural textures, playful accents, and plenty of breathing space."" Bringing the outside in is more than a fad. Studies show that exposure to greenery indoors can reduce stress levels by up to 15%, while also improving productivity and mood. This season, think beyond the standard potted plant: vertical gardens, oversized planters, and floral-inspired textiles are all making their mark. Herweg suggests incorporating plants with sculptural leaves, such as monsteras or rubber trees, and pairing them with organic finishes like stone, wicker, or rattan for a grounded feel. Colour psychology identifies yellow as one of the most uplifting shades, often associated with increased energy and creativity. This spring, design palettes are leaning towards soft, sun-washed tones: buttery yellows, leafy greens, blush pinks, and sky blues. ""These colours bring an inherent lightness to a room,"" notes Herweg. ""Even small pops, a pastel-hued throw, painted accent wall, or ceramic vase, can instantly shift the mood from heavy to hopeful."" While bold maximalism has its place, there's a countermovement towards 'quiet luxury,' spaces that whisper rather than shout. This means investing in quality pieces with timeless appeal: a linen-upholstered sofa, an oak dining table, or artisanal ceramics. ""Spring is the perfect season to declutter,"" says Herweg. ""Focus on pieces that not only look beautiful but feel good to use every day. It's about curating joy through design."" With warmer weather, South Africans are embracing living areas that spill into patios and gardens. Sliding glass doors, outdoor rugs, and weather-resistant fabrics are blurring the lines between indoor comfort and outdoor living. Adding soft lighting, such as lanterns, fairy lights, or sculptural lamps, helps extend the evenings outdoors, creating spaces that feel both inviting and practical. Spring also marks a return to playfulness. Expect bold stripes, organic florals, and tactile layering across cushions, throws, and rugs. Mixing old and new, vintage ceramics alongside sleek contemporary furniture, creates character without feeling contrived. Herweg emphasises balance: ""It's not about chasing trends, but about weaving personality into your space. Spring gives us the freedom to experiment, to try that patterned wallpaper or sculptural lamp that sparks joy.""

"ATAF backs Nigeria's tax reforms, pledges technical support - The Nation Newspaper","The African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) has declared support for Nigeria's new tax laws, describing them as vital for economic growth and sustainable development across the continent. In a statement issued by Dare Adekanmbi, Special Adviser on Media to the Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Dr. Zacch Adedeji, ATAF pledged technical assistance to ensure Nigeria reaps the benefits of its tax reforms. The Executive Secretary of ATAF, Ms. Mary Baine, who assumed office recently, made this known during a courtesy visit to the FIRS chairman in Abuja on Tuesday. Baine recalled ATAF's intervention in Zambia's mining sector, where the organisation helped the country improve its capacity to generate revenue. She assured that Nigeria could expect similar support in key sectors of its economy. ""When you look at the strategic vision of FIRS, we see the things you are doing and the way you're changing the tax system, the kind of reforms and the time that it has taken and of course the movement forward. ""So, we applaud you, and I wanted to say that ATAF is here to say that we stand with you, we applaud you, and we're ready to provide whatever support that could lead to its success. ""In terms of your strategic vision -- people, technology and data -- we find that this is something that is really critical for the rest of the continent and that it is an area where ATAF will be happy to support as well,"" she said. Baine also said ATAF would leverage Nigeria's influence on the continent and beyond to mobilise other member countries towards strengthening the organisation's work. In his remarks, Adedeji praised Baine's leadership qualities and expressed optimism that her tenure would advance the forum's objectives. He urged African countries to devise their own solutions to pressing challenges rather than rely on external assistance. ""My belief has always been that solutions to Africa's challenges can only come from Africa. There is no free lunch anywhere. I have said that I don't believe in aids; I believe in cooperation. ""There is a saying that when you are not on the table, you are definitely on the menu. So, Africa must be on the table and that is it. We should stop being on the menu. That is my charge to you. ""So, the expectation from us as a continent is also to bring what we can contribute to the work, most especially in tax matters. For us, we have to evolve our own fiscal policies which are what Nigeria has done with the new tax laws,"" he stated. Adedeji noted that Nigeria's new tax regime replaced colonial-era legislation that had long outlived its relevance. ""Before now, we had tax laws that were colonial relics. We had the Stamp Duties Act of 1939 which was enacted when there was no internet,"" he added. The new tax laws, he explained, were crafted to align with Nigeria's current realities and position the economy for sustainable growth.","Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",2025-10-01T09:17:06Z,https://thenationonlineng.net/ataf-backs-nigerias-tax-reforms-pledges-technical-support-2/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.229012,0.5372549019607844
"Visit Qatar And Qatar Airways Spotlight Tourism At Kuwait Roadshow With Stopovers, Winter Holidays And Leisure Packages - Travel And Tour World","Visit Qatar, in collaboration with Qatar Airways and organised by Go Beyond, took significant steps toward strengthening regional tourism outreach by hosting a dedicated Kuwait Roadshow on September 24, 2025. The event, held at the prestigious Four Seasons Hotel in Kuwait City, was strategically designed to highlight Qatar's evolving position as a dynamic tourism hub in the Middle East. As part of an ongoing marketing initiative, the roadshow brought together key players from the travel and hospitality sectors and created opportunities for B2B networking. By fostering collaborations with more than 100 leading travel trade professionals and tour operators from Kuwait, the initiative reaffirmed Qatar's growing importance in regional tourism and placed emphasis on the country's diverse tourism offerings, from winter retreats to stopover holidays. The Kuwait Roadshow was curated with the goal of elevating Qatar's visibility in a neighboring market. By working closely with established Kuwaiti travel agencies, the initiative encouraged local tour operators to integrate Qatar into their tour packages and itineraries. Hotels and Destination Management Companies (DMCs) from Qatar actively engaged in discussions with their Kuwaiti counterparts, enhancing opportunities for extended collaboration. This outreach was carefully positioned to strengthen partnerships that go beyond short-term campaigns. It emphasized Qatar's strategic role in the Gulf region, serving as a gateway for both leisure and stopover travelers. Through cooperative marketing efforts and strong business-to-business connections, Qatar continues to position itself as an appealing short-haul destination, particularly attractive to families, couples, and luxury travelers based in Kuwait. During the event, participants were introduced to Qatar's broad spectrum of travel experiences. These included quick getaways tailored for weekend visitors, winter vacation packages enriched with cultural and festive experiences, and the country's increasingly popular stopover programs designed for transit passengers using Qatar Airways. Stopovers, supported strongly by Qatar Airways' global network, have emerged as a vital tourism pillar. They allow international travelers flying through Doha to experience a curated taste of Qatar, from its iconic Corniche skyline to desert excursions and cultural heritage experiences at Msheireb and Souq Waqif. This seamless connection between air travel and tourism demonstrates the synergy between Qatar Airways and Visit Qatar. The Kuwait Roadshow was an extension of Qatar's ambition to underline its tourism strengths and highlight its unique blend of modern attractions and cultural legacy. With the FIFA World Cup 2022 having put Qatar on the global map, initiatives like these serve as follow-up campaigns to sustain international attention and transform short-term sporting exposure into long-term tourism growth. Qatar has steadily cultivated a reputation for providing high-quality hospitality and luxury experiences, backed by modern infrastructure, world-class hotels, and cultural districts. As a regional tourism hub, the country seeks to tap into diverse markets across the Gulf while connecting with global travelers through its flagship airline. A central pillar of the event was the alignment with the Qatar National Tourism Strategy 2030, which provides clear direction on how the country seeks to integrate tourism into its future economic plans. The strategy has its foundations in three core goals: strengthening destination awareness, encouraging seasonal travel across different times of the year, and contributing to Qatar's economic diversification. By spotlighting upcoming events, luxury offerings, and seasonal experiences at the Kuwait Roadshow, Visit Qatar reaffirmed its commitment to advancing the objectives of the strategy. The roadshow demonstrated how outreach to neighboring countries can be a vital step in fostering continuous growth and creating an interconnected tourism ecosystem that benefits both visitors and local businesses. The networking sessions formed the heart of the roadshow's success. Representatives from Qatari hotels engaged directly with Kuwaiti agencies, showcasing package deals, unique experiences, and tailored offerings that appeal to diverse traveler interests. This exchange ensured that Kuwaiti travel planners could design high-quality itineraries featuring Qatar as a prominent option, whether for planned vacations, short leisure holidays, or aspirational stopovers. The format forged dialogue that not only promoted existing partnerships but also opened doors for future collaborations in marketing, product development, and cultural exchange initiatives. For Kuwaiti tour operators, direct engagement with Qatari tourism partners brought clarity and confidence in promoting Qatar as a premium Gulf destination to their clients. One of the key talking points during the event was Qatar's potential to provide a year-round calendar of tourism activities. As a destination, Qatar has successfully balanced heritage with modernity, offering desert adventures and beach getaways alongside luxury shopping, gourmet dining, and seasonal cultural festivals. Winter vacations emerged as a particularly strong proposition, tapping into Kuwait's regional demand for quick holiday escapes during cooler months. Beyond leisure, visitors were encouraged to view Qatar as a practical stopover before longer intercontinental journeys, particularly given Qatar Airways' extensive global network. This blend of leisure, convenience, and cultural storytelling marked Qatar's presentation as a holistic destination capable of serving multiple travel purposes simultaneously. The regional tourism landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with several Gulf states investing heavily in hospitality and visitor experiences. Qatar's strategic outlook, however, has relied on a combination of luxury, accessibility, and cultural authenticity to stand apart. Initiatives like the Kuwait Roadshow provide a platform to directly engage with neighboring markets where travel decisions are often based on familiarity and trust. By showcasing its expanding leisure portfolio, Visit Qatar emphasized not only the quality of visitor attractions but also the convenience of accessing them through Doha as a well-connected hub. This mix underscores Qatar's unique identity in the Gulf tourism market. The Kuwait Roadshow has highlighted how strategic engagement, targeted partnerships, and curated tourism offerings can contribute to long-term sustainability for Qatar's tourism industry. By balancing international promotion with regional outreach, Visit Qatar is shaping a holistic model that contributes actively to the objectives of economic diversification and national development. From strengthening links with tour operators and supporting business networks to highlighting seasonal travel opportunities, the initiative served as a strong example of how tourism marketing can foster mutual benefits. The active participation of over 100 professionals underlined Qatar's credibility and ensured the roadshow left a lasting impression on the Kuwaiti travel trade.",Travel And Tour World,2025-10-01T09:12:03Z,https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/visit-qatar-and-qatar-airways-spotlight-tourism-at-kuwait-roadshow-with-stopovers-winter-holidays-and-leisure-packages/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.229558,0.4901960784313726

Inflation rise throws future interest rate cuts in doubt,"Euro zone inflation accelerated last month on higher services prices and a smaller decline in energy costs, likely reinforcing bets on the ECB keeping interest rates on hold for some time. Inflation in the 20 nations sharing the euro picked up to 2.2pc in September from 2.0pc in August, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll of economists. A more closely watched core figure, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, meanwhile held steady at 2.3pc, despite a pick up in services inflation, fresh data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday. Although the European Central Bank spent the past four years battling excessive inflation, this uptick is unlikely to fuel too many concerns among its policymakers, as broader economic trends suggest this is a temporary blip and numbers could soon head back to, then below, the ECB's 2pc target. ""As we can model the future, the risks to inflation appear quite contained in both directions,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday. ""With policy rates now at 2pc, we are well placed to respond if the risks to inflation shift, or if new shocks emerge that threaten our target."" Still, some policymakers are likely to use the September figure as an argument against easing rates further and the bank is almost certain to keep rates on hold for the third straight meeting on Oct 30. Financial investors are so comfortable with this outlook, they price just a 10pc chance of another rate cut later this year and see only a 30pc chance of a cut by the middle of 2026. Instead of fearing a new bout of runaway prices, some ECB policymakers actually worry about inflation going too low. The bank sees the rate dipping to 1.7pc next year and holding below target for six straight quarters, a period long enough for retailers and employers to change their own pricing and wage-setting behaviour. If this happened, some policymakers argue, low price growth could get entrenched, much like in the pre-pandemic decade, when the ECB was unable to get back to target, despite cutting rates below zero and printing trillions of euros to stimulate growth. Their argument is bolstered by weak figures for industry, investment and household consumption, which all point to a further slowdown for an economy also hamstrung by U.S. tariffs. The more hawkish camp at the ECB, which appears to have the majority for now, argues that the undershooting risk is contained as the economy is proving resilient to trade strife, industry is rebounding, employment is solid and increased defence spending will bolster growth. It will take time for the picture to clear up, suggesting that the ECB will wait before moving rates once again after it cut them by 2 full percentage points in the year to June.",Irish Independent,2025-10-01T09:16:34Z,https://www.independent.ie/business/inflation-rise-throws-future-interest-rate-cuts-in-doubt/a1654691501.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.230074,0.1372549019607843
S&P Global: Επιβράδυνε η ανάπτυξη του ελληνικού μεταποιητικού τομέα τον Σεπτέμβριο - BusinessNews.gr,"Παρ' όλα αυτά, οι ρυθμοί αύξησης παρέμειναν σε ιστορικά υψηλά επίπεδα λόγω της συνεχιζόμενης βελτίωσης της συνολικής ζήτησης. Η επιχειρηματική εμπιστοσύνη αυξήθηκε, λόγω των προσδοκιών για ισχυρότερες πωλήσεις κατά τους επόμενους μήνες. Οι λειτουργικές συνθήκες σε όλο το εύρος του ελληνικού τομέα μεταποίησης εξακολούθησαν να βελτιώνονται στο τέλος του τρίτου τριμήνου, σύμφωνα με τα τελευταία στοιχεία του δείκτη PMI της S&P Global. Ωστόσο, η συνολική ανάπτυξη εξασθένησε σε σύγκριση με τον Αύγουστο, λόγω της βραδύτερης αύξησης της παραγωγής, των νέων παραγγελιών και της απασχόλησης. Παρ' όλα αυτά, οι ρυθμοί αύξησης παρέμειναν σε ιστορικά υψηλά επίπεδα λόγω της συνεχιζόμενης βελτίωσης της συνολικής ζήτησης. Η αύξηση του αριθμού του προσωπικού και των αγορών εισροών επέτρεψε στις εταιρείες να διαχειριστούν αποτελεσματικά τον φόρτο εργασίας τους, καθώς ο όγκος αδιεκπεραίωτων εργασιών μειώθηκε σημαντικά. Εν τω μεταξύ, η επιχειρηματική εμπιστοσύνη αυξήθηκε, λόγω των προσδοκιών για ισχυρότερες πωλήσεις κατά τους επόμενους μήνες. Σύμφωνα με τα αποτελέσματα της έρευνας, ο ρυθμός αύξησης του κόστους υποχώρησε στον βραδύτερο που έχει καταγραφεί από τον Νοέμβριο του 2023, παρά τη συνεχιζόμενη ζήτηση για εισροές. Παρότι οι εταιρείες προσπάθησαν να κάνουν απόσβεση των δαπανών μέσω της αύξησης των δικών τους τιμών πώλησης, ο ανταγωνισμός περιόρισε την τιμολογιακή τους ισχύ. Κλείνοντας στις 52.0 μονάδες τον Σεπτέμβριο, ο εποχικά προσαρμοσμένος Δείκτης Υπευθύνων Προμηθειών της S&P Global για τον τομέα μεταποίησης στην Ελλάδα (Purchasing Managers' Index™ - PMI) υποχώρησε από τις 54.5 μονάδες του Αυγούστου. Τα τελευταία στοιχεία υπέδειξαν μέτρια ανάκαμψη της υγείας του τομέα, μολονότι ήταν η δεύτερη βραδύτερη σε διάστημα δέκα μηνών (η πρώτη ήταν τον Ιούλιο του 2025). Εντούτοις, ο ρυθμός αύξησης κινήθηκε σε επίπεδα υψηλότερα από τον μακροχρόνιο μέσο όρο της έρευνας (50.4 μονάδες). Η ασθενέστερη αύξηση των νέων παραγγελιών στο τέλος του τρίτου τριμήνου παρεμπόδισε τον συνολικό ρυθμό ανάπτυξης. Παρ' όλα αυτά, μέλη του πάνελ ανέφεραν συνεχιζόμενη ζήτηση και απόκτηση νέων πελατών, καθώς οι νέες πωλήσεις αυξήθηκαν μέτρια. Οι νέες εργασίες αυξήθηκαν για ενδέκατο συνεχή μήνα, παρότι ο ρυθμός ανάπτυξης ήταν ο ασθενέστερος που έχει καταγραφεί από τον Φεβρουάριο. Ωστόσο, οι βελτιώσεις στις πωλήσεις επικεντρώθηκαν στις αγορές του εσωτερικού, καθώς οι νέες παραγγελίες εξαγωγών μειώθηκαν για πέμπτο συνεχή μήνα. Ο ρυθμός συρρίκνωσης επιταχύνθηκε και ήταν ο ταχύτερος που έχει καταγραφεί από τον Δεκέμβριο του 2022 λόγω του υποτονικού κλίματος διεθνούς ζήτησης. Η μεγαλύτερη εισροή νέων παραγγελιών ώθησε τη νέα αύξηση των επιπέδων παραγωγής κατά τη διάρκεια του Σεπτεμβρίου. Οι Έλληνες κατασκευαστές ανέφεραν επίσης ότι οι βελτιώσεις στην παραγωγικότητα ενίσχυσαν την παραγωγή. Ο ρυθμός αύξησης ήταν ο δεύτερος βραδύτερος που έχει καταγραφεί σε διάστημα δέκα μηνών (ο πρώτος ήταν τον Ιούλιο του 2025). Εν τω μεταξύ, σύμφωνα με αναφορές, οι υψηλότερες τιμές από την πλευρά των προμηθευτών οδήγησαν σε νέα αύξηση του κόστους εισροών για τους παραγωγούς αγαθών. Παρ' όλα αυτά, ο ρυθμός αύξησης υποχώρησε στον ασθενέστερο που έχει καταγραφεί σε διάστημα περίπου δύο ετών, με βάση αναφορές για εκπτώσεις από τους προμηθευτές σε είδη όπως τα πολυμερή και συναφή υλικά. Οι κατασκευαστές κατέγραψαν επίσης ηπιότερη -αν και ιστορικά υψηλή- αύξηση των χρεώσεων εκροών στο τέλος του τρίτου τριμήνου. Ο ρυθμός αύξησης των τιμών πώλησης ήταν μεταξύ των βραδύτερων που έχουν καταγραφεί σε διάστημα ενός έτους περίπου, καθώς οι εταιρείες προσπάθησαν να παραμείνουν ανταγωνιστικές. Οι Έλληνες κατασκευαστές εξακολούθησαν να προσλαμβάνουν επιπλέον προσωπικό τον Σεπτέμβριο, καθώς ο ρυθμός δημιουργίας θέσεων εργασίας εξασθένησε ελαφρώς από το υψηλό τριών μηνών του Αυγούστου. Σύμφωνα με αναφορές, ο μεγαλύτερος φόρτος εργασίας συνέτεινε στην πρόσληψη προσωπικού πλήρους απασχόλησης, καθώς οι εταιρείες κατάφεραν κατ' αυτόν τον τρόπο να μειώσουν σημαντικά τον όγκο αδιεκπεραίωτων εργασιών. Οι νέες, πιο αισιόδοξες προοπτικές ως προς την παραγωγή κατά το επόμενο έτος συνέβαλαν στην αύξηση της απασχόλησης. Ο βαθμός αισιοδοξίας αυξήθηκε στον ισχυρότερο που έχει καταγραφεί από τον Ιούνιο, λόγω της αυξημένης δραστηριότητας στον τομέα κατασκευών και ακινήτων και της ελπίδας για ευνοϊκότερες χρηματοοικονομικές συνθήκες. Παράλληλα, η ζήτηση για εισροές διατηρήθηκε από την πλευρά των παραγωγών αγαθών, καθώς η αγοραστική δραστηριότητα αυξήθηκε με έντονο ρυθμό. Οι εταιρείες ανέφεραν ότι στην άνοδο οδήγησαν οι μεγαλύτερες απαιτήσεις παραγωγής, άνοδος η οποία εξασθένησε ελαφρώς σε σύγκριση με την αντίστοιχη του Αυγούστου. Ωστόσο, τον Σεπτέμβριο καταγράφηκαν περαιτέρω καθυστερήσεις στους χρόνους παράδοσης προμηθειών . Σύμφωνα με αναφορές μελών του πάνελ, οι αλλαγές στις μεταφορές και στα τελωνεία οδήγησαν σε μεγαλύτερους χρόνους παράδοσης υλικών. Παρότι έντονος, ο βαθμός στον οποίο μειώθηκε η απόδοση των προμηθευτών ήταν ο λιγότερος σημαντικός που έχει καταγραφεί σε διάστημα τριών μηνών. Τέλος, οι παραγωγοί αγαθών κατέγραψαν εντονότερες συρρικνώσεις στα αποθέματα τόσο των προμηθειών όσο και των ετοίμων προϊόντων κατά τη διάρκεια του Σεπτεμβρίου. Σύμφωνα με αναφορές, οι μειώσεις στα τρέχοντα αποθέματα οφείλονταν σε πωλήσεις που πραγματοποιήθηκαν απευθείας από τα αποθέματα, στη χρήση των αποθηκευμένων εισροών για τη διευκόλυνση των απαιτήσεων των νέων παραγγελιών και στις δυσκολίες αναπλήρωσης των αποθεμάτων. O Siân Jones, Επικεφαλής Οικονομολόγος της S&P Global Market Intelligence σχολίασε: ""Ο ελληνικός τομέας μεταποίησης παρέμεινε ένα θετικό σημείο στην Ευρωζώνη, καθώς η παραγωγή και οι νέες παραγγελίες υπέδειξαν συνεχιζόμενες αυξήσεις στο τέλος του τρίτου τριμήνου. Οι ρυθμοί αύξησης υποχώρησαν, ωστόσο συνέχισαν να ωθούν τα μεγαλύτερα επίπεδα απασχόλησης και αγορών εισροών. Παρά τις επανειλημμένες διαταραχές στην αλυσίδα εφοδιασμού και την έντονη ζήτηση για εισροές, οι πιέσεις επί του κόστους υποχώρησαν περαιτέρω. Οι ασθενέστερες αυξήσεις στις τιμές των προμηθευτών έδωσαν τη δυνατότητα στις εταιρείες να προσαρμόσουν τις τιμές τους ώστε να είναι πιο ανταγωνιστικές, καθώς επιβραδύνθηκε επίσης η αύξηση των χρεώσεων εκροών. Εντούτοις, οι τιμές πώλησης εξακολούθησαν να αυξάνονται με ιστορικά υψηλό ρυθμό σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία του δείκτη PMI, δεδομένου ότι, με βάση τις τρέχουσες προβλέψεις της S&P Global Market Intelligence, ο ελληνικός ΔΤΚ (Δείκτης Τιμών Καταναλωτή) θα αυξηθεί κατά 3.1% το 2025, υπερβαίνοντας τον στόχο του 2% της Ευρωπαϊκής Κεντρικής Τράπεζας για την ευρύτερη Ευρωζώνη.""",businessnews.gr,2025-10-01T09:07:00Z,https://www.businessnews.gr/oikonomia/item/319939-s-p-global-epivradyne-i-anaptyksi-tou-ellinikoy-metapoiitikoy-tomea-ton-septemvrio,2025-10-01 17:26:57.230615,
Commercial break: Florida's business rent tax sunsets for good,"Florida has stood alone for years as the only state charging a business rent tax. But that ended Wednesday morning as a tax reform package went into effect. After years of slow chipping at the unpopular tax, the Republican-controlled Legislature voted to phase it out completely. It was a move celebrated by business advocates who long argued Florida made itself less attractive to businesses by collecting the levy on commercial leases. ""The elimination of Florida's business rent tax is a major victory for employers across the state,"" said Brewster Bevis, Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO. ""Beginning October 1, businesses will no longer shoulder this uniquely burdensome tax. Repealing it permanently delivers $1.6 billion in savings that can instead be reinvested into jobs, growth and Florida's economy."" But that means governments throughout Florida will also lose that much revenue -- and then some. Jeff Scala, a lobbyist with the Florida Association of Counties, took issue with the Legislature imposing the consequence of killing that tax on local governments. He said county governments have supported eliminating the tax but wanted to retain local sales taxes, most of which were approved by voter referendums, on business rents. The Legislature's tax relief plan limits local governments' ability to collect that. ""This measure will impact not only local revenue sharing but will also significantly affect revenues anticipated from the collection of local option sales taxes,"" Scala said in a wrap-up webinar after the close of Session. The reason for the concern is that the rent tax -- unlike property taxes assessed against the appraised value of land -- is technically itself a sales tax on rent. In counties that have approved other sales taxes -- school penny taxes, for example -- the local option tax has been charged in addition to the business rent tax. But without the rent tax charged in the first place, the other sales taxes won't be added on. That means savings -- and revenue losses -- far beyond the $1.6 billion collected in the business rent tax. Still, Florida's stand-alone status has put the tax in crosshairs for decades. First imposed in 1969, lawmakers have taken steps to phase out the tax, sometimes replacing the revenue source as it did with approval of online sales tax collection in 2021. The issue has been especially troublesome in North Florida counties, where economic development officials are often competing with the rent tax-free business climate in other states. Rep. Wyman Duggan, a Jacksonville Republican who chaired the House Ways and Means Committee this year, said the commercial real estate industry in Northeast Florida has been deeply concerned with the tax for at least 15 years. ""We are competing with Georgia and Alabama for businesses to expand and relocate,"" he said. ""If a business is leasing space, Georgia could try and use absence inducement to locate in Georgia rather than Florida. So we are saying Florida has no income tax and a low regulatory environment, but Georgia then comes and says, you are paying less every month because of this tax on commercial leases so just move to Kingston."" And even after tense communication between the Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, the Republican Governor voiced enthusiasm about killing the business rent tax when he signed the budget. ""The Legislature has also done something that I've been asking for many years, and that's eliminating a tax that only Florida has, of all 50 states, and that's taxing business rent,"" DeSantis said. ""It's not good for our economy. It's not good for business growth. And so that tax is being sunsetted. How many times do you hear governments eliminating a tax?"" But some lawmakers remain concerned about whether the drive to cut more taxes each year has its own cost on the attractiveness to live and work in Florida. The state is also considering whether to slash sales taxes or to eliminate property tax altogether. ""It's important government not get involved in controlling our speech and freedoms, but the government should be there as an asset and vessel for success. But we don't have resources to do that,"" said Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat. ""I look at our budget, and we may not have deficits. But we are one of the most economically constrained states in the country, and that shows up in low teacher pay, in heavy traffic, in neighborhoods getting flooded that shouldn't get flooded. All these things are measures of quality of life, and those deficits still matter."" Still, even those reluctant to make broad tax cuts would not defend the business rent tax, a toll hated by small and large businesses alike. Several Democrats voted against the tax reform package but pointed to other issues like a tax holiday on firearms and ammunition. Eskamani said she would have supported the tax cut package if it simply eliminated the business rent tax. The same goes for Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, a Parkland Democrat in line to lead the Democratic caucus after the 2026 election cycle. ""I've always supported getting rid of business rent tax,"" Hunschofsky said. ""It's more de facto sales tax."" Small-business owners have opposed the tax for years, she said, and with economic uncertainty on the horizon, she voices support for easing a financial burden.",Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

"US Gold Reserves Shatter $1,000,000,000,000 As Precious Metal Climbs to New Record Highs: Report - The Daily Hodl","The value of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's gold holdings passed $1 trillion on Monday as gold prices continue to climb. Data from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service indicates the Treasury Department holds 261,498,926.241 fine troy ounces of gold. Gold is trading at $3,865.43 per ounce at time of writing, according to data from Goldprice.org. The precious metal is up nearly 8.5% in the past 30 days, 23% in the past six months and 44% in the past year. Colin R. Weiss, a Federal Reserve economist, explains in a note published in August that the US gold reserves are valued at a statutory price of $42.22, which was set by a 1973 law. At that statutory price, the Treasury Department's gold holdings are only valued at around $11 billion. Weiss notes that some governments have recently explored using proceeds from valuation gains on gold reserves as a way to finance additional expenditures without increasing debt or raising taxes. He outlines five countries that have done so in the past 30 years, though he acknowledges that the results have been mixed. ""Central banks have used revaluation proceeds to offset operating losses and maintain net profits or minimize reported net losses. In Italy, revaluation proceeds covered a one-off loss for the conversion of a specific bond the Banca d'Italia owned. In Curacao and Saint Martin, the proceeds covered losses generated by a fall in interest income from holding relatively lower-yielding securities than previous years and realized valuation losses as the central bank rebalanced its portfolio. The use of revaluation proceeds temporarily boosted profits for both central banks, but, in Curacao and Saint Martin, the use was paired with other measures to [generate] additional income on a sustained basis.",The Daily Hodl,2025-10-01T09:17:37Z,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/10/01/us-gold-reserves-shatter-1000000000000-as-precious-metal-climbs-to-new-record-highs-report/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.231385,0.2156862745098038

Telecom Industry Welcomes CCP's Approval of Telenor-Ufone Merger,"Pakistan's telecom sector has welcomed the Competition Commission of Pakistan's (CCP) approval of the long-awaited merger between Ufone and Telenor Pakistan, calling it a step towards a more sustainable and efficient industry. Industry leaders say the move could help telecom companies focus on expanding services, rather than spending resources on maintaining separate networks. Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz, congratulated PTCL on receiving the green light from the CCP. He said, ""Consolidation can make the telecom industry more sustainable by ensuring resources are invested in expanding services rather than duplicating networks. Now the real priority should be timely spectrum release, which is essential to unlock Pakistan's digital growth and ensure that millions of people benefit from faster, more affordable connectivity."" Telenor Asia also expressed appreciation for the CCP's careful review before granting approval. In a statement, the company said, We believe this transaction would strengthen Pakistan's telecoms sector. This CCP approval is a significant milestone in the process, which will now move forward for approval by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). We look forward to the timely approval process and final completion of the transaction soon. Telenor Pakistan will continue its business as usual, focusing on delivering services to its 43 million customer base."" The merger is one of the most significant changes in Pakistan's telecom landscape in over a decade. For years, four national mobile operators competed for market share. With this deal, the number will shrink to three. Experts say this could lead to stronger networks and better service, but also warn that fewer operators might mean less choice and potentially higher prices for consumers. The CCP's approval comes with a set of conditions designed to protect competition and ensure that customers and rival operators are not disadvantaged. The industry now awaits the next steps, including approval from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.",ProPakistani,2025-10-01T09:10:05Z,https://propakistani.pk/?p=931509,2025-10-01 17:26:57.231669,0.4823529411764707

National Sheep and Goat Breeders' Association Declares Protest Readiness over Lack of Livestock Vaccination,"The National Sheep and Goat Breeders' Association (NOKA) has announced protest readiness, giving the Minister of Agriculture and Food, Georgi Tahov, a deadline of Monday, October 7, to make an immediate decision on vaccination against sheep and goat pox. If no decision is made, a national protest is scheduled for October 10, according to a statement from the organization received by BTA Wednesday. ""If such a decision is not made, NOKA will welcome Commissioner Hansen with blocked roads and burning coffins,"" the statement said. EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Food, Christophe Hansen, is expected in Bulgaria on October 9-10 to participate in discussions on the Common Agricultural Policy 2028-2034. The decision to declare protest readiness was unanimously approved by NOKA's Management Board during an extraordinary meeting. According to the association, some farmers have already vaccinated more than 30,000 sheep, others are hesitant due to concerns about milk prices, and the majority, waiting for state-led vaccination, are losing animals, income, and hope. NOKA's other demands include recalculation and payment of adequate compensation to all affected farmers, declaration of force majeure for sheep and goat owners regarding limited measures under Campaign 2025, and tax exemptions for 2025 and 2026 for owners of euthanized animals.

Tinubu reimagines Nigeria's infrastructure landscape - The Nation Newspaper,"From the time President Bola Ahmed Tinubu assumed office in 2023; his administration has laid much emphasis on infrastructural renewal. In two years, his administration has committed resources to roads, bridges, rail, ports, airports and power; signalling a determination to move beyond a past marked by stalled projects and unmet promises. writes that the effort is aimed at reconnecting the country's regions and laying firmer foundations for economic growth Since he assumed office on May 29, 2023, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has placed infrastructure at the centre of his administration's Renewed Hope Agenda. In two years, his administration has committed resources to roads, bridges, rail, ports, airports and power; signalling a determination to move beyond a past marked by stalled projects and unmet promises. The effort is aimed at reconnecting the country's regions and laying firmer foundations for economic growth. The Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway, stretching 700 kilometres across nine states, captures the scale and audacity of this ambition. With N15 trillion committed and the first 30 kilometres inaugurated in Lagos in May 2025, it is designed not merely as a road but as a new backbone for commerce, tourism and coastal development. Yet, it is only the flagship of a broader drive. From the near-complete Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the advancing Abuja-Kano dual carriageway to resurgent ports and a power sector that, in 2025 achieved record generation, the government is rewriting the story of national infrastructure. Roads and bridges reconnecting a nation Nowhere is this transformation more visible than on Nigeria's roads. The Federal Ministry of Works reports that over N2.2 trillion has been invested in road projects since May 2023, with 440 projects ongoing, 260 palliative works completed, and 29 legacy initiatives have been undertaken. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, a 127-kilometre corridor central to Nigeria's road network, is now between 90 and 92 per cent complete as of September 2025. When the Tinubu administration took office in May 2023, the project, first awarded in 2013, stood at roughly 70 to 75 per cent, with major sections of the Lagos-Sagamu axis still under reconstruction. Since then, progress has accelerated under a tighter funding schedule and closer supervision by the Federal Ministry of Works. Currently, all main carriageways are fully open, cutting average travel time from three to four hours down to roughly two to two-and-a-half hours, a reduction of up to 35 per cent. What remains are about 10 to 15 kilometres of service lanes, four to five pedestrian bridges, toll plazas, street lighting and landscaping, with final delivery targeted for the first quarter of 2026. The Abuja-Kano dual carriageway, covering 375 kilometres, is 65 to 70 per cent complete. Section 2 (Kaduna-Zaria, 73 km) is fully operational, Section 3 (Zaria-Kano, 137 km) is nearing 90 per cent, while Section 1 (Abuja-Kaduna, 165 km) is 30 per cent complete. During his September 2025 inspection, the Minister of Works, David Umahi, assured Nigerians that ""the progress is steady, and this road will soon match international standards."" In the East, the Enugu-Port Harcourt dual carriageway (190 km) is 75 to 80 per cent delivered, with the Umuahia-Aba section opened in June 2025 and the Enugu-bound section scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2026. The Lokoja-Benin corridor (253 km), re-launched in February 2025 with N305 billion, has reached between 60 to 65 per cent completion, while the Kano-Maiduguri Road (540 km), long delayed, is now over 55 per cent, with key sections projected for completion in 2028. Landmark bridges have also featured prominently. The Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos underwent emergency repairs from November 2023 to April 2024 at a cost of N21 billion. In August 2025, a N3.8 trillion structural overhaul began, with Section 1 targeted for completion in mid-2026. The Second Niger Bridge, inaugurated in May 2023, had its access roads flagged off in March 2025 to ease connectivity between Anambra and Delta states. Across the Southeast, projects such as the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, the Abakpa Flyover and Akpoha Bridge are in various stages of rehabilitation. Rail: Linking regions by steel Nigeria's rail development has gathered pace under the Renewed Hope Agenda. The Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Railway (157 km), operational since 2021, continues to expand freight capacity, with the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) and APM Terminals flagging off a new container service from Apapa Port to the Moniya Freight Yard in Ibadan in February 2025. The cargo trains, running three times a week, can haul up to 35 wagons of 40-foot containers or 70 wagons of 20-foot containers; a development which NRC Managing Director, Dr. Kayode Opeifa said would ""enhance import and export activities, providing a more efficient and convenient mode of transportation."" In 2024 alone, NRC recorded 362,327 tons of containerised freight moved via both narrow and standard gauge systems. This underscores the sector's renewed momentum. Alongside this, the Abuja-Kaduna line has undergone track doubling and signal upgrades since 2024. The $1.8 billion Kano-Maradi Line (284 km) is 60 per cent complete with the Kano-Daura section targeting 2026 delivery timeline, while rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Rail Line (1,400 km) has accelerated since 2023, with Sections I-IV aiming for a 2028 finish. In August 2025, the Federal Government announced a proposal for a high-speed rail network connecting Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt covering over 2,500 kilometres, with $60 billion in funding discussions led by the Asian Development Bank. Reforms in the maritime sector have doubled port revenues from N424.2 billion in 2023 to N893.6 billion in 2024. The Tin Can Island Port Complex is undergoing a $1 billion reconstruction to integrate with Apapa and Lekki ports, while Onne, Calabar and Warri ports are being modernised. At the inauguration of the Lekki Deep Sea Port Access Road in May 2025, President Tinubu declared: ""We are changing the story of infrastructure development in Nigeria through the execution of tangible projects across the country."" The port, with a capacity of 2.7 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) is positioned as a central hub for West African trade. Kano and Kaduna inland ports also resumed operations in 2025, easing trade for the northern region. The Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola affirmed in May 2025 that ""Nigeria's seaports have been repositioned as engines of economic growth."" The power sector has seen notable progress. In March 2025, generation peaked at 5,713 megawatts. The Presidential Power Initiative with Siemens has added over 700 megawatts since 2023, targeting 4,000MW by 2026. The N700 billion Presidential Metering Initiative; delivered 300,000 smart meters by 2025, with World Bank support, while the African Development Bank committed $1.1 billion to off-grid electrification in Northeast; targeting five million new connections by 2026. The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu said in April 2025: ""This government has brought renewed clarity, vigour and urgency to power sector transformation."" Airports: Modernising gateways Airports have also been prioritised for modernisation. The Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA, Lagos) inaugurated its domestic terminal in 2023 and began $500 million rehabilitation in July 2025 under a 10-year concession, targeting 2027 completion. In Abuja, work has progressed on the second runway of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, backed by N10 billion in federal allocations. Upgrades are ongoing at Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, Maiduguri, and Benin airports, covering runway works, terminals and utilities. Agriculture: Mechanisation infrastructure In June 2025, President Tinubu launched the Renewed Hope Agricultural Mechanisation Programme with 2,000 tractors, 10 combine harvesters, 12 mobile workshops and 9,000 implements supplied under the Belarus partnership. The initiative, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, is designed to cultivate over 550,000 hectares, generate two million metric tons of food and create 16,000 jobs. The tractors will be distributed through a service provider model to ensure smallholder farmers gain access, while workshops and spare part depots are being set up as supporting infrastructure. Looking ahead The administration recognises the hurdles. Funding gaps, security concerns and the challenge of maintaining new infrastructure continue to shadow progress. Yet, the political will behind the Renewed Hope Agenda has given momentum to projects that once languished. As President Tinubu declared in September 2025, ""infrastructure projects will cover all regions, as no Nigerian is second-class and no region is left behind."" From the concrete pavement of highways to the cranes reshaping seaports and the new sub-stations lighting up communities, Nigeria is on the path of renewal. The journey remains long, but the foundation for a modern infrastructure landscape is being laid steadily and in some cases, audaciously.","Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics",2025-10-01T04:39:00Z,https://thenationonlineng.net/tinubu-reimagines-nigerias-infrastructure-landscape/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.232690,0.2941176470588236

ESAB Enhances Rogue Stick and Tig Inverters with New Functionality,"All ESAB Rogue Stick and TIG welders have been enhanced with a pulsed Stick output that offers more control over heat input and reduces spatter.(Credit: ESAB) Fabrication technology specialist ESAB has enhanced its Rogue ES and ET line of inverters by adding DC Pulsed Stick welding functionality to all three models in the series. The models that received the upgrade include Rogue ES 151iP PRO and Rogue ES 201iP PRO Stick/Live TIG welders and the Rogue ET 201iP PRO, a TIG/Stick inverter that also offers a DC Pulsed TIG output and high-frequency (HF) TIG arc starts. All units can adjust Stick pulsing frequency between 0.2 and 100 Hz; the pulsed background current can be adjusted between 60 to 80 percent of peak current. Pulsed Stick welding provides more control over heat input to minimize warping and distortion when welding thinner materials and can improve out-of-position welding for better quality welds. ""Pulsed Stick welding reduces spatter for less cleaning and a better weld bead appearance and improves control over heat input. ""Pulsing can minimize distortion when welding thin gauge materials, prevent burn-through on joints with poor fit-up, alleviate undercut and improve puddle control for welding out-of-position,"" said Vinicius Nunes, Product Marketing Director, ESAB. Rogue welders are now in stock and available through standard distribution and online sales channels. According to ESAB, all Rogue ES and ET welders offer lightweight portability as well as the flexibility of 120 - 230V ± 15%, 50/60 Hz primary power and work well off generators with at least a 7 kW of output. Power Factor Correction (PFC) ensures a stable arc that is resistant to power fluctuations even while working off long extension cables up to 300 feet (12 AWG size).",MarineLink,2025-10-01T09:17:11Z,https://www.marinelink.com/news/esab-enhances-rogue-stick-tig-inverters-530607,2025-10-01 17:26:57.233673,0.2078431372549019
"Electricity tariff hike will not impact inflation, but some businesses to see increase in operational expenditure - Report - MyJoyOnline","The recent a 1.14% hike in electricity tariff with effect from 1st October 2025 will not have inflation in the final quarter of this year, as the favourable base effect in the upcoming months beginning in September 2025 will outweigh this modest hike in electricity tariff. However, businesses, particularly Fast-Moving Consumer Goods and Oil Marketing Companies, that rely heavily on grid-powered electricity for operations would experience a modest uptick in operational charges. According to IC Research, a leading financial and investment research firm, this strengthens the case for TOTALEnergies to sustain the ongoing solarisation of its service stations which contributed to the containment of operational expenditure growth at 12.9% year-on-year in half-year 2025 (below average inflation). However, Fan Milk PLC will likely face further cost headwinds in the quarters ahead, having grappled with a 44.2% year-on-year growth in operational expenditure in the first-half of 2025. It continued that the government renewed commitment to the quarterly adjustment formula is positive for the energy sector as it helps stakeholders move towards what they perceive as ""cost reflective tariff"". ""Also, we continue to observe compliance by the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) with the Cash Waterfall Mechanism agreed for paying service providers within the energy sector. The ECG has fully complied with payments so far this year, partly due to the enforcement of a Treasury Single Account for the ECG"", it added. It mentioned that latest available data (July 2025) revealed that the ECG fully complied with the agreed disbursement amounts for all Level A beneficiaries (seven IPPs and two fuel suppliers) and Level B beneficiaries (State entities in the sector). From June 2025 to September 2025, the Government of Ghana via the Ministry of Finance disbursed a total of US$682.31 million to support the energy sector. This figure comprises of US$94.04 million for liquid fuel, US$152.38 million for IPPs, and US$435.88 million for gas supplies and transportation services.",MyJoyOnline.com,2025-10-01T09:16:37Z,https://www.myjoyonline.com/electricity-tariff-hike-will-not-impact-inflation-but-some-businesses-to-see-increase-in-operational-expenditure-report/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.233899,0.3725490196078431
New York AG James sues Homeland Security for nearly $34 million over transit funding freeze,"(Reuters) -New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday filed a lawsuit and an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the department, accusing them of unlawfully withholding nearly $34 million in funding requested by the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MTA is the state agency that operates New York City's subway and buses, as well as commuter rail lines that serve nearby suburbs. In a late Tuesday lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York James is seeking an emergency order by midnight to safeguard the MTA's funding. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. ""DHS today cut New York's award from nearly $34 million to zero - an unlawful decision,"" her press office said in a statement, adding that James is not seeking disbursement tonight, only preservation of the funds while the courts resolve the case. The move, James said, jeopardizes the safety of millions of New Yorkers. ""I am asking the court to act before midnight to stop these funds from vanishing and to ensure that New Yorkers are not put at risk by this administration's political games,"" James said. Last month, the U.S. Transportation Department said it may withhold up to 25% of federal transit funding for the MTA if the agency does not improve safety for subway track maintenance workers.

'Wellness washing' is tricking us all into thinking we're healthy,"We risk losing access to the authentic aspects of wellness if we don't learn to spot this phenomenon and call it out, says Emilie Lavinia I was surprised when I first googled ""wellness washing"" and realised it wasn't a common term. Pages and pages of results appeared, but they were all about ""wellbeing washing"" - mostly in relation to corporate mental health programmes and hollow promises about employee wellbeing. I found nothing about the phenomenon that I - as a wellness editor - spot every day, one that seems to be intensifying by the minute. Thanks to what I'm now calling wellness washing - because it seems to be the best way to describe it - many of us are prioritising hauls of cheaply-made plastic items instead of actually improving our health outcomes. We don't really need to be sleepmaxxing or doing the ""morning shed"" to be healthy. Wellness influencers dominate our social media feeds, encouraging us all to bypass health and healing and instead, buy products using a unique discount code and take part in performative trends, instead of actually learning how we can take better care of ourselves. And companies are getting away with flooding the market with useless items that allow us to cosplay as ""well"". The specific intersection of our collective quest to feel better, the effects of hypercapitalism and the ease with which misleading marketing claims can be made has created a monster. My fear is that wellness washing will continue to undermine the authentic, helpful and often free aspects of wellness and render it an entirely useless and inauthentic concept, if we don't learn to spot it. Wellness is a broad church but it houses so many helpful concepts that many people struggling with mental health issues, chronic illnesses, injuries and issues like addiction have benefitted from. The problem now is that it's hard to tell what's authentic and credible and what's not. You've probably heard of greenwashing - the marketing sleight of hand that led consumers to believe corporations were greener, cleaner and more ethical than those that came before. In the early 2000s, greenwashing ripped through almost every industry. When the Rana Plaza disaster forced fashion into the spotlight and shocking stats about beauty and household goods surfaced, consumers got wise. Shoppers began boycotting brands, demanding better, voting with their wallets. Corporations responded by rebranding as quickly as they could. Slapping on green packaging, skewing statistics and launching ""conscious collections"" and ""eco-friendly"" ranges, all while maintaining the same exploitative supply chains and unsustainable practices. Nothing had really changed, but consumers believed these new greener products were making the world a better place. Neal's Yard CEO Anabel Kindersley has seen this happening in real time. Her brand continues to set the standard for ethical production and is continually aped by businesses claiming to be just as sustainable, yet do very little to actually meet minimum standards. ""You don't have to compromise when it comes to your beauty, you can have it all,"" she explains. ""You can treat people fairly, use ethical sustainable practices, farm in the right way where you're not using pesticides. Make sure that you're using the best ingredients. Paying people a fair price for their farming."" However, very few brands seem to be actually doing this work, which has given rise to more of the same. Now the global wellness industry - worth an eye-watering $6.8 trillion - is the latest space to play host to a circus of spurious claims, faux products and spokespeople with either a total lack of knowledge or integrity, or both. Sophie Attwood, a branding expert and the head of an agency that handles PR for some of the world's largest and most well known health and wellness brands explains that, ""brands evolving their language to reflect consumer priorities isn't a problem in itself. However, when the claims drift too far from reality, or when there's no substantiated benefit, it can not only impact consumers negatively with regards to them being effectively mis-sold, but it can also backfire hugely on a brand. Ultimately, consumers start to lose trust. Once trust is lost, it's incredibly difficult to rebuild"". : The wellness world is hot for infrared - but do these saunas really offer revolutionary cellular healing? Wellness is a vast, slippery concept because it essentially refers to your own personal yardstick of feeling physically, mentally and spiritually well - and this looks different for everyone. Wellness comprises Pilates influencers in Lululemon leggings sipping matcha lattes, neuroscientists publishing research on the effects of meditation, biohacking bros tracking their sleep scores, menopausal cold-water swimmers seeking respite from symptoms and brand founders building products to meet their own specific health needs. The breadth of wellness and the lack of defining credentials in the space is exactly what makes it ripe for exploitation. ""The 'wellness industry' has evolved so much over the last decade or so and with the amount of consumer interest, it's perhaps unsurprising that brands attempt to bend their products to fit wellness-aligned ideas,"" explains psychotherapist Eloise Skinner. ""As with any trend, though, I think there are dangers of dilution (the concept of 'wellness' becoming so broad that it loses meaning), over saturation (too many brands trying to do the same thing) and cyclical trend shifting (consumers pushing in the opposite direction, as the 'wellness era' starts to feel outdated, or tied to a particular generation)."" Wellness washing, at least in the way I've begun to use the term, is the use of misleading marketing messaging leading consumers to believe that a product or service is good for them - when in fact it's probably neutral at best, harmful at worst or entirely unrelated to health and wellness. Brands and practitioners are now slipping ""wellness"" into anything and everything, repackaging everyday goods as wellness essentials, or creating cheap imitation products that exploit workers and the planet - behaviour that is not exactly tantamount to anyone's wellbeing. Take Primark, often criticised for its trend-led fast fashion. The retail behemoth now sells ""wellness"" products which seem to be targeting teenagers. On one level, I admire young people wanting to take care of themselves at such pivotal stages of life, but what brands like Primark are really doing by creating these products isn't authentic, it's encouraging teens to cosplay as healthy. Cheap dupes of activewear, skincare and mindfulness journals likely won't support good health. It's also unlikely that they'll last for years, contain safe, quality ingredients and will be made using sustainable practices or fair labour, yet, they still give buyers a dopamine hit - the illusion of having invested in their wellbeing. It's not just Primark. TikTok Shop and Temu are prime examples of sites where wellness washing takes place, but even mainstream retailers play host to wellness pretenders. Body washes full of phthalates and sulphates marketed as ""clean beauty,"" ""protein"" yoghurts that are mainly sugar and preservatives, jelly face masks that kill marine life and so on line the shelves of your favourite stores. ""Wellness and sustainability are intrinsically linked. A brand can't credibly position itself as wellness-led if, behind the scenes, it's cutting corners on labour or the environment,"" says Attwood. ""Consumers today are far more aware and connected than they've ever been and sooner or later, the truth always comes out. Authentic wellness branding, as with any branding I suppose, has to extend beyond the product and encompass the full story, which includes the supply chain, the ethics, and the impact."" : The 2025 wellness trends you need to know about, according to experts So why might we be happy to believe that something is good for us, despite there being signs that it isn't or that the messaging might not be accurate? ""I think there are a number of reasons this could happen, depending on the person and the type of messaging,"" explains Skinner. ""One example could be an authority bias, where we assume that a brand has some type of authority (for example, a supplement that is marketed as having medical benefits) we might be more likely to believe claims made surrounding the product. This could also extend to products that are marketed in similar ways to authority-related products, such as a wellness product that uses medical-style branding and marketing. Another factor could be confirmation bias - where we already want to believe a product will help us in some way, we might look for evidence to back up that claim. ""Other factors could include the placebo effect (where we think a product will have a certain effect, we might actually feel some kind of benefit, reinforcing our original beliefs), or marketing fatigue (where it's too difficult or time-consuming to research and investigate every claim, so we begin to take things at face value). There's a social value associated with it as well, and so it could draw on themes of belonging, connection and social ties,"" she adds. We're also witnessing a boom in influencers and professionals leveraging the term ""wellness"" to sell products and services. Many influencers have pivoted into wellness content yet make their living selling weight loss shakes and beauty products that contain harmful ingredients that might actually damage health, rather than support it. Consumers often mimic the lifestyles of influencers, often at great personal cost, so it stands to reason that if offered a discount code for a wellness washed product or a cheap dupe of an expensive product, a person might purchase it in order to emulate their favourite influencer's lifestyle. Most wellness products aren't considered medical products or food and therefore don't undergo rigorous testing, accreditation or approval as these two categories of product. They slip neatly into a grey area where pseudoscience and marketing jargon flourishes. Consumers are left exposed and become easy to manipulate, particularly if they're keen to upgrade their lifestyles, mimic influencers or are desperately seeking health solutions. A lack of scientific data is also a wider problem in wellness. More robust studies and objective clinical trials are needed across the entire industry to corroborate health claims and anecdotal evidence. I receive emails every single day from brands with a ""new wellness launch."" More often than not, it's the same old product in new packaging, stamped with the word ""wellness"". It's easy for someone like me to see through this kind of play, but for many customers, the appeal is strong. Of course, I am by no means saying that affordable products or new iterations of existing products can't be decent. Wellness shouldn't be a luxury reserved for those with disposable incomes, nor should any brand be criticised for improving an existing formula. However, brands, influencers and retailers should be held accountable for pretending to care about consumer wellbeing while actively eroding it through their practices. ""For many people, it might be a simple economic decision - perhaps expensive products are unavailable. The influence of consumerist culture could also play a role, since so many things are disposable, and easily replaced, we might pick a cheaper option with the knowledge that it might end up discarded,"" says Skinner. There's also a big cultural push towards trying different options as short-term experiments (for example, in 'get ready with me' videos, where a content creator might experiment with a new product), so it might feel more financially viable to pick cheaper options for use in the short-term, rather than trying to find a singular (more expensive) long-term solution."" : Is drinking tap water bad for you? Wellness influencers say yes, but here's what the experts think The wellness industry has become one of the most insidious gatekeepers of quality products. It offers accessibility while prioritising profit, dangling self-care like a carrot at the end of a very long stick. However, this is all occurring against a backdrop of rising profit margins and inflation, whilst influencers promote luxury lifestyles as being accessible and normal while the average UK wage remains low. So we're seeing dupe culture and sly marketing play out across industries like fashion, beauty and home goods too. Though Attwood explains that wellness itself has definitely become shorthand for aspirational living. ""At scale, this is happening because consumers have redefined what luxury means. It's no longer purely material, luxury is now linked to feeling good and being healthy, and brands have tried to adapt to this cultural shift,"" she says. ""Ultimately, you're looking for proof points or trust markers, as I often like to call them. Does the brand back up its claims with research, expertise, or transparency about its processes? Or is it just adopting the visual language of wellness without any substance? Look for brands who communicate consistently, who are willing to acknowledge limitations as well as benefits, and who invest in long-term practices rather than short-term buzz."" she adds. Kindersley explains that real discernment takes a lot of Googling. ""It takes a lot of looking, but there are experts you can look to who know their stuff and there are brands that you can trust as well. I think it's a minefield and we all do have to help each other. ""Look for third party certification, that's a really good start, because the rigour from that certification is pretty stringent and it's all the way down to the packaging and how you're treating people. Look for the soil association or cosmos logo on the product too. Education, truth, honesty and transparency is really critical and key in this."" Ultimately it's down to consumers to think critically about what wellness really means. At this point we should be encouraging consumers, especially young ones, to be discerning, to read labels and to question product health claims. Wellness, at its heart, is about feeling better in your body, mind and spirit - not filling your bathroom shelves with plastic that will outlive you in landfill. Wellness washing isn't just a phenomenon propped up by offensive marketing, it's a long con. And if we don't call it out now, it's going to eventually make us all sicker than before - not a promising prospect for those who wish to be well.",The Independent,2025-10-01T09:00:24Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/wellness-washing-trend-dupe-skincare-sleep-b2837122.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.235532,0.4509803921568627
'Historic' Welsh pub full of beams and roaring fires in a 'hidden gem' town | Wales Online,"With its low-hanging beams, crackling fires and centuries-old character, this historic coaching inn provides the ideal base for discovering one of North Wales' most evocative towns. Tracing its origins to 1522 and nestled within the medieval walls of Caernarfon, the Black Boy Inn's structure is rich with heritage. Its robust stone walls, wooden panelling and twisting staircases tell the story of more than 500 years of existence in Caernarfon, formerly a thriving port and market settlement. Nowadays, the establishment functions as both hotel and pub, where patrons are equally drawn by the beverages and cuisine as they are by the opportunity to experience accommodation that marries contemporary comfort with traditional appeal. On Tripadvisor, the Black Boy Inn is portrayed as ""full of character"" and ""the best place to stay"" in Caernarfon. Visitors repeatedly highlight the cordial reception and exceptional team as its principal asset. One guest, who arrived following a disappointing evening elsewhere, remembered: ""As soon as we walked through the door we breathed a huge sigh of relief. We had a wonderful welcome and immediately felt at home."", reports the Express. Cuisine and beverages represent another standout feature. The establishment serves generous helpings of regionally influenced fare, whilst its twin bars offer an extensive selection of Welsh ales. Additionally, the ambience has been commended as ""friendly"" and ""welcoming."" The Black Boy Inn's location is another factor contributing to its popularity. Tucked within the ancient town walls of Caernarfon, the inn is a mere stone's throw from the formidable 13th-century Caernarfon Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site erected by Edward I. Visitors can wander through its towering towers, battlements and museums, then amble down to the harbour or indulge in the shops and eateries nestled within the historic streets. Caernarfon itself is one of Wales' hidden treasures. Home to just under 10,000 residents, it sits on the Menai Strait opposite Anglesey, with Eryri (Snowdonia) ascending to the east. The town boasts a high percentage of Welsh speakers - around 87% - and a rich Royal history, being the site of the 1969 investiture of the Prince of Wales. As a starting point for exploration, it's unbeatable. The Welsh Highland Railway departs from Caernarfon, offering steam train journeys deep into the mountains. The Menai Strait offers opportunities for boat cruises, while walkers and cyclists can traverse the Lon Eifion trail for panoramic views across the landscape. Dinas Dinlle beach, with its golden sands, is just a brief drive away. For those who prefer to stay local, Caernarfon has its own attractions. Afternoon tea at The Old Courthouse, artisan shopping at Cei Llechi, and seafood dinners by the harbour at the Anglesey Arms all contribute to unforgettable days out. At the Black Boy Inn, evenings are ideally spent nestled by the fire, pint in hand, savouring the unique ambience that only a centuries-old pub can provide. One satisfied guest summarised their three-day visit saying: ""It is a beautiful historic building which has been most sympathetically updated... The pub is also a very popular eating place. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and highly recommend.""",WalesOnline,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/travel/historic-welsh-pub-full-beams-32552519,2025-10-01 17:26:57.235821,0.4431372549019608
Security Forces Foil Major Maoist Conspiracy In Chhattisgarh's Bijapur Forest | Nation,"Raipur: In a significant breakthrough in the ongoing anti-Naxal operations, the Cobra 208 Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) uncovered a massive cache of explosives and daily-use materials hidden by Maoists in the dense forests of the FOB Kauragutta area, under the jurisdiction of Police Station Pamed in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district. The operation, part of a routine patrol and search mission, led security forces to a concealed pit in the forest near the village of Kanchal. Upon excavation, they discovered a large stockpile of materials believed to be part of a major Maoist conspiracy. Officials stated that the timely and vigilant action of the Cobra unit thwarted what could have been a devastating attack. Recovered items included high-grade explosives such as RDX, gunpowder, BGL cells and rounds, Cardex wire, electric and non-electric detonators, improvised arrow bombs, and grenades. The presence of iron rods used in barrels and firecrackers further indicated plans for assembling IEDs and other explosive devices. In addition to weaponry, the dump contained logistical and technical supplies: batteries, solar inverters, lithium batteries, spools of copper wire, steel containers, plastic drums, steel pipes, iron files, and various steel plates. Maoist uniforms, cobra-pattern combat cloth, pitthu (raksack) bags, and coloured cloths used for identification were also recovered, suggesting preparations for a large-scale mobilisation. Security officials believe the cache was intended to support a coordinated Maoist offensive, possibly targeting security installations or public infrastructure. The recovery aligns with recent trends observed under 'Operation Sankalp', a statewide initiative launched in April to dismantle Maoist strongholds in Chhattisgarh. The operation has already led to the neutralisation of several top Maoist commanders and the seizure of large quantities of arms and supplies. This latest success reinforces the effectiveness of the Cobra battalion's jungle warfare tactics and intelligence coordination. It also underscores the persistent threat posed by Maoist insurgents in the Bastar region, despite ongoing efforts to eliminate Left-Wing Extremism by March 2026, as pledged by both the Union and state governments. Authorities have praised the Cobra 208 Battalion for its swift and decisive action, which averted a potential tragedy and dealt another blow to Maoist capabilities in the region.",Ommcom News,2025-10-01T09:16:20Z,https://ommcomnews.com/india-news/security-forces-foil-major-maoist-conspiracy-in-chhattisgarhs-bijapur-forest/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.236031,-0.1450980392156863

And to date [in 2025], it is almost US$252 million and you don't even have Christmas clearances yet. That growth is extraordinary,"" the President said. Dr. Ali said the government will ensure that such financial trends do not compromise the country's economic stability or create opportunities for capital flight. ""This is an effort to monitor and ensure that we have enough foreign currency in the market. Of course, we're in a position where we can clear the foreign currency, but we have to also protect Guyana's interest, so the government, with immediate effect, will be implementing a series of policy measures,"" the President said. Ali stressed that the government must ensure that such financial trends do not compromise the country's economic stability or create opportunities for capital flight. The new measures which will be enforced with immediate effect are as follows: 1. Invoices required for forex requests: Any request for foreign exchange at commercial banks must be accompanied by a copy of the commercial invoice. 2. Verification upon arrival: Importers will be required to submit the invoice and bill of lading to the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) and their bank once goods arrive, to verify that items were indeed brought into Guyana. 3. Conditional access to future forex: If customers fail to submit verified documents, their subsequent requests for foreign exchange will not be processed. 4. Central Bank Clearing Window: Commercial banks will submit invoices and bills of lading to the Bank of Guyana for further verification through a newly established single-window system. 5. Credit Card Restrictions: Personal credit cards must not be used to settle business obligations. 6. Penalties for inflated invoicing and capital flight: Entities involved in over-invoicing, property transactions, or related-party transfers designed to move capital offshore will face penalties. 7. Declaration of currency sources: Persons leaving Guyana with foreign currency must declare the source, whether from banks or cambios, to enhance transparency. 8. Local bank accounts for oil & gas companies: All entities registered under the Local Content Law must maintain a local bank account into which foreign currency earnings are remitted. 9. Central Bank Clearinghouse: A single-window post-clearing system will reconcile transactions among the GRA, commercial banks, and the Bank of Guyana before new forex requests are facilitated. TRANSPARENCY AND ENFORCEMENT President Ali said that these measures are designed to close loopholes and eliminate duplication, adding that: ""This will take away all the accusations and bring parity in the system."" The President further cautioned against shell companies and related-party invoicing schemes used to disguise capital flight. He added that the Central Bank and the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) will coordinate closely with commercial banks to ensure compliance and identify breaches. Tuesday's engagement stressed the importance of safeguarding foreign currency use to prevent misappropriation and ensure compliance with regulations. The engagement was welcomed with commitments from all stakeholders present to work together to implement and monitor the measures.",Guyana Chronicle,2025-10-01T09:15:26Z,https://guyanachronicle.com/2025/10/01/guyanas-financial-system-gets-timely-boost-in-security-transparency/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.237088,0.4588235294117646

Liverpool legend John Barnes declared bankrupt after company racks up £1.5m debt,"John Barnes has been declared bankrupt after running up debts of more than £1.5m through his media firm. A bankruptcy order was issued in the High Court of Justice last week before being published in the London Gazette on Tuesday. The issue stems from his now-liquidated company John Barnes Media Limited, of which the Liverpool legend had been banned from being a director for three and a half years due to the debts. Liquidators' reports show he owed HMRC £776,878 in unpaid VAT, National Insurance, and PAYE, alongside £461,849 to unsecured creditors and a £226,000 directors loan. Barnes has so far paid back £60,000 after agreeing to return the directors loan in instalments. The former winger, who was the first player to earn £10,000-a-week, has faced multiple bankruptcy petitions since 2010, including one in 2023 which related to a £238,000 personal tax bill that was settled at the final hour. Barnes previously revealed how he has been poorly guided financially over the years and spoke on the All Things Business podcast about the eye-watering amount he has had to give to the taxman. ""Like a lot of elite sportspeople, I got burned because I trusted people, I got caught out a couple of times and ended up losing between £1m and £1.5m over four years,"" he said in August. ""In 2017, I began talking to HMRC about what I could do to repay what I owed."" The 61-year-old said that he has repaid £2.2m since 2017 and continues to pay £10,000 each month. Barnes also addressed what he claims are misleading reports about his financial affairs, reaffirming his commitment to repaying what he owes. He added: ""I know how hard it is for people out there. I don't want to say there are loopholes, or that I can get away with this or that, or have people think I can be made bankrupt and keep my assets, because I've already sold everything. I don't have any assets. ""But every time something new comes up, stories appear in the press saying negative things about how I am not paying my taxes, even though I'm going to court, not to be made bankrupt, but to ask for permission to keep paying. ""Football is a working-class sport, and I don't want hard working people thinking I've got all this money and I won't pay tax. It would be easy to be made bankrupt because they can't take anything else from me."" Barnes earned 79 England caps during a playing career spanning almost two decades, in which he won two league titles with Liverpool.",The Independent,2025-10-01T09:07:44Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/john-barnes-bankrupt-liverpool-b2837130.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.237405,-0.03529411764705881
Reliable server optimiztion - that actually does something,"Any one have any recommendations on a reliable review and optimization of my server. I know the basics but I am looking for someone experienced to optimize my server based on my particular use case. The problem is, in the past I have paid people for a few hours of work and they didn't really do anything besides basic config stuff I already know how to do and the optimizations didn't really make any difference in the speed and load management of my server. Is this type of thing best to look for on Upwork or Freelancer or is it really better to just take the extra time myself to dig in and try to spend the time myself. I am a Linux admin but I am trying to get out of the part of the management where I have to do all the work so I can focus more on the clients and getting new business so I don't really want to spend 10-15 hours digging around internet and following all different recommendations. I went through that all about 5 years ago and there were so many different recommendations. One person would say ""Do yada yada yada"" Then a different person would say ""That only helps with page speed, not with load on server"" etc. I have a dedicate server that has two ecommerce sites using Woocommerce. I am wanting to optimize the server for one of the sites that has much higher level of traffic. I use litespeed with mysql and my main problem in the past has been when I start to get a lot of concurrent users during sales it really starts to drag. I know you can't make Woo handle thousands of concurrent users if you don't have the proper resources so I am just looking to be able to max out my concurrent users with what I have (Ryzen 9 9950X, 128GB Ram). I am using php 8.2 and upgrading to the HPOS filesystem to try to help speed up Woo. So what do you guys think? Look for a stack developer on Upwork or Freelancer, look here, or just dig in and try to tweak it as I go?

This small, voluntary contribution will directly support local charities focused on providing meals to the homeless, mid-day meals for schoolchildren, and food donations to combat hunger. Guests will be informed of the initiative through table tents and other communication channels, ensuring transparency and choice. ""We are thrilled to partner with Paisa4Plates to bring this meaningful initiative to our guests in India,"" said Shibani Malhotra, General Manager, ICONIQA Mumbai. ""This aligns with our core mission to make travel impactful for all. By offering our guests the opportunity to contribute to such a worthy cause, we hope to create a ripple effect of positive change in communities across India."" Aryaveer Baljee, the visionary behind Paisa4Plates, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, ""Hospitality is about more than just service--it's about building bridges and uplifting communities. After the success of Pounds4Plates in the UK, I felt compelled to bring this model to India, where the need is immense. Partnering with ICONIQA and Royal Orchid Hotels, brands with a strong and growing presence in India, allows us to scale this initiative and make a tangible difference in the lives of the hungry and homeless."" The Paisa4Plates movement is designed to be sustainable and low-barrier, allowing hotels to act as facilitators while gaining goodwill and positive engagement from guests. The program will launch across Royal Orchid's Indian properties in late 2025, covering with plans to expand its reach in collaboration with local NGOs and food banks.

An adaptive autoregressive diffusion approach to design active humanized antibodies and nanobodies - Nature Machine Intelligence,"Humanization is a critical process in designing antibodies and nanobodies for clinical trials. Developing widely recognized deep learning frameworks for this task remains valuable yet challenging. Here, inspired by the success of diffusion models, we introduce HuDiff, an adaptive diffusion approach for humanizing antibodies and nanobodies from scratch, referred to as HuDiff-Ab and HuDiff-Nb. This approach initiates humanization exclusively with complementarity-determining region sequences, eliminating the need for humanized templates. On public benchmarks, HuDiff-Ab generates humanized antibodies that more closely resemble experimentally humanized sequences than existing models. Similarly, HuDiff-Nb produces nanobodies with higher humanness scores and nativeness than alternative methods. We apply HuDiff to humanize a murine antibody targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and two alpaca-derived nanobodies, one targeting the receptor-binding domain and the other targeting the C345c domain of C3. Bio-layer interferometry shows the best-performing humanized antibody retains binding affinity comparable to the parental antibody (0.15 nM versus 0.12 nM). Both humanized nanobodies maintain binding to their respective antigens, with the best-performing one exhibiting a substantially enhanced affinity (2.52 nM versus 5.47 nM), corresponding to a 54% improvement over the parental nanobody. Neutralization assays confirm that the humanized sequences effectively neutralize the virus. These results demonstrate that HuDiff improves antibody and nanobody humanness while preserving or enhancing binding and function.",Nature,2025-10-01T09:15:34Z,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01120-9,2025-10-01 17:26:57.240824,0.2156862745098038
Indonesia's Palm Oil Export Soars 35% to Over $16 Billion,"Jakarta. Indonesia saw a double-digit growth in its palm oil exports this year as the price of the country's top commodity soars, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS). Indonesia exported around $16.66 billion in crude palm oil (CPO) and its processed products between January and August 2025. Southeast Asia's biggest economy had sold about $12.32 billion of palm oil to its foreign partners over the same period last year. ""So our palm oil exports grew by 35.23 percent year-on-year [yoy] in the first eight months of 2025,"" M Habibullah, a deputy for statistics production at BPS, told a press conference on Wednesday. BPS attributed the growth to price increases of the said agricultural commodity. Indonesia had been selling its palm oil at an average price of $1,041.32 a ton over the same period, up by 19.91 percent yoy. The average price averaged at around $868.42 a ton last year. Export volume surged 13.56 percent yoy from 14.26 million tons to 16.20 million tons. The agency, however, did not reveal Indonesia's top palm oil export market destinations. Even so, data showed vegetable oils made up a huge chunk of Indonesia's exports to fellow BRICS economy India. New Delhi-bound animal or vegetable oils and fats totaled $2.73 billion in January-August. This is equivalent to 21.71 percent of Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports to India. US President Donald Trump's import duties of 19 percent on Indonesian goods already kicked in on August 7. The Indonesian government has been nudging the Trump administration to give tariff exemptions for its palm oil. ""We exported around 2.6 million tons of CPO and its derivatives [to the US] in August alone,"" Habibullah said, without going into details on the export value. Habibullah also gave the latest developments in Indonesia's trade with the European Union (EU), with whom Jakarta will have a free trade agreement by early 2027. The statistics body reported that Indonesia's palm oil products entering the EU market reached $192.64 million in August. However, the eight-month export to Europe totaled $1.27 billion, BPS reported. Soaring palm oil exports also helped Indonesia maintain its 64-month trade surplus streak since May 2020.",Jakarta Globe,2025-10-01T09:14:55Z,https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesias-palm-oil-export-soars-35-to-over-16-billion,2025-10-01 17:26:57.241195,0.01960784313725483
"Negros Trade Fair marks 40 years of resilience, posts P151M in sales","The country's longest-running provincial trade show celebrated its 40th year as the Negros Trade Fair concluded its week-long showcase on 23-28 September at the SMX Convention Center Aura, SM Aura Premier, in Taguig. Speaking on the 1 October episode of DAILY TRIBUNE's Straight Talk, Mary Ann Colmenares, chairperson of the 2025 Negros Trade Fair, and Christina Gaston, president of the Association of Negros Producers, described this year's event as a time of ""many firsts."" The fair moved to a new venue after decades in Makati and welcomed a new set of exhibitors following the creation of the Negros Island Region. For the first time, small and medium-sized enterprises from Negros Oriental and Siquijor also participated. Special activities were staged to celebrate local government units, including San Carlos Day featuring the Pinta Flores Festival, and Bacolod Day, which brought the MassKara Festival to Manila. The Negros Trade Fair began in 1985, organized by 15 women and one man during the sugar crisis, which had devastated the province that produced more than half of the country's sugar and relied on it for 70 percent of its economy. With displaced sugar workers struggling to survive, private citizens organized the first fair at the Ayala Carpark to promote local products and provide livelihood. ""It was really private citizens who put up the first trade fair. As a matter of fact, the trade fair came before the Association of Negros Producers,"" Gaston explained, noting it was born out of survival. Back then, the fair featured only 30-50 booths over a 10-day period, showcasing homemade food, family recipes, handicrafts, garments, embroidery, woodwork, and ceramics. Today, the Negros Trade Fair continues to thrive. This year's event recorded P54 million in spot sales and P97 million in booked orders during the six-day run. Looking ahead, Colmenares and Gaston announced that Negros will host the Terra Madre Asia-Pacific Slow Food event in November, welcoming 2,000 delegates from 20 countries -- another milestone for the province's thriving local industries.",Daily Tribune,2025-10-01T09:14:06Z,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/10/01/negros-trade-fair-marks-40-years-of-resilience-posts-p151m-in-sales,2025-10-01 17:26:57.241553,0.3490196078431373

"India Sees Billionaire Boom, Adding Over One Tycoon Per Week In 2025: Hurun Report","New Delhi: India's billionaire club is growing at a record pace, with the country adding more than one billionaire every week this year, a new report said on Wednesday. The M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025 shows that India now has 350 billionaires, six times higher than when the list was first released 13 years ago. The 14th edition of the Hurun list features 1,687 individuals with wealth of over Rs 1,000 crore. This includes 284 new entrants, with the total number rising by 148 compared to last year and by 859 in the past five years. ""Together, the listers added wealth at the rate of Rs 1,991 crore every single day,"" as per the report. The combined wealth of everyone on the list stands at Rs 167 lakh crore, up 5 per cent from last year. To put this in perspective, the figure is larger than Spain's GDP and equals nearly half of India's GDP. However, the average wealth per person declined slightly to Rs 9,850 crore from Rs 10,320 crore last year, impacted by global tariff issues and geopolitical tensions. India's top 10 richest are getting wealthier and younger. The entry bar for the top 10 has risen to Rs 1.83 lakh crore, compared to Rs 1.63 lakh crore last year, while their average age has dropped to 69, three years younger than before. Remarkably, the top 10 alone hold wealth equal to 28 per cent of the rest of the entire list, the list showed. Startups have emerged as a strong driver of wealth creation, with 97 startup founders making it to the 2025 list. Among them, 46 are new entrants, including 12 from publicly listed startups. In fact, 74 per cent of the new names this year are self-made entrepreneurs, showing India's growing appetite for wealth creation beyond traditional industries. Pharmaceuticals led the way with 137 individuals, followed by industrial products (132) and chemicals & petrochemicals (125). On the demographic side, Mumbai continues to dominate with 451 individuals on the list, followed by New Delhi (223) and Bengaluru (116). Women also made their mark, with 101 entrants this year, including 26 dollar billionaires. The average age of the listers remains 65, the same for both men and women.

Nigeria's Current Account Surplus Rose To $5.28bn Q2 2025  --  CBN,"Nigeria has recorded a rise in its current account surplus to $5.28 billion in the second quarter of 2025, up from $2.85 billion in Q1. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disclosed this on Tuesday in a Frequently Asked Questions published on its official website. According to the apex bank, the increase reflected a stronger external sector resilience and improved foreign exchange inflows. The gross external reserves also rose to $43.05 billion as of September 11, providing 8.28 months of import cover. ""The growth in external reserves serves as a source of confidence to citizens, foreign and local investors, and other economic agents,"" the CBN stated. It attributed the improvement to sustained exchange rate stability, tighter monetary policy, and a moderation in petroleum product prices, all of which have contributed to a more favorable balance of payments outlook. According to the latest data from the CBN, the country's external reserve has increased by over $692 million in 18 days. It also shows that the reserve has been on an upward swing since the 14th of July 2025. The closest the external reserve has gotten to the present figure was on September 27, 2019, when it hit $41.992 billion. However, Nigeria's external reserves surpassed the $42 billion mark as of Thursday, September 25, 2025, the highest in over six years. The increase was also confirmed by President Bola Tinubu in his Independence Day address to Nigerians on October 1. The CBN's FAQ also explained why the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) recently reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for commercial banks from 50% to 45%. ""The reduction seeks to ease the liquidity burden on commercial banks, thereby providing more room for productive lending and intermediation,"" the CBN explained. To counter excess liquidity from public sector accounts outside the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the MPC also introduced a 75% CRR on non-TSA public sector deposits. ""This measure ensures that these deposits do not contribute to inflationary pressure, which could undermine the current momentum of disinflation,"" the bank noted. Despite the adjustment, the CBN assured that account holders will retain full access to their funds, with commercial banks equipped to meet all legitimate obligations. The CBN emphasised its commitment to balancing inflation control with support for the real economy, particularly MSMEs. ""We are using conventional monetary policy tools to anchor inflation expectations while ensuring a stable and robust financial system,"" the bank said. By maintaining market stability, financial institutions are better positioned to allocate surplus funds to deficit segments of the economy. The bank reiterated its role as a lender of last resort, providing short-term liquidity support to commercial banks through its Standing Lending Facility. This ensures that banks can meet customer obligations while maintaining systemic stability. READ ALSO: Tax Law Will Provide Relief For Low-Income Earners, Tinubu Assures Nigerians The CBN also provided clarity on its decision to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 50 basis points, lowering it from 27.5% to 27%. The move was announced at the MPC meeting held last week. ""The MPC lowered the MPR by 50 basis points to 27% in response to the sustained decline in inflation over the past five months and in anticipation of further decline in inflation for the remainder of 2025,"" the bank stated. ""Also, the reduction in the policy rate by the MPC would help to support economic recovery efforts of the government without undermining macroeconomic stability."" In addition to the rate cut, the CBN announced a revision to the Standing Facilities corridor, narrowing it from +500/-100 basis points to a symmetric +250/-250 basis points around the MPR. This adjustment marks a shift from an asymmetric to a symmetric corridor, aimed at improving liquidity management and reducing volatility in overnight interest rates. ""Standing facilities refer to monetary policy instruments that help the CBN to provide or mop overnight liquidity in the banking system,"" the bank explained. The two key instruments -- the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) and the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) -- allow banks to borrow or deposit excess liquidity overnight at designated rates. ""This implied that the CBN is currently operating a symmetric corridor in contrast to the asymmetric type,"" the statement added. The central bank emphasised that the corridor adjustment is designed to enhance interbank market efficiency and strengthen monetary policy transmission. ""Overall, this would encourage more active interbank trading and enhance monetary policy transmission,"" the CBN concluded. These measures, the CBN said, were carefully balanced to sustain ongoing disinflation efforts while ensuring the banking sector has adequate liquidity to support credit expansion and economic growth.",Channels Television,2025-10-01T09:10:20Z,https://www.channelstv.com/2025/10/01/nigerias-current-account-surplus-rose-to-5-28bn-q2-2025-cbn/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.243943,0.2078431372549019

P&O Cruises sails into new agency for data-driven boost - DecisionMarketing,"Carnival Corporation-owned P&O Cruises has appointed a new agency as part of plans to develop a more data-driven, personalised and informed approach to its engagement strategy to deepen its connection with guests. MRM UK has been handed the brief to create the holistic, customer-centric approach to guest engagement and will also set the foundations for the evolution of P&O Cruises' loyalty programme, The Peninsular Club.

"BISP Kafalat Rs13,500 last installment of 2025 - 8171 status update - Pakistan Observer","ISLAMABAD - The Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) is set to release the last quarterly installment of Rs13,500 for the year 2025, starting from October 2025, under Benazir Kafalat initiative. The initiative, which was launched in 2008, has emerged as the largest single cash transfer programme in Pakistan's history. It has both short and long-term objectives. The short term objective of the initiative is to protect marginalised people from negative effects of higher inflation, food crisis and poor economic growth. The long term objective of program is to eradicate extreme and chronic poverty, along with women empowerment, as set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Latest statistics show financial assistance is provided to around 10 million deserving families across the country. BISP installments are released by the federal government four times a year, once every three months [January-March, April-June, July-September and October-December]. The final installment for the quarter October-September is issued district wise with different time periods for each area. The BISP beneficiaries can check the status of their installment of Rs13,500 by sending their 13-digit CNIC number to the official code 8171. They will receive instant reply with their payment status. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif officially launches Digital Wallets and SIM provision under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) -- a transformative step toward women empowerment, financial inclusion, and a secure, transparent support system.

Brit declares 'Ibiza is done' as holiday ends in 'Final Destination nightmare' - The Mirror,"A British man holidaying in Ibiza has declared the island ""is done"" as his trip to the Mediterranean ended in disaster. Travel blogger Taylor Budd claimed he had survived a ""natural disaster"" on Tuesday (September 30) as the Spanish island was hit by torrential rain and flooding. Taking to TikTok, he shared footage of his surroundings and revealed he was unable to walk in most directions owing to the deep surface water. ""It has been an absolute nightmare - we got a really loud alert on our phones everywhere on the island,"" he explained in a video. ""It told us to stay away from the sea, from rivers and if you're on the bottom floor of a high-rise or hotel to get to upper floors."" Taylor revealed that the alert had caused everyone in the tourist spot to ""go into a panic"", while he was forced to spend four hours in a taxi as his car became ""really stuck"" during a journey from San Antonio to Playa d'en Bossa - costing him €100. ""I'm more concerned that there was water dripping out of the walls on the motorway,"" Taylor continued, comparing it to the film Final Destination. He said that while Ibiza ""needs rain"", the island ""isn't cut out"" for such extreme conditions, with its drainage system seemingly unable to cope. ""There's flooding everywhere, the whole island is at a standstill, shops are shut and people's apartments are flooded,"" he said. Taylor went on to express fears that buildings could collapse due to Ibiza's infrastructure and architecture ""not built"" the same way as in the UK. While conditions had clearly improved by the evening, he admitted it was still ""carnage"" with venues including Cova Santa postponing events. He closed by showing off knee-deep water amid struggles to find a taxi driver willing to brave the conditions. ""It's a freaking joke,"" Taylor fumed. Last night, Ibiza Airport issued an official statement in response to the severe weather, after videos surfaced of water pouring through the ceiling. The airport said on its website: ""If you are planning to fly to/from Ibiza Airport, please check with your airline about the status of your flight."" It came after Pablo Gárriz, Director General of Emergencies, said Ibiza saw up to 200mm of rain in just two hours. He said the storm's damage potential ""has been evolving"" but added the phenomenon appeared to be losing strength. Around 220 tourists were left trapped after a hillside in the Puig des Molins area gave way and sent large rocks tumbling towards two hotels below. In the aftermath, dozens of police officers and ambulances surrounded the scene, but thankfully just a small number of injuries were reported and all of the hotel guests were eventually freed from the building and rehoused nearby.",Mirror,2025-10-01T09:08:19Z,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/brit-declares-ibiza-done-holiday-35993837,2025-10-01 17:26:57.246672,-0.07450980392156858

"The $7,500 EV Tax Credit Gone Is Gone. Who Will Bear The Higher Costs?","Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. The $7,500 EV tax credit was one of many casualties resulting from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While this bill was signed into law on July 4, the credit did not expire for several months, according to Forbes. However, as of October 1, these credits are no longer available, leading to questions about the future of this segment of the automotive industry. Most notably, the tax incidence for purchasing these vehicles shifts from the Federal government to the purchasers or the car manufacturers. This article discusses how tax incidence shapes retail consumer decisions and whether the disappearance of this credit will affect the automotive industry, most notably, those companies that have invested heavily in the manufacturing and production of EVs. The EV tax credit was first introduced in 2005 and greatly expanded in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The amount that has been given for these vehicles is up to $7,500, which the dealer removed from the price of the car. In turn, the dealer applied for a rebate from the federal government for the amount of the tax credit. This tax credit has led to a massive increase in the number of EVS purchased over the past two decades. As discussed by Forbes, EVs were once extraordinarily expensive, and purchasing one meant an undue financial burden on the consumer. Put differently, most purchasers early on acquired these vehicles less because it was a wise financial decision and more because of the non-financial benefits, such as making a positive impact on the environment and fighting global warming. The EV tax credits changed the calculus for purchasing these vehicles. Many consumers saw the tax incentives as a mechanism to acquire an EV since it substantially lowered the after-tax costs relative to other vehicles. As demand rose due to the lower cost, producers of the EVs ramped up production and enhanced their products. The entire car industry has been upended by newcomers, such as Tesla and Rivian, which offer fully electric vehicle options at prices not much different than their counterparts in gas-powered vehicles. Other manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors, and luxury brand vehicles like Audi and BMW, have increased manufacturing and sales of EVs. Within economic theory lies the concept of ""tax incidence"". This idea was coined early on by research published in the Journal of Political Economy, stating that the person or entity paying the tax may not necessarily be the person physically paying the tax bill to the government. Other academic research has expanded on this concept, demonstrating that tax incidence can vary substantially across taxpayers, business entities, and governmental regimes. As an example, according to CBS News, the state of Illinois will now apply a $0.50 tax on every sports gambling bet made via sports betting apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and Underdog. These gambling companies must decide who will ultimately bear the burden of taxation imposed by the State of Illinois. If the companies bear the tax incidence, then they can determine the tax bill based on the number of wagers and pay it, thereby lowering the company's earnings. However, if the companies want to shift the tax incidence to their customers, then they can add on a $0.50 surcharge to every bet made in the state of Illinois. This addition would make each bet more costly. However, it will be their customer who ultimately bears the burden of taxation. While it may come as little surprise that the gambling companies chose the latter, this example helps illustrate that the tax incidence for new layer of tax fell on the consumers rather than the company. This same tax incidence example applies to the now disappearing EV tax credit. Effective October 1, the $7,500 EV tax credit will no longer be offered for EV purchases. Consider a Tesla Model Y, which has a standard all-in purchase price of around $47,500. On September 30, the price of this vehicle is $40,000, but that price reverts back to its standard purchase price the very next day. Thus, moving forward, the price of the EV will be $7,500 more expensive that it was before the tax credit's expiration. The question now arises whether the company or the taxpayer will bear the incidence of this tax. For instance, Tesla can maintain their price on their vehicles even after the tax credit is no longer offered. However, this decision would come at a risk that consumers may now be less incentivized to purchase the electric vehicles, resulting in a decline in demand at the standard price. On the contrary, Tesla can absorb the costs of the tax credit and continue providing consumers with the same price, even though Tesla will not receive the tax rebates from the government. While the decision by the automobile manufacturers has not yet been made, they will soon need to decide on their pricing strategies now that the EV tax credit is no longer available. The notion that EV manufacturers will need to decide between decreased demand and decreased profit margin suggests that the automobile manufacturers will take a hit to their earnings one way or another due to the disappearing EV tax credit. Put differently, if demand declines because the price is now higher (without a corresponding increase in after-tax earnings) then earnings will fall. Conversely, if the automobile manufacturers absorb the costs, then their profit margins will also decline. What is key for these companies is that they balance out the tax incidence of the reduced tax incentives. As discussed by CNBC, the automobile industry is about to establish a new baseline demand for EVs. With the EV tax credit going away starting October 1, this article demonstrates that the auto manufacturers will need to assess their sensitivity for absorbing these diminished tax incentives by lowering their retail prices or passing these diminished tax incentives onto the consumer by maintaining their prices (albeit with a higher after-tax price). Regardless of their decision, the EV auto industry is now facing its toughest battle as it seeks to continue its rise in popularity without federal EV tax credits.",Forbes,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathangoldman/2025/10/01/who-will-bear-the-burden-of-the-disappearing-7500-ev-tax-credit/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.248105,0.3254901960784313

Transit workers are also participating in the strike, leading to significant disruptions. Ships remain docked in ports across Greece, as the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) has joined the strike. The strike affects all categories of vessels and will last from 00:01 until midnight.

Seafarers' unions stress that long hours already endanger workers' health, safety, and family life. Port workers' unions, including OMYLE, have also joined the protest, demanding the bill's withdrawal, reinstatement of collective agreements, and measures to improve working conditions.

Claim £150 Warm Home Discount this month to lower winter energy bills - Daily Record,"Eight energy firms have opened applications for this year's Warm Home Discount Scheme. Most eligible households in England and Wales will see the £150 discount added automatically to their energy bill this winter, however, the majority of people in Scotland will need to make a claim directly with their provider. Applications will open to all by the end of this month, but there's no fixed date as energy supplier's deal with these claims directly using data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). However, Money Saving Expert (MSE.com) is keeping tabs on those who are currently accepting applications. These include Scottish Gas, British Gas, Octopus Energy, EDF Energy, Co-op Energy, So Energy, Good Energy and Utility Warehouse. Under the UK Government's Plan for Change, over 6 million (6.1m) households will benefit this winter from the £150 discount, which is paid directly to the supplier. This is an increase of 2.7m households, including 900,000 more families with children and a total of 1.8m households in fuel poverty. Every billpayer on means-tested benefits such as Universal Credit or Pension Credit, will now qualify, removing restrictions that previously excluded many who needed help and providing peace of mind to millions more families. The move will see 240,000 Scottish households receive the discount for the first time this winter. Commenting on the expansion of the scheme, Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh recently said: ""We took decisive action earlier this year to expand the Warm Home Discount, giving more working families certainty and peace of mind before winter. ""I now want to make sure as many eligible households as possible get £150 off their energy bill, putting more money in their pockets as part of our Plan for Change. ""If you know someone who might be eligible - please start spreading the word to family and friends, encouraging them to check they are named on their energy bill."" People in England and Wales will qualify for the Warm Home Discount this winter if they are receiving one of the following means-tested benefits and are named on the electricity bill, either in their own name, that of their partner, or their legal representative. For older people in Scotland in receipt of Pension Credit Guarantee Credit and are named on your electricity bill (or your partner or legal representative is), DWP guidance states ""you will likely receive the Warm Home Discount automatically"". Scottish households in receipt of other means-tested benefits will need to apply for the discount directly from their supplier once they open for applications. Application windows will vary depending on the supplier. check on the dedicated pages of your provider's website to find out when it is due to open for winter 2025/26. Full details on the Warm Home Discount Scheme can be found on GOV.UK. Energy bills increased by two per cent on October 1 under the price cap. This means around seven million households on the standard tariff will see annual bills rise from £1,720 to £1,755 from October 1 - a rise of £35 over the coming year. The increase will see bills increase by around £2.93 a month for the average household, leaving a home on a default tariff paying £102 for what currently costs £100 per month. Ofgem changes the price cap for households every three months by setting a maximum price energy suppliers can charge people in Scotland, England and Wales for each kilowatt hour of energy they use. However, it's crucial to remember the price cap does not limit a household's total energy bills - people still pay for each unit of gas and electricity they use which means the more you use, the higher the bill and the less you use, the lower the costs. The price cap will be in place from October 1 until December 31, 2025.",Daily Record,2025-10-01T09:12:01Z,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/claim-warm-home-discount-help-35994036,2025-10-01 17:26:57.249026,0.3490196078431373
Thom Whiddett And Luke Sweeney Talk Cut And Craft For Fall '25,"The founders of London tailoring house Thom Sweeney discuss their latest collection that celebrates texture, craft, and the evolution of modern menswear. Thom Sweeney, the contemporary tailoring house founded by Savile Row-trained tailors Thom Whiddett and Luke Sweeney in 2006, has always placed an emphasis on texture and cut, and these values have been ramped up for its latest A/W '25 collection, showcased in the countryside jaunt campaign shot by Lee Whittaker. Expect tailoring that's sharp, yet tempered with easy pieces, cue unstructured jackets that sit alongside double-breasted suits. Outwear has gone big on character too, featuring shearling-lined bombers and soft leather flight jackets, nodding to Mid-century Americana and early 20th century US Air Force references. Of course, the casual wear gets the same refined treatment, with track pants cut in virgin wool, and then there's an expanded knitwear line, including cashmere-silk tees and polos. The duo shared their thoughts on the season and what's next, from the London expansion to a New York flagship opening next year, along with plans to grow their hospitality offering. Luke Sweeney: For me, it's the brown and grey cashmere overshirt; it's such a versatile piece. It can be worn in so many different ways, with a roll neck or casual shirt, it looks so beautiful and elegant, it's a great option when not wearing a suit. Thom Whiddett: If I put our tailoring aside, then I would say the steel blue / fur-lined cashmere bomber. It's such a great fit with an easier dropped shoulder, and the shade of blue is the perfect colour. It feels amazing to wear it too, especially as the temperature starts to drop. LS: Knitwear has evolved alongside our tailoring over the years; they almost go hand in hand. When we put together our collections, it's so important for us to demonstrate to our clients how you can wear knitwear in different ways. It creates so many options and looks for clients and adds so much value to the men's wardrobe. TW: It's become a far bigger and thus more important category over the past seasons. We've always created pieces that can be worn with tailoring, instead of a classic shirt, to soften the look, but it's evolved into more. We have knitted jackets and cardigans that are substantial pieces in their own right. It's important that the quality of the yarn is the best and the fit is good. Generally, the fits are getting a little easier LS: Tailoring is something that obviously means so much to Thom Sweeney. It's the heartbeat! Coming from a bespoke background, we had a head start on how we wanted a suit to look and feel. The secret is in the detail, armhole, shape, shoulder line, length, trouser rise and length. All the details create the perfect suits. TW: I think the way we have combined both British and Italian principles into our tailoring has helped create something special. This blend and approach helps to create an elegant cut which feels well-proportioned. Combining this with using our favourite British and Italian fabrics, fabrics that perform well and last the test of time. LS: For me, it's the tuxedo, the most important suit in a man's wardrobe in my opinion. It's what we are known for. TW: We're partial to a cord suit in winter, so the moss green cord this season feels very Thom Sweeney, especially dressed down with a chambray shirt and cashmere tie. TW and LW: I love the combination of our black cashmere jacket with the crisp white shirt and pale grey silk grenadine tie; it feels dressed up and elegant in a refreshing way. TW and LS: Yes, we're just finishing the London extension this week. We were lucky enough to be able to take the gallery next door and knock through back to our townhouse. We will have a lovely new space which is in line with the latest style of our LA and Miami stores. Having the extra space and garden will help us create an even more elevated experience in store for all our clients. The next big step for us is opening our new store on Madison Avenue in New York. We start work very soon and aim to complete by late February 2026. TW and LS: We would like to build on the hospitality side of the business. Within each store, we have a 'Sol's' bar (named after Luke's father-in-law, Sol Kerzner). It has a great story attached and is always a focal point of the store and the experience. I was just in New York and one of our regulars said it's his favourite bar in NY (maybe because we don't charge!), but really, it's because of the crowd, a nice mix of our team and all the interesting clients who come through the store.",Forbes,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/felicitycarter/2025/10/01/thom-whiddett-and-luke-sweeney-talk-cut-and-craft-for-fall-25/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.249676,0.223529411764706
UPDATED: Tinubu lists 12 'remarkable economic milestones' of his government,"The Nigerian leader spoke in a nationwide broadcast to mark Nigeria's 65th Independence Anniversary. President Bola Tinubu said on Wednesday that his administration had recorded 12 ""remarkable economic milestones as a result of the implementation of our sound fiscal and monetary policies."" The Nigerian leader spoke in a nationwide broadcast to mark Nigeria's 65th Independence Anniversary. The president listed 12 major milestones, which he said were proof that the economy was recovering. He said the second quarter GDP grew by 4.23 per cent, the fastest in four years, and above the International Monetary Fund's 3.4 per cent forecast. Inflation, which had spiked following the removal of fuel subsidies and unification of exchange rates, fell to 20.12 per cent in August 2025, the lowest level in three years. He said non-oil revenue had reached a record N20 trillion by August, hitting the 2025 target months ahead of schedule, while September alone generated N3.65 trillion, 411 per cent higher than May 2023. Fiscal health had improved with the debt service-to-revenue ratio falling below 50 per cent from 97 per cent. The president also noted that external reserves rose to $42.03 billion in September, the highest since 2019. Nigeria's tax-to-GDP ratio increased to 13.5 per cent, up from less than 10 per cent, with a new tax law coming into effect in January to expand the base while giving relief to low-income earners. He said Nigeria recorded surpluses on trade for five consecutive quarters, with a 44.3 per cent rise in Q2 2025 to N7.46 trillion ($4.74 billion). Non-oil exports now represent 48 per cent of total exports compared with 52 per cent for oil. ""Nigeria is now selling more to the world than we are buying,"" Mr Tinubu said, calling the shift ""a fundamental change that strengthens our currency and creates jobs at home."" Oil production, which had fallen to barely one million barrels per day in May 2023, climbed to 1.68 million barrels, supported by better security in the Niger Delta and new investments. For the first time in four decades, the country refined petrol domestically and became Africa's leading exporter of aviation fuel. He said the naira had stabilised after two years of turbulence, with the gap between official and parallel market rates narrowing sharply due to foreign exchange reforms. ""The multiple exchange rates, which fostered corruption and arbitrage, are now part of history,"" Mr Tinubu declared. Under his administration's social investment scheme, N330 billion had been disbursed to eight million households, many of whom received one or two tranches of N25,000 each. Solid minerals also rebounded strongly, with coal mining expanding 57.5 per cent in Q2 after a 22 per cent contraction in Q1. The president added that transport infrastructure was being expanded nationwide. Rail and water transport grew by 40 per cent and 27 per cent respectively, while projects such as the 284-kilometre Kano-Katsina-Maradi line, the Kaduna-Kano line, the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and Sokoto-Badagry Highway were underway. The Federal Executive Council recently approved $3 billion to complete the Eastern Rail Project. He said global investors and rating agencies were taking notice. Nigeria's stock market, he noted, had surged to 142,000 points in September 2025 from 55,000 points in May 2023. The Central Bank also cut interest rates for the first time in five years, citing improved macroeconomic stability. President Tinubu admitted that the real measure of progress went beyond numbers. ""The accurate measure of our success will not be limited to economic statistics alone, but rather in the food on our families' tables, the quality of education our children receive, the electricity in our homes, and the security in our communities,"" he said. The president acknowledged the high cost of living and urged citizens to embrace productivity and patriotism. ""Let us be a nation of producers, not just consumers. Let us farm our land and build factories to process our produce. Let us patronise 'Made-in-Nigeria' goods. I say Nigeria first. Let us pay our taxes."" ""My message is hope and a call to action... With Almighty God on our side, I can assure you that the dawn of a new, prosperous, self-reliant Nigeria is here,"" he concluded.",Premium Times Nigeria,2025-10-01T06:27:23Z,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/825019-updated-tinubu-lists-12-remarkable-economic-milestones-of-his-government.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.250260,0.08235294117647052
"Vancouver Airport Sets Sights On Rome, Ho Chi Minh City, Melbourne | Aviation Week Network","Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is prioritizing new long-haul links as it builds on strong passenger growth, with unserved markets in Asia-Pacific and Europe leading its network development strategy. Stephen Smart, head of communications for Vancouver Airport Authority, said demand for Vietnam is especially strong. ""If we were making a list and asking people around Western Canada where they'd like to go, Vietnam would be very high on that list,"" he told Routes. Alongside Ho Chi Minh City, other targets include Rome, Barcelona, Melbourne and Lisbon, reflecting both leisure and business demand. YVR welcomed 26.2 million passengers in 2024, its second-highest total ever, alongside a record 339,000 metric tons of cargo. Passenger traffic rose 5.1% year on year, and cargo shipments grew 7%. The airport expects 2025 to surpass both records, fueled by strong transpacific demand. Asia-Pacific volumes are up 15% this year, with international flights to the region increasing 10%. ""Asia-Pacific in particular is a really positive story for us,"" Smart said, pointing to strong demand for services from Japan, South Korea and China. Recent network developments include T'way Air's first-ever Canadian service to Seoul, Zipair's entry from Tokyo Narita and Air Canada's expansion to Manila, Singapore and Bangkok. More News And Analysis From Routes World 2025 India is also high on YVR's long-term agenda, driven by strong demand from British Columbia's large South Asian community. Europe continues to perform well, with traffic up nearly 9% in August. Smart pointed to Southern European cities as priority opportunities, while noting that additional service to the UK is another goal. However, transborder markets have been softer. ""We've had a strong year in 2025 despite geopolitical headwinds, and while we've seen some softening in our transborder routes, it's nothing compared to land border crossings,"" Smart said. He explained that in some months land crossings were down by two-thirds, while air traffic at YVR declined by less than 2%. ""Obviously we don't want to see a drop, but compared to what it could be, that's pretty minimal. We continue to see very strong U.S.-into-Canada traffic."" Vancouver's cruise business also provided a boost, with a strong Alaska season generating additional passenger flows. Latin America represents another long-term growth area. ""There's really strong business connectivity, particularly into Chile in the mining space, but also Argentina and Brazil,"" Smart said. He added that YVR's position makes it a natural connecting point between Asia-Pacific and South America.",Aviation Week,2025-10-01T09:14:21Z,https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/airports-networks/vancouver-airport-sets-sights-rome-ho-chi-minh-city-melbourne,2025-10-01 17:26:57.250505,0.3254901960784313
New Skoda Enyaq SE L 85 SNEAKS into Electric Car Grant territory | Cars UK,"The new Skoda Enyaq SE L 85 arrives as Skoda tweaks its Enyaq offerings to deliver a long-range Enyaq qualifying for the Electric Car Grant. Launched in July, the government had to tweak the offering to cap the top eligible price to £42k a month later, and despite the fanfare of grants of up to £3,750 the only EV to get the top ECG so far has been the Ford Puma Electric (and the Ford E-Tourneo Courier). That £42k model upper limit has driven Skoda to deliver a new electric Enyaq model with the long-range 77kWh battery with the new Enyaq SE L 85, which, miraculously, costs £41,980, undercutting the previous cheapest '85' - the Enyaq Edition 85 - by £2,320 and qualifying for the £1,500 discount. As mentioned, the Enyaq SE L 85 comes with a 77kWh (net) battery delivering an official range of up to 359 miles and powering a single electric motor at the back, good for 282bhp and 0-62mph in 6.7 seconds. Spec for the new 85 SE L isn't exactly hair shirt with 19'' alloys, 13.0'' infotainment, Loft Interior Design, heated front seats and steering wheel, tri-zone climate, predictive cruise, Travel Assist Plus and Keyless. Skoda would also like to flog you a Plus Option Package for £2,500 with full LED Matrix headlights, electric driver seat with memory and massage, LED taillights and animated indicators. It all makes for a good headline offering, but back in the real world, we didn't have to search far to find a brand new range-topping Enyaq 85x SportLine at a Skoda dealer with a list price of £49,440, offered with a £9,617 discount, making it £2k cheaper than this new entry-level 85 SE L.",Cars UK,2025-10-01T09:14:35Z,https://www.carsuk.net/new-skoda-enyaq-se-l-85-sneaks-into-electric-car-grant-territory/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.250669,0.2862745098039217
Spanish court opens 550-mn-euro Meta data protection trial,"CHECK OUT: Don't let unemployment hold you back. Start your digital marketing journey today. A Spanish court opened a trial on Wednesday over a 550-million-euro lawsuit brought by more than 80 Spanish media organisations against Facebook owner Meta for allegedly breaching European Union data protection rules. EU rules oblige companies to obtain users' consent to create personalised advertising from their data. Spain's main media association AMI says the US tech giant, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, created ""unfair competition"" by ""systematically"" breaking the law between May 2018 and July 2023. The association alleges unfair competition in digital advertising sales and is seeking 551 million euros ($647 million) in compensation. ""This isn't a case that affects only AMI's outlets, it has implications for media worldwide,"" AMI director general Irene Lanzaco told reporters before entering the Madrid commercial court where the trial will run until Thursday. ""What's at stake is the very survival of news media, which is being threatened by the predatory behaviour of a platform like Meta, acting with no regard for our legal framework."" Meta has denied any damage or violation of EU rules, saying in a statement sent to AFP the AMI lawsuit ""is not based on any evidence regarding the alleged harm."" AMI is ""deliberately ignoring the evolution of the advertising industry over the past few years,"" Meta added. ""Meta complies with all applicable laws and has provided clear options, transparent information, and a wide range of tools for users to control their experience on our services."" Witnesses are scheduled to testify on Wednesday, with expert reports and closing arguments expected on Thursday. Media groups represented by AMI include Prisa, owner of Spain's top-selling daily newspaper El Pais; Godo, publisher of the Barcelona-based daily La Vanguardia; Vocento, which publishes the conservative daily ABC; and Unidad Editorial, whose titles include El Mundo and sports daily Marca. Spanish radio and television stations have launched a separate lawsuit against Meta for the same reasons, seeking 160 million euros in damages. A similar lawsuit has also emerged in France, where around 200 media groups, including major television networks and leading newspapers, filed legal action against Meta in April.",Legit.ng - Nigeria news.,2025-10-01T09:14:29Z,https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/economy/1676573-spanish-court-opens-550-mn-euro-meta-data-protection-trial/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.250888,-0.1764705882352942

The House of Dior Beverly Hills opens on Rodeo Drive,"In 1990, Dior opened its first store on Rodeo Drive, the first Dior location in North America. Thirty-five years later, the luxury brand owned by the LVMH group has just opened a 60-foot-tall building. Open to the public since Saturday, the store located at 323 North Rodeo Drive called upon its star architect, Peter Marino, chief designer of Dior boutiques, including most recently, 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris and the new flagship store House of Dior New York, which opened in August. The magnificent, undulating stucco façade now revealed its window displays featuring miniature scenes of Paris, including an ultra-detailed model of La Galerie Dior at 30 Avenue Montaigne, complete with characters, realistic settings, and nods to Los Angeles with the ""HollywoodDior"" sign and the Bel-Air hotel. ""A cinematic journey, a luminous dialogue between Paris and Los Angeles that pays tribute to the house's timeless couture heritage,"" explains Dior's team, ""each offering a living tableau of small scenes from Dior's odyssey in the United States."" These animations can also be found on the second floor of the store, in the jewelry section, where a window display pays tribute to designer Christian Dior, accompanied by his faithful dog Bobby. Surrounded by a garden featuring a dancing sculpture by artist Niki de Saint-Phalle, the boutique reveals an interior with light-colored parquet flooring strewn with antique rugs and a palette of natural, earthy colors. In the center stands the sculptural ""Ginkgo"" bench designed by sculptor and artist Claude Lalanne in the late 1990s, from which several bouquets of flowers spring forth. On the ground floor, visitors first discover the space reserved for leather goods and handbags, furnished with seating areas and counters. This is followed by an area dedicated to women's shoes, decorated with sculptural tables and large speckled benches, and another dedicated to perfumes. A corner showcases the house's scarves, presented on wall displays and in a large trunk. In each space, Dior silhouettes blend into the decor. In contrast, the men's section plays on other motifs and a color palette combining brown, camel, and gray tones. The sunglasses collections, all the leather goods for men, and ready-to-wear are presented here. The store's centerpiece, the majestic staircase, a nod to the Barneys New York store in Los Angeles designed by Peter Marino 38 years ago, surrounds a small garden designed by Marino in collaboration with landscape architect Peter Wirtz, offering a panoramic view of the spaces. There are a number of small lounges dedicated to women's ready-to-wear in a Parisian apartment-style setting with Dior gray walls, large mirrors, and angel tapestries. Divided by large gold and silver stone walls, the jewelry and fine jewelry area showcases the house's latest collections in circular metal display cases. There is also an area dedicated to men, with large fitting rooms and two VIP rooms. Dotted with numerous art pieces by Frederic Heurlier-Cimolai, Adam Fuss, and Horst P. Horst, the boutique also unveils many pieces of furniture in bronze, brass, metal, and aluminum by the Voukenas Petrides studio, artist Audiane Delos, and Maison Leleu. One floor up, the house opens its VIP area around a huge terrace overlooking the Hollywood sign and its restaurant, Monsieur Dior. The space, whose menu has been designed by San Francisco's three-star chef Dominique Crenn, is set to open to the public in the last week of October. It features a lounge with a bar and an indoor-outdoor dining room that can accommodate up to 105 guests.

"Shulin, Danhai on shortlist for 50,000-seat dome in New Taipei City - Taipei Times","The New Taipei City Government today announced that a proposed 50,000-seat multipurpose domed stadium would be built in either Shulin District (樹林) or Danhai New Town (淡海新市真站), with the final location expected to be confirmed next year following detailed feasibility studies. Officials said that the Shulin No. 5 institutional-use site and the Danhai New Town Phase II site in Tamsui District (淡水) are suitable for the dome, which is to integrate smart services with facilities for sports, cultural performances and other entertainment. New Taipei City Deputy Mayor Liu Ho-jan (劉和然) said that the sites meet the key criteria identified by experts during a six-month evaluation, including having sufficient land for the project and convenient transportation access. The original shortlist also included sites near Shulin Sports Center, Shulin Daganyuan farmland, Sansia Maizihyuan farmland and the current Taipei Detention Center. Liu said that the New Taipei City Department of Sports has commissioned consultants to conduct in-depth evaluations covering financial feasibility, the project's impact on traffic and infrastructure planning. The Shulin site, near the borders of Shulin, Sinjhuang (新莊) and Banciao (板橋) districts, is adjacent to a planned MRT station on the future Wanda-Zhonghe-Shulin Line, allowing connections to multiple MRT lines and potential integration with the Shulin Railway Station. Highway access via Provincial Highway No. 65 connects to Freeways Nos. 1 and 3, making it a well-connected transportation hub fully under city management, Liu said. The Danhai site, located by the mountains and sea, was chosen for its tourism potential, he said. The newly completed Tamkang Bridge (淡江大橋) and the upcoming Tamsui Light Rail extension would further enhance accessibility, he added. The planned dome complex would cover about 23 hectares and include a stadium, parking, retail, hotels and entertainment facilities, Liu said.",Taipei Times,2025-10-01T09:14:15Z,https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2025/10/01/2003844747,2025-10-01 17:26:57.251765,0.003921568627450966

The Ultimate UK Guide to Organising Your Garden Shed for Winter - Shedblog.co.uk,"The Winter Shed Tidy: A Step-by-Step Guide to Decluttering & Clever Storage As the last of the autumn leaves fall and the air takes on a distinct chill, our attention turns inwards. We're stowing away garden furniture, pulling up the last of the vegetables, and battening down the hatches for the British winter. But before you lock the shed door until spring, there's one crucial task that promises peace of mind and a head start for next year: The Great Winter Shed Declutter. A disorganised shed isn't just an eyesore; it's a time-waster, a treasure-hider, and a potential hazard. This winter, transform your shed from a chaotic dumping ground into a serene, functional space. Welcome to the art of decluttering your garden shed. You might be tempted to put it off, but a pre-winter tidy offers tangible rewards: This is the most important step. You cannot organise clutter; you can only move it around. Set aside a dry day, put on a warm jumper, and get ready to be ruthless. Step 1: The Great Empty Pull everything out of the shed. Yes, everything. This is non-negotiable. Lay items out on a tarpaulin on the lawn (if it's dry) or in the garage. This action alone will reveal the scale of the task and the hidden contents of your shed. Step 2: The Four-Pile System As you empty, sort every single item into one of four categories: Step 3: The Deep Clean With the shed empty, take the opportunity to sweep out cobwebs, wipe down shelves, and check for signs of damp or pests. A quick hoover and a wipe with a mild disinfectant can work wonders. This is also the perfect time to consider adding a moisture-absorbing product like a shed dehumidifier or even just a tub of salt to combat winter damp. Now for the satisfying part: putting it all back, but with purpose and clever storage solutions. Think in terms of ""zones"" to create a logical, efficient layout. Zone 1: The Tool Wall - Getting Things Off the Floor Floor space is prime real estate. Use your walls! Zone 2: Overhead Storage - Utilising the Ceiling The ceiling is often the most under-utilised space. Zone 3: Shelving & Containers - The Power of Being Sealed Shelves are the backbone of shed organisation. If you have old, warped wooden shelves, consider upgrading to sturdy metal shelving units which are less prone to damp and more resilient. Once everything is in its place, do one last check. Are sharp tools safely stored? Have you disposed of any old, hazardous chemicals properly? Is the lock secure? Then, close the door. You can now face the winter months knowing that your gardening sanctuary is not just stored, but curated. The art of decluttering isn't about creating a sterile, unused space; it's about creating a space that serves you perfectly. When the first snowdrops appear and the days begin to lengthen, you'll be able to step back into a shed that welcomes the new season with open, beautifully organised, arms. Happy organising",ShedBlog #shedoftheyear 2025,2025-10-01T08:23:54Z,https://www.shedblog.co.uk/2025/10/01/the-ultimate-uk-guide-to-organising-your-garden-shed-for-winter/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.252650,0.3254901960784313
Editorial: Clemson's short-sighted handling of historic vegetable lab bears no fruit,"Clemson University should be embarrassed that it operates a historic preservation program in downtown Charleston while, only 10 miles away, it's neglecting buildings eligible for the National Register of Historic Places to the point they soon could become irreparable. The cluster of deteriorating buildings at Clemson's Coastal Research and Education Center has several deteriorating structures among its 325 acres along Savannah Highway. Many date from the 1930s when the U.S. Department of Agriculture chose this then-very-rural area for the first of nine crop research facilities across the nation. As The Post and Courier's Jason Ryan reported, a two-story brick building -- the most prominent on the site -- has been covered with vines, weeds and grime and is missing parts of its roof, as dormers slough into the attic. It's a sad story about how the school's lack of internal communication and imagination threatens the future of a site that speaks to the state's rich agricultural history. For almost a century, the USDA and Clemson have been partners in agricultural research in this area, and around 2003, they moved across Savannah Highway into a new, more spacious U.S. Vegetable Laboratory building. That turning point marked the abandonment and decline of the older buildings, especially the original vegetable laboratory. Clemson's agricultural officials probably thought they were doing the right thing by reaching a 2018 agreement with the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Office and the federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to accept ownership of the federal property on the condition that the school be allowed to tear down the lab buildings it no longer found useful for its agricultural research work. But that decision was short-sighted in many respects, as it didn't loop in the city of Charleston, which is increasingly interested in preserving not only its oldest and most historic buildings downtown but also other structures that tell the story of the city's growth and evolution during the 20th century. The city turned back the school's 2020 request for demolition of the vegetable lab and sent Clemson a letter a month ago urging temporary repairs to slow further degradation. Clemson's decision was also short-sighted because it didn't consider the buildings' potential for further use. Only a few years after it sought the city's permission to raze the headhouse and greenhouses, the new director of Clemson's coastal center found a new use for them, a change of heart that scuttled a nascent, private effort to move them to a new site in Colleton County. Such a move would have been a partial preservation victory at best because it would have divorced the structures from their historic setting. But the biggest problem with the demolition plan was that Clemson weighed only its agricultural mission, ignoring a larger mission that includes instruction in historic preservation. Yes, it would be challenging to find a new use for the crumbling vegetable lab on the site, but historic preservation success often involves thinking outside the box, as preservation students undoubtedly are taught. Clemson's neglect reminds us of the University of South Carolina's ongoing struggles with The Wedge, a historic plantation home in northern Charleston County that the university bought years ago for use as a research station but has since struggled to maintain after deciding to close it. Demolition by neglect of historic buildings is always sad, but when the building is owned by a public body, it's worse. As arms of our government, these public owners should set an example by preserving the history that makes our state the special place it is. The city has asked Clemson to make temporary repairs and submit a rehabilitation-preservation plan by September 2026. It will be more embarrassing if the school waits that long to comply. for more opinion content from The Post and Courier.",Post and Courier,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.postandcourier.com/opinion/editorials/clemson-vegetable-lab-neglected-research-center/article_24b2dee4-de08-42a5-8619-ec765324186c.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.253075,-0.1137254901960785

Making Rupee Global: RBI Makes It Easier For Foreigners To Invest In India  --  Here's How,"The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday announced a slew of measures to promote the internationalisation of the rupee. These include allowing foreigners to invest money stored in rupee vostro accounts in corporate bonds. ""We have been making steady progress in the use of Indian Rupee for international trade. Three measures are proposed in this regard,"" Governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Wednesday. Under the initiative, banks that are authorised to deal in foreign exchange transactions will be permitted to lend in Indian rupee to non-residents from Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka for cross border trade transactions. This means NRIs running businessess in these neighbouring countries will be able to raise working capital or fresh funds from Indian banks. Several large Indian lenders like State Bank of India have branches in these countries. The RBI will establish transparent reference rates for currencies of India's major trading partners to facilitate INR based transactions. The central bank is looking at the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), among others to establish reference rates, T Rabi Shankar, part time Member of Sixteenth Finance Commission and RBI Deputy Governor, said in a press conference. ""The objective is to reduce crossing currencies to get rates. We have to work out ways to set a benchmark reference rate,"" he said.

Port inefficiencies stifling competitiveness - Chamber of Shipping,"Persistent congestion, high costs and operational inefficiencies at Ghana's seaports are undermining trade and investment and weakening the country's competitiveness, according to Jemilat Mahamah, Vice President of the Ghana Chamber of Shipping. Addressing the Maritime Transport Stakeholders Forum in Tema, she said that unless transparency and efficiency are made central to port reforms, Ghana risks losing ground in regional and global trade. ""Our maritime sector stands as a gateway to regional trade and a cornerstone of our national economy. Yet, the challenges surrounding port congestion, operational inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and high costs have hindered the full realisation of our maritime potential,"" she noted. The forum, convened under the theme 'Streamlining Ghana's Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector for Transparency, Efficiency and Competitiveness', brought together officials from the transport ministry, private operators, regulators, and civil society to examine reforms aimed at strengthening port performance. She stressed that the economic toll of inefficiencies extended beyond Ghana's borders. Tema and Takoradi ports handle the vast majority of the country's seaborne trade, with Tema alone processing about 80 percent of all imports and exports. Both ports also serve as gateways for landlocked neighbours including Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, making their performance critical to regional supply chains. ""These issues not only stifle trade and investment but also diminish Ghana's standing in the African Continental Free Trade Area and the global marketplace,"" she said. She identified transparency as a critical tool for reversing the trend, arguing that openness in port operations would enhance regulatory compliance, reduce costs, and encourage innovation. ""The nexus between transparency and shipping efficiency is one of a positive correlation,"" she told attendees. ""Together, these effects reduce costs, improve sustainability, and increase customer satisfaction, fundamentally transforming shipping performance,"" she added. Discussions at the forum centred on port modernisation, the deployment of digital tools such as the Port Community System, and policy frameworks intended to improve accountability. Industry leaders were expected to share experiences and propose strategies for tackling the high costs and delays that continue to burden shippers and businesses. Mahamah urged stakeholders to take a proactive role in shaping reforms, warning that the nation's maritime transport system could not sustain inefficiencies if it was to compete effectively. ""Your insights, experiences, and commitments are vital to shaping a maritime landscape that not only serves the economy efficiently but also attracts sustainable investment and unleashes new economic opportunities for Ghanaians,"" she said. She further called for collective resolve to reposition Ghana's ports as efficient and competitive trade gateways capable of delivering long-term economic benefits.

"B Lab Africa Summit 2025 to Feature High-Level Panel Discussions on Agriculture, Green Finance, Education, Technology and Renewable Energy - Sandton Lifestyle Magazine","The 4th Annual B Lab Africa Summit, taking place on 2-3 October 2025 at the Serengeti Golf and Wildlife Estate in Johannesburg, will convene policymakers, business leaders, academics, and innovators to address Africa's readiness to take decisive action on climate, inclusive growth, and sustainability. A central feature of the Summit will be five panel discussions designed to provide practical insights and highlight African-led solutions to some of the continent's most urgent development priorities. Agriculture remains Africa's largest source of livelihoods, employing more than 60% of the population. Yet, it faces rising challenges of food insecurity, climate variability, and land degradation. This panel will explore how the sector can transition from subsistence to sustainability by balancing food security, regenerative practices, and profitability. It will also address how agribusiness and smallholder farmers can play a central role in Africa's economic growth story. Unlocking Green Finance for SMEs & Navigating Trade Africa requires an estimated $277 billion annually until 2030 to implement climate solutions, yet access to finance remains limited for SMEs, the backbone of Africa's economy. This session will focus on the capital flows required for Africa's green transition, exploring innovative financing mechanisms, blended finance, and trade facilitation that can open pathways for small and medium enterprises to access billions in climate and trade-related finance. Educating the Future By 2050, Africa will be home to the world's largest youth population. However, a mismatch between education systems and labour market needs persists. This panel will examine how to reshape education and skills development to equip young Africans for the jobs of the future, including those in green industries and digital economies. It will also highlight partnerships between governments, private sector players, and educational institutions that are redefining workforce readiness. Data & Technology - Securing Sustainability Through AI From precision agriculture to smart energy grids, technology and artificial intelligence are emerging as tools to accelerate Africa's sustainable development. This panel will explore how data and AI can democratise access to opportunities, increase accountability, and strengthen governance, while also safeguarding against risks such as bias and unequal access. The session will focus on Africa-specific use cases where technology is being deployed to secure inclusive, sustainable growth. Powering the Transition - Renewable Energy for a Resilient Africa More than 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity, while climate impacts continue to threaten energy security. This discussion will showcase African-led renewable energy solutions from solar and wind to mini-grids that are enabling resilience, driving industrialisation, and expanding inclusive energy access. It will also assess the role of policy, investment and innovation in powering Africa's transition to a climate-resilient energy future. ""These panel discussions are designed not only to debate but to drive tangible action,"" said Lucy Muigai, CEO of B Lab Africa. ""Each session will draw on African realities, opportunities, and leadership, ensuring the continent's growth story is anchored in sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity."" The B Lab Africa Summit is widely regarded as a premier platform for businesses, investors, and policymakers committed to building an equitable and sustainable Africa. Through these high-level discussions, participants will gain deeper insights into solutions shaping the continent's future and have the opportunity to collaborate on pathways for change.",Sandton Lifestyle Magazine,2025-10-01T09:02:40Z,https://sandtonlifestylemagazine.co.za/2025/10/01/b-lab-africa-summit-2025-to-feature-high-level-panel-discussions-on-agriculture-green-finance-education-technology-and-renewable-energy/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.254012,0.2627450980392156

SILVER BULL PROVIDES UPDATE ON ITS ARBITRATION CASE AGAINST MEXICO - Silver Bull Resources (OTC:SVBL),"OTCQB: SVBL, TSX: SVB VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 1, 2025 /CNW/ - Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (""Silver Bull"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that the hearing for its Arbitration case against the United States of Mexico (""Mexico"") will commence on October 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C., and will conclude no later than October 11, 2025. As reported in Silver Bull's June 29, 2023 news release, the Company commenced international arbitration proceedings against Mexico under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA"") and the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""). The arbitration has been initiated under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States process, which falls under the auspices of the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (""ICSID""), to which Mexico is a signatory. The arbitration arises from Mexico's refusal to take action with respect to the illegal blockade of Silver Bull's Sierra Mojada Project, which commenced in September 2019 and remains ongoing. Silver Bull is represented in these proceedings by Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (""BSF""), a leading international law firm with extensive experience in investor-state arbitration and is financially supported by Bench Walk Advisors LLC via a Litigation Funding Agreement for up to US$9.5 million to finance the case and the running of the Company. The Management of Silver Bull is confident in its legal position and looks forward to presenting its case at the upcoming hearing in Washington, D.C. On completion of the hearing, it is customary for an Arbitration Tribunal to deliver its findings within approximately six months following the hearing, although this timing may vary. BACKGROUND TO THE CLAIM: Silver Bull officially notified Mexico on March 2, 2023 of its intention to initiate an arbitration owing to Mexico's breaches of NAFTA by unlawfully expropriating Silver Bull's investments without compensation, failing to provide Silver Bull and its investments with fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security, and not upholding NAFTA's national treatment standard. Silver Bull held a meeting with Mexican government officials in Mexico City on May 30, 2023, in an attempt to explore amicable settlement options and avoid arbitration. However, the 90-day period for amicable settlement under NAFTA expired on June 2, 2023, without a resolution. Despite repeated demands and requests for action by the Company, Mexico's governmental agencies have allowed the unlawful blockade to continue to this day, thereby failing to protect Silver Bull's investment. THE SIERRA MOJADA DEPOSIT: Silver Bull's only asset is the Sierra Mojada deposit located in Coahuila, Mexico. Sierra Mojada is an open pittable oxide deposit with a NI 43-101 compliant Measured and Indicated ""global"" Mineral Resource of 70.4 million tonnes grading 3.4% zinc and 38.6 g/t silver for 5.35 billion pounds of contained zinc and 87.4 million ounces of contained silver. Included within the ""global"" Mineral Resource is a Measured and Indicated ""high grade zinc zone"" of 13.5 million tonnes with an average grade of 11.2% zinc at a 6% cutoff, for 3.336 billion pounds of contained zinc, and a Measured and Indicated ""high grade silver zone"" of 15.2 million tonnes with an average grade of 114.9 g/t silver at a 50 g/t cutoff for 56.3 million contained ounces of silver. Mineralization remains open in the east, west, and northerly directions.

The Bullish Case for Pepesnix in 2025,"Every bull run has its standout tokens, and in 2025, Pepesnix is quickly becoming one of the most bullish stories in crypto. With a presale raising over $500,000, viral social media presence, and sustainable tokenomics, Pepesnix is catching the attention of both retail investors and analysts. But what exactly is driving the bullish case for $PEPEX this year? Presale Momentum Builds Confidence Pepesnix's presale has been nothing short of explosive. Selling out stages rapidly and attracting thousands of participants, it's clear that retail investors are taking notice. Early momentum often sets the tone for meme coin success, and Pepesnix has already checked that box. Why Analysts Are Bullish Analysts highlight several reasons why Pepesnix is positioned for major growth in 2025: Strong tokenomics -- Anti-whale protections, liquidity allocations, and staking rewards support both fairness and stability. Community-driven growth -- A rapidly expanding base on Telegram, Twitter, and TikTok. Market timing -- Launching as the broader crypto market heats up, increasing retail appetite. Marketing reserves -- Ensuring hype and awareness don't fade after launch. Together, these elements create a strong foundation for bullish predictions. The Role of Community Meme coins are powered by people, and Pepesnix is already proving itself with one of the most active communities in 2025. Memes, viral contests, and influencer engagement are spreading awareness faster than most new tokens could dream of. For many investors, this organic energy is a key bullish signal. Potential Exchange Listings Ahead Another factor adding to bullish sentiment is speculation around exchange listings. If Pepesnix secures spots on mid-tier or top-tier exchanges, liquidity and visibility could expand dramatically. History shows that listings often act as major catalysts for meme coin rallies. Comparisons With Past Meme Coin Rallies Dogecoin went from a joke to a top-10 coin. Shiba Inu built an entire ecosystem and rewarded early investors with life-changing gains. Pepe dominated headlines in 2023. Pepesnix could be the 2025 version of this cycle, offering both meme appeal and structured fundamentals. Risks Still Apply Of course, bullish cases should always be balanced with caution. Meme coins are volatile, and hype can fade. However, Pepesnix has put safeguards in place that give it a stronger chance of sustaining growth than many of its peers. The Bottom Line The bullish case for Pepesnix in 2025 is clear: presale momentum, viral community growth, strong tokenomics, and perfect market timing. While risks remain, Pepesnix stands out as one of the most promising meme coins of the year. For investors looking to ride the bullish wave, Pepesnix may be the opportunity they've been waiting for. 👉 Learn more and join the presale at pepesnix.com Related Items:",TechBullion,2025-10-01T09:13:25Z,https://techbullion.com/the-bullish-case-for-pepesnix-in-2025/,2025-10-01 17:26:57.255128,0.3333333333333333

"Ghanaian man shares what he found during apartment search, says it left him drained","Ghana's top stories, now easier to find. Discover our new search feature! A young Ghanaian man decided to document his deeply disappointing and ultimately unsuccessful 'apartment hunting day'. Taking to his TikTok page, the young man, identified as Fredrick Osei, shared his frustrating experience of viewing several apartments that fell far short of his expectations. Because of the ordeal, he declared that day as the 'day one and day last' of searching for an apartment. In the video, he visited a two-bedroom apartment in a neighbourhood he apparently found disgusting, with its rundown and cluttered surroundings. He also found the apartment itself to be extremely small, particularly the bedrooms and bathrooms. The second apartment, also a two-bedroom, was similar to its equally cramped rooms. Visibly confused and disappointed, he questioned why anyone would expect him to live in such conditions and firmly rejected it. His search took a different turn when he found a much nicer-looking three-bedroom apartment, only to be left surprised at the price. Exhausted and defeated, he concluded his hunt and decided to go home, ending the video with a simple, 'I'm tired. Bye.' The video has captured the common frustrations of house-hunting in Ghana, from subpar living conditions to exorbitant rental prices. Watch the video of the man sharing his apartment journey hunting below: In a similar report, a Ghanaian lady called out her prospective landlord for failing on his side of their negotiation regarding her apartment. The lady was filled with frustration as she bashed her prospective landlord for not completing essential renovations on the apartment she paid for.

However, she explained that over a month later, the homeowner had still not completed the renovations, despite taking her money readily. In her words: ""When we got there, he hadn't done anything. The house we are supposed to move into... My pastor was going to come and pray over it, but he hasn't done any of the renovation work.

"Sabah polls: Warisan denies 'secret pact' with BN, says it will contest all seats","KOTA KINABALU: Parti Warisan is denying allegations it has a ""secret pact"" with Barisan Nasional and insists that the party will contest all 73 seats in the upcoming state election. Warisan legal advisor Chin Tek Ming described the claim by former Sabah Bersatu deputy chief Aksyah Nasrah as a ""work of fiction"". ""The claim of a secret pact between Warisan and Barisan is an outright lie,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday (Oct 1). ""Warisan president Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal has made it clear that the party will contest all 73 state seats independently. Our only pact is with the people of Sabah, not any political party,"" he said. Chin said Aksyah, who has since pledged allegiance to Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), was not speaking as a neutral observer but as ""a political operative for a rival coalition."" Warisan secretary-general Datuk Loretto Padua Jr also hit back at GRS, accusing its leaders of hypocrisy over claims that Warisan had worked with Umno to topple the state government. Loretto said GRS had never received a direct mandate from voters in the 16th Sabah Election, pointing out that many of its leaders, including Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor and Nizam Abu Bakar Titingan, won their seats under Bersatu. He also accused GRS of striking ""secret deals"" involving the state's natural resources. ""There is no secret agreement or collaboration between Warisan and Umno,"" he said.",The Star ,2025-10-01T09:13:23Z,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/10/01/sabah-polls-warisan-denies-039secret-pact039-with-bn-says-it-will-contest-all-seats,2025-10-01 17:26:57.255917,0.1607843137254903
"Autumn Budget uncertainty weighing on consumer confidence, Taylor Wimpey says","The Buckinghamshire-based housebuilder nonetheless said it was ready to lean in to the 'pressing need' for new homes in the UK. Taylor Wimpey has reported a dip in sales activity over recent months as it flagged the upcoming autumn Budget as adding to concerns weighing on homebuyer confidence. The Buckinghamshire-based housebuilder nonetheless said it was ready to lean into the ""pressing need"" for new homes in the UK. It reported a net private sales rate of 0.65 per outlet per week in the nine weeks to September 28 - an indicator of the average number of homes sold at each of its development sites. This was lower than the 0.7 rate recorded over the same period last year. At the end of the period, its total order book value was £2.12 billion - down slightly from £2.15 billion last year. Taylor Wimpey told investors it was on track to meet its target of completing the sale of between 10,400 and 10,800 homes over 2025, and generating a operating profit of about £424 million. However, the company said it was ""mindful of the various issues impacting customer sentiment and propensity to buy homes, including the impact of the delayed UK Budget on short term customer confidence"". Rachel Reeves will set out her annual Budget statement on November 26. Pressure on the Chancellor to raise money to balance the books has led to speculation that she could raise taxes, such as through changes to inheritance tax and capital gains tax rules. Reports have also said that she may consider an overhaul of property tax, or a move to impose national insurance on landlords' rental income. Uncertainty over the changes could be prompting potential home buyers to delay their purchases in the short term, some estate agents have suggested. It follows new figures from Nationwide Building Society on Wednesday showing the average UK house price increased by 0.5% in September, compared with the previous month, following a 0.1% monthly fall in August. Nationwide said it shows that underlying conditions for potential home buyers were positive despite uncertainties about the economy, and that housing market activity was likely to gradually strengthen. Taylor Wimpey said it remains ""confident in the underlying fundamentals of the UK housing market, with its pressing need for new homes"", as well as its ability to improve its own profits.",The Independent,2025-10-01T09:05:16Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/taylor-wimpey-autumn-budget-rachel-reeves-buckinghamshire-chancellor-b2837088.html,2025-10-01 17:26:57.256142,0.1607843137254903
PA MEDI can help take the mystery out of Medicare,"The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) is a national program set up to assist those eligible for Medicare as they navigate Medicare enrollment, coverage, options and other issues. In Pennsylvania, this program is called Pennsylvania Medicare Education and Decision Insight (PA MEDI). The Chester County PA MEDI program is staffed with a coordinator and volunteer counselors. Our local program coordinator and volunteer counselors operate within the Chester County Department of Aging. The counselors provide free, unbiased, confidential guidance with one-on-one counseling. Counselors are the key to the program. To become a PA MEDI counselor, the volunteer must pass a background check and go through a certification process that includes online training modules, classroom instruction, a competency exam and a period of working with a mentor before counseling clients on their own. Once certified, training continues with monthly meetings, webinars and regional updates. The counselors come from varied backgrounds and areas of expertise. ""Michael was phenomenal in helping me get my Medicare coverage in a very timely manner after I was having communication issues with Social Security Administration,"" said a client who received one-on-one counseling. Individuals have three different opportunities to enroll in Medicare. It is important to know the enrollment timelines for Medicare. People who have been collecting Social Security benefits before turning 65 will automatically be enrolled in Part A and Part B of Medicare upon turning 65. After the 24th month of Social Security disability, Medicare enrollment is also automatic. Otherwise, enrollment is required and should occur within the 7-month period surrounding the 65th birthday (3 months before, the month of the 65th birthday and 3 months after). This is the Initial Enrollment Period (IEP). There are two other opportunities for Medicare enrollment. These are SEPs and the GEP. A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) is available if leaving employer coverage after working beyond Medicare eligibility. If a beneficiary misses the IEP and an SEP, there is a General Enrollment Period (GEP) each year from Jan. 1 - March 31. Each enrollment period has different rules, which can be confusing. PA MEDI counselors are acquainted with these enrollment periods and the rules for each. Counselors can help beneficiaries understand what applies to their individual situations. There are still some important decisions to make even when Medicare enrollment has been completed. At the time of Medicare eligibility beneficiaries may want to consider options for help with medical expenses, such as a Medigap policy, a Medicare Advantage Plan and a Part D Prescription Plan. PA MEDI counselors can provide detailed information on all these options. Counselors have access to an actuarial website that provides important Medigap considerations, such as pricing, that are not usually included in the advertising brochures flooding your mail and inbox. During personalized, one-on-one counseling sessions, clients are routinely screened for eligibility for government assistance programs such as Medicaid, Extra Help, Medicare Savings Program, and PACE. Counselors will provide assistance with applications for these programs, if needed. ""I'm researching Medigap and Part D plans for my sister and have some questions as the medicare.gov is a bit confusing,"" one client said. In-person, one-on-one counseling takes place at local senior centers or other community sites. We can also counsel beneficiaries by phone or Zoom. Counseling is available year-round, but the busiest time is during the Annual Open Enrollment Period (AOEP) from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. One-on-one sessions during the AOEP include a review of Prescription Drug Plans and Medicare Advantage Plans using the Medicare website Plan Finder tool. These reviews may help beneficiaries find a new plan that can save hundreds, even thousands, of dollars over the course of the year. ""For the past two years you have been of great assistance with helping me to enroll in Medicare Part D Prescription Plans,"" said one client. ""Your assistance has saved me at least several thousand dollars this past year. ""Thanks so much for all your time and patience with us as we navigated the Medicare Part D world with you. Your knowledgeable assistance is the reason we are able to save money and understand the process so that we can make the necessary decisions -- we can't thank you enough."" Counselors help clients with all kinds of issues and questions related to Medicare coverage: understanding a bill, what procedures are covered, how to change plans when moving, how to file an appeal when a service has been denied, how to apply for some of the assistance programs. Quite often PA MEDI counselors are asked to help with difficult situations. These might involve issues of lost coverage, inadequate coverage or inability to get coverage. PA MEDI has direct contact with other agencies. ""I am beyond frustrated,"" one client said. ""I have been unsuccessful after multiple times trying. At one point it (the Social Security website) locked me out."" Group presentations are also available in the community at local libraries, churches and senior centers. Attendance at these presentations is by reservation only. The schedule and instructions for registration are available at https://www.chesco.org/calendar.aspx?CID=22 You can also call the Help Line for information at 610-344-5004, Option 2. ""Medicare 101"" is a presentation for individuals becoming eligible for Medicare and provides a great opportunity to learn the basics of enrollment and coverage. People who attend a Medicare 101 presentation ask more informed questions at their one-on-one sessions. ""Medicare 102"" is especially informative for those already enrolled in Medicare. ""Medicare 102"" presentations include such topics as Medicare-covered preventive services, outpatient therapy, home health services, medical equipment, diabetic supplies, fraud prevention and more. "" Medicare Open Enrollment -- Fine Tune Your Medicare"" presentations help to make beneficiaries aware of changes that can be made during the Medicare Annual Open Enrollment Period to get the most out of Medicare during the next year. ""You have such a great way of presenting the information which really helps to reduce one's anxiety over trying to figure out the complex world of Medicare,"" a client said about the presentations. ""Very thorough."" ""I know what to do now,"" said another. ""Better than expected."" The overriding goal for our PA MEDI program is to educate and provide information that gives Medicare beneficiaries the tools to better understand and navigate their medical coverage, ultimately to have best access to their care. Contact for PA MEDI can be by phone on our Help Line (610-344-5004, Option 2) or by email (smilam@chesco.org). Counselors pick up these messages daily and return calls within one business day. The website www.chesco.org/477/PA-MEDI has a collection of articles and newsletters with information on many topics relating to Medicare.

Global Markets React to US Government Shutdown | Business,"US futures and global markets show mixed reactions following the onset of a US government shutdown. While US markets saw a minor drop, Asian and European indices displayed varied trends. The political situation in Japan and financial adjustments in China added further layers of complexity to the market dynamics. On Wednesday, US futures dipped alongside a mixed performance in global markets as a US government shutdown commenced. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%. Despite the downturn, both indices had reached record highs a day earlier. European markets reflected a similar caution, with Germany's DAX down 0.3% and France's CAC 40 decreasing by 0.1%. In contrast, Britain's FTSE rose 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a decline of 0.9% due to political uncertainty as the country awaits a new prime minister. Meanwhile, China's financial activity slows during a National Day holiday, though plans for a reverse repo operation aim to boost liquidity post-holiday. In the broader market landscape, the ongoing US government shutdown has left investors wary, as international markets adjust to potential ripple effects. Despite historical precedents of minimal economic impact from shutdowns, concerns linger over its implications on Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions and US employment data releases.",Devdiscourse,2025-10-01T09:11:01Z,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3648491-global-markets-react-to-us-government-shutdown,2025-10-01 17:26:59.717297,0.01960784313725483
UPI transactions will continue to remain free,"Reserve Bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday said there is no proposal to levy any charge on UPI transactions. Illustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff The governor also said the central bank is examining a proposal to allow lenders to remotely lock mobile phones bought on credit in case of default in EMI payments. While responding to a question whether there is a proposal to levy charges on UPI transactions, which have gone up significantly, Malhotra said there was no such proposal. ""Is there going to be charges on UPI? Well, there is no proposal before us,"" he said at a post-monetary policy press conference. On digital locking of phones bought on credit, the governor said the matter was under consideration. RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao added that both pros and cons regarding the digital locking of phones are being examined. ""The issue of digital locking is under examination as the Governor has pointed out. ""There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and creditors' requirements. ""So, we are examining the issue, we will...take a view at a later point in time,"" Rao said. During the press conference, Malhotra and other deputy governors replied to a host of queries, including on rate cut possibilities in forthcoming polices, and rupee depreciation. On the rate cut, the governor said inflation has dropped considerably, providing space for monetary easing. On the depreciating value of the rupee against the US dollar, he said the central bank does not target any level or band, but only tries to check undue volatility. Malhotra also exuded confidence that the very high GDP growth trajectory will continue with price stability, and private capital expenditure will pick up. He said the RBI raised the GDP growth projection to 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent because of good economic activities in the first half of 2025-26.",Rediff.com India Ltd.,2025-10-01T09:12:52Z,https://www.rediff.com/business/report/upi-transactions-will-continue-to-remain-free/20251001.htm,2025-10-01 17:26:59.717590,-0.01960784313725494
"RBI's steady and cautious outlook gives confidence to businesses, investors: Industry chambers","NEW DELHI: Leading industry chambers on Wednesday expressed delight on the RBI's move to keep the repo rate steady at 5.5 per cent with a 'neutral' stance, saying that this shows a balanced approach to supporting growth while keeping an eye on inflation. After the earlier 100 bps rate cut this year, the RBI's steady and cautious outlook gives confidence to businesses, investors, and the broader economy. ""By balancing the twin objectives of growth and price stability, the policy sends out a reassuring signal to businesses and investors. Stable interest rates will help corporates plan long-term investments with greater clarity, while providing comfort to consumers through predictable borrowing costs, "" said Assocham President, Sanjay Nayar. Key sectors such as banking, infrastructure and automobiles are expected to benefit from steady demand conditions, backed by a conducive financing environment. ""This move also reinforces confidence in India's macroeconomic resilience and its ability to attract global capital, "" Nayar mentioned. Further, for commodity-linked industries, the policy signals stability as the RBI's neutral approach reduces the risk of immediate rate hikes. This will help moderate input cost pressures and support consumption-led demand in sectors like FMCG, infrastructure and manufacturing. The decision also provides clarity for investors, strengthening confidence in India's growth outlook. The RBI's decision reinforces India's economic stability, sending a positive signal to global partners like the US. While it doesn't directly affect trade tariffs, steady policy strengthens investor confidence and supports efforts to enhance bilateral trade and investment ties.",punjabnewsexpress.com,2025-10-01T09:12:47Z,https://www.punjabnewsexpress.com/business/news/rbis-steady-and-cautious-outlook-gives-confidence-to-businesses-investors-industry-chambers-300049,2025-10-01 17:26:59.717831,0.5058823529411764
Economic Watch: China's high-standard opening up bolsters appeal of capital market,"BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- China has been steadily expanding institutional opening of its capital market during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), with a series of targeted measures implemented to enhance its appeal to global investors and facilitate high-quality development. Over this period, the number of foreign-controlled securities, funds and futures companies has grown significantly, with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approving 13 additional foreign-controlled firms in these sectors. The number of Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) had expanded to almost 907 by the end of August, with their holdings of Chinese shares valued at 949.3 billion yuan (about 133.6 billion U.S. dollars). According to the newly disclosed data for the second quarter of 2025, the total market value of northbound funds has reached 2.29 trillion yuan, up more than 2 percent from the previous quarter. This flow of capital coincides with the latest survey on emerging market investment intent from the HSBC Global Investment Research. It shows that among many emerging markets, the Chinese stock market has become the first choice for global institutional investors. More than half of the respondents said they were most optimistic about the outlook for the mainland stock market, a significantly higher proportion than the approximately one-third reported at the time of the June survey. ""These figures demonstrate the positive outcomes of China's capital market opening up,"" said Zhao Xijun, a finance professor at Renmin University of China. ""It not only allows foreign institutions to fully leverage their strengths in cross-border services but also introduces international expertise to enhance market vitality, while enabling global capital to share the dividends of China's high-quality development."" Behind these impressive results lies the sustained momentum of the policy package. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, a series of targeted measures have taken effect, both improving the convenience of foreign investment and providing institutional guarantees for high-standard financial opening up. For example, recent years have witnessed the complete removal of foreign ownership limits on financial institutions, the improvement of the QFII system, and the expansion of the varieties of derivatives in which qualified foreign institutional investors can participate within commodity futures and options trading. Moreover, the CSRC plans to collaborate with the People's Bank of China to study and promote the trading of RMB foreign exchange futures. Global investors believe these measures are enabling them to more smoothly and fully share in China's innovation-driven development opportunities. ""UBS was the first foreign institution to obtain the QFII qualification. Leveraging this advantage, we have actively engaged with global investors through platforms like Stock Connect and QFII,"" said Thomas Fang, head of China global markets at UBS. He added that A-shares are expected to maintain a steady and positive trend both in terms of valuations and market attention, as policies continue to strengthen while the external environment becomes clearer. Additionally, during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the CSRC announced five measures to bolster Hong Kong's role as an international financial center, while optimizing mechanisms such as Stock Connect and mutual recognition of funds. Ying Weiping, chairman of Trans International Finance, said, ""The policy package has achieved two-way empowerment between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong capital markets. On one hand, connectivity mechanisms have allowed Hong Kong to better meet the mainland's demand for cross-border capital allocation; on the other hand, Hong Kong's role as a 'bridge to the world' has enabled international capital to enter the mainland market more smoothly."" Looking forward, market participants expect the institutional opening up of China's capital market to advance to deeper levels and broader areas. Measures focusing on enhancing connectivity, strengthening risk prevention and control, and other key areas will be rolled out sequentially to boost the global competitiveness of Chinese assets. The recent approval of qualified foreign investors to participate in on-exchange ETF options trading from Oct. 9 represents another significant step forward. While advancing opening up, China remains committed to preventing and controlling financial risks. Guan Tao, an economist with BOC International, emphasized the importance of improving macro-prudential management of cross-border capital flows, enhancing monitoring and assessment systems and exploring the introduction of price-based management tools. ■",english.news.cn,2025-10-01T09:12:48Z,https://english.news.cn/20251001/1500301f0aa647feb98db8f95c9b06c5/c.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.718430,0.3254901960784313
Boom: the company leading Africa into a golden age of decentralised finance and sovereign AI,"This article was produced with the support of Boom Technologies On a bustling afternoon in Accra, Yao scrolls through his phone while sipping roasted coffee. He smiles as a pair of handmade shoes from Paris lands in his virtual cart. A few taps later - paid entirely in Ghanaian cedis - the order is confirmed. Across the continent in Nairobi, Monica finalises a payment to her supplier in Abidjan. Within seconds, the funds transfer in local currencies. No banks, no delays, no intermediaries. This is not a vision of the future - it is Boom Technologies Ltd, a 100% African-owned company, that is transforming Africa and the world, into a seamlessly connected single digital marketplace without a single currency. Africa has long been caught in a financial paradox. Most daily transactions occur offline and in cash, yet the global economy thrives online. Today, over one billion adults and businesses remain unbanked, unable to access the tools needed for digital commerce. At the same time, £25 trillion in physical cash sits idle outside the banking system - untapped and unproductive. The IMF estimates that 90% of transactions in emerging markets still take place in cash, leaving millions excluded from credit, investment and cross-border trade. Intra-African commerce faces its own barriers. Africans seldom accept each other's currencies, relying instead on US dollars for cross-border payments. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), created to solve this challenge, has so far signed up 17 countries. Yet even if all 44 central banks in Africa adopted it, PAPSS would still only serve the small fraction of transactions processed through the banking system - leaving the vast majority of cash-first users excluded. Add to this a deep distrust of banks. Many Africans prefer to custody their own cash, but that comes with risks: theft, portability issues, limited cross-border acceptance and no ability to transact online. Founded by Nigerian-born technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye and funded with his own $133m in seed capital, Boom was created to make cash as powerful as digital money. Boom is a decentralised financial market infrastructure that allows anyone to spend cash online, worldwide, without needing a bank account. ""Boom is the world's decentralised financial operating system, unlocking access to $1,000 trillion in real-world assets, while enabling value exchange across currencies, commodities and securities - without banks, borders, or permission,"" says Alfred-Adekeye. ""We have built the software infrastructure for Africa's golden age of commerce."" For Yao in Ghana, Boom means he can buy from European brands using local currency. For Monica in Kenya, it means paying suppliers in Abidjan instantly and securely - no dollar conversions, no friction. At the heart of this innovation is Boom's seven-layer decentralised finance (DeFi) stack, anchored by the Boom blockchain at Layer 1, the Boom Superapp at Layer 4 and developer-friendly APIs at Layer 7. This architecture allows users to control their funds while enabling instant, cross-border payments in local currencies. The Boom Superapp is a Web3-powered platform designed with a seamless Web2 user experience. Already available in 15 African languages including Arabic, Yoruba, Amharic, Swahili, Lingala, Igbo, Zulu, Hausa and more (with plans to expand to 300), it combines: Boom's credibility was strengthened in 2023 when it successfully collaborated with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) - the central bank of central banks - through Project Rosalind, led by the Bank of England. This partnership positioned Boom not only as a regional disruptor but also as a trusted player in shaping the future of global payments. At the core of Boom's financial layer lies Boomcoin (BMC), the world's only sovereign-grade digital currency with built-in compliance. Every Boomcoin is transparently KYC-traceable from the genesis memory block to today, exceeding AML/CTF standards and providing regulators, institutions and merchants with unmatched confidence. The Foundation's Boomcoin-to-Meals programme has already airdropped BMC to thousands of Nigerians suffering food insecurity, enabling them to purchase essentials directly in the Superapp. ""Boomcoin is the Bitcoin for everyday commerce globally - built for utility, inclusion and social good,"" Alfred-Adekeye explains. With on-chain credit scoring, financial institutions can extend loans, insurance and credit directly within the app, driving financial inclusion across Africa. Boom's ambition stretches far beyond payments. Its PhotonAI initiative tackles Africa's existential challenge: the lack of sovereign AI infrastructure. Currently, Africa contributes less than 1% of global AI training data and lacks large-scale compute power, leaving it vulnerable to digital colonisation. PhotonAI aims to change this by building decentralised, gigawatt AI data centres across all 54 African nations, with the first three set to go live in 2027. By 2031, PhotonAI is projected to: add $3 trillion to Africa's GDP; create millions of jobs; and support 1m developers, 100,000 AI startups and 5m tech jobs. All access to compute, storage and models will be paid in local currencies via BoomPay. A decentralised design ensures resilience, redundancy and sovereignty, giving Africa a voice in the next era of generative AI. According to insiders, Boom is preparing for IPOs in London, New York and Africa. The Boomcoin Treasury Company (BTC) will soon list in New York, providing regulated exposure to BMC. For the first time, a pre-IPO equity round will also be opened to African investors, allowing them to participate directly in what could become the continent's first trillion-dollar tech company. With 10m verified users expected within 12 months and up to 300m by 2030, Boom is building the largest pan-African digital financial ecosystem in history. By connecting £25 trillion in idle cash to the digital economy, Boom has effectively turned Africa into a single borderless market - without a single common currency. For Yao, Monica and millions of others, what once seemed impossible is now a daily reality. Africa's golden age of decentralised finance and AI has begun - led by Boom.",primenewsafrica.com,2025-10-01T08:36:41Z,https://primenewsafrica.com/boom-the-company-leading-africa-into-a-golden-age-of-decentralised-finance-and-sovereign-ai/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.719201,-0.01960784313725494
Clashing Policies: The Impact of Trump's Tariffs and Visa Fees on U.S.-India Trade Relations | Business,"Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff sharply criticized the Trump administration's high tariffs on countries like India and increased H-1B visa fees, underscoring their negative impact on U.S. economic growth. Rogoff emphasized the necessity of liberal visa policies for skilled workers, especially those from India, who significantly contribute to the U.S. tech sector. The increased H-1B visa application fee, implemented amid stalled U.S.-India relations, affects over 70% of Indian nationals granted these visas. Rogoff argued that cutting this talent pool could severely hinder the U.S. economy. He also called the visa fee hike a blunder, urging an expansion in the visa number. Discussing global trade dynamics, Rogoff warned about the long-term consequences of the U.S. tariffs, advocating for a cohesive international response. Despite challenges, he acknowledged India's potential in the global service sector and stressed the need for domestic reforms and reduced tariffs for broader economic integration.",Devdiscourse,2025-10-01T09:10:26Z,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3648490-clashing-policies-the-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-and-visa-fees-on-us-india-trade-relations,2025-10-01 17:26:59.719356,-0.04313725490196074

Is it polite to tip in Morocco? - Curious Expeditions,"FAQ 12: Are there any situations where tipping is not appropriate in Morocco? Yes, tipping in Morocco is considered polite and is generally expected for good service. While not legally mandated, it's deeply ingrained in the culture as a way to supplement income and show appreciation for services rendered. Understanding the nuances of when and how much to tip can significantly enhance your experience and ensure you're interacting respectfully with locals. Tipping, often referred to as ""baksheesh,"" is a common practice that extends beyond the typical restaurant and hotel settings. It reflects a societal understanding that many service workers earn relatively low wages and rely on tips to make a decent living. While it might seem complicated initially, familiarizing yourself with the customary tipping practices will quickly become second nature. Navigating the tipping landscape requires understanding the various service sectors and the corresponding expectations. This section breaks down common tipping scenarios. Tipping in restaurants is commonplace. Generally, a tip of 10-15% of the bill is appropriate if the service was satisfactory. Before leaving a tip, check your bill, as some establishments, particularly in tourist areas, may already include a service charge (""service compris""). If a service charge is included and the service was exceptional, you can still leave an additional small tip. Hotel staff often rely heavily on tips. Consider tipping the following: Tour guides and drivers provide valuable services and should be tipped accordingly. Several other service providers appreciate a tip. Beyond the specific scenarios, there are general etiquette rules to keep in mind. No, tipping is not legally mandatory in Morocco. However, it is deeply ingrained in the culture, and it is generally expected for good service. Think of it less as a requirement and more as a gesture of appreciation that contributes to the livelihood of service workers. ""Baksheesh"" is a term often used in Morocco and other Middle Eastern countries to refer to a tip or a small bribe. While sometimes used interchangeably with ""tip,"" it's crucial to understand the context. While a tip is for service already rendered, baksheesh can also sometimes refer to a small payment to expedite a service or obtain a favor. While not legally required, refusing to tip for satisfactory service can be considered rude, particularly in situations where it is customary, such as in restaurants or with hotel staff. If the service was genuinely poor, you are not obligated to tip, but it's advisable to express your dissatisfaction politely rather than simply withholding a tip. Tipping taxi drivers in Morocco is not always necessary, especially if the fare is metered and reasonable. However, it is customary to round up the fare or add a small tip (5-10 dirhams) if the driver was helpful or provided excellent service, such as assisting with luggage or navigating difficult traffic. If the driver overcharges, tipping is not expected. Always agree on the fare before starting the journey. Tipping is generally not expected at local markets when simply browsing. However, if someone provides assistance with carrying your purchases, a small tip of 5-10 dirhams is appreciated. Bargaining is a common practice in souks, so don't factor tipping into your initial offer. If a ""service compris"" or service charge is already included on your bill, you are not obligated to tip further. However, if the service was exceptional, you can leave an additional small tip as a token of appreciation. While credit cards are becoming more widely accepted in Morocco, it's still not always possible to add a tip to your credit card payment, especially in smaller establishments. It is best to carry cash (Moroccan Dirhams) specifically for tipping. Tipping camel guides in the Sahara Desert is common and appreciated. A tip of 50-100 dirhams per person for a half-day excursion or 100-200 dirhams per person for a full-day or overnight experience is considered appropriate, depending on the length and quality of the experience. While some establishments may accept Euros or US dollars, it is always preferable to tip in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD). It makes it easier for locals to use the money, as they won't have to go to the trouble of exchanging it. Also, they may not get a fair exchange rate. If you are genuinely unhappy with the service, you are not obligated to tip. However, it is generally more polite to express your dissatisfaction directly to the manager or service provider rather than simply withholding the tip. Do so calmly and respectfully, explaining the reason for your dissatisfaction. If someone genuinely helps you find your way and goes out of their way to assist you, a small tip of 5-10 dirhams is a nice gesture of appreciation. However, be wary of individuals who offer unsolicited directions and then demand payment. Tipping is generally not expected in government offices or when dealing with police officers. Attempting to offer a tip in these situations could be misconstrued as bribery. It's also generally not expected when purchasing items directly from street vendors unless they provide an additional service, such as packaging or carrying your purchases. By understanding these cultural nuances and adhering to the guidelines provided, you can navigate the Moroccan tipping culture with confidence and contribute positively to the local economy while demonstrating respect and appreciation for the services you receive.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T09:11:08Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/is-it-polite-to-tip-in-morocco/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.720487,0.1607843137254903

Greece general strike over working hours disrupts travel and services,"Transport and public services in Greece have been disrupted by a 24-hour general strike against government plans to introduce a 13-hour workday. A nationwide general strike in Greece on Wednesday halted trains, ferries and taxis across the capital, as public and private sector workers protest changes to the country's labour laws. No taxis in Athens or trains will run for the duration of the 24-hour strike, while buses and the city's subway, tram and trolley services were operating on a reduced schedule. The strike was disrupting services across Greece, including in schools, courts, public hospitals and municipalities. Two protest marches were planned in central Athens, with demonstrations also set for other cities. Unions representing civil servants and private sector workers called the strike to protest labour law changes that will introduce more flexibility, including allowing overtime that could stretch shifts to 13 hours in a day. Under the new regulations, working hours that include overtime would be capped at 48 hours per week, with a maximum 150 overtime hours allowed per year. Unions argue the new rules leave workers vulnerable to labour abuses by employers. ""We say no to the 13-hour (shift). Exhaustion is not development, human tolerance has limits,"" the private sector umbrella union, the General Confederation of Workers of Greece, said in a statement. The union called for a 37.5-hour working week and the return of collective bargaining agreements.

How strict are Ryanair with luggage? - Curious Expeditions,"How Strict Are Ryanair with Luggage? Understanding Ryanair's Baggage Policy Ryanair is notoriously strict with its luggage policy, making careful adherence to their rules essential to avoid unexpected fees at the airport. While they offer some of the lowest fares, these come with limitations on baggage, and exceeding these limits almost always results in substantial charges. Navigating Ryanair's baggage policy can feel like deciphering a complex code. However, understanding their specific rules and allowances is crucial for a stress-free travel experience. From carry-on sizes to checked baggage options, this guide breaks down everything you need to know. Ryanair operates on a tiered baggage system designed to generate revenue through optional extras. The basic fare only includes a small personal bag that must fit under the seat in front of you. Anything larger requires either purchasing Priority boarding or adding a checked bag to your booking. This is the fundamental concept driving their enforcement. They are strict because baggage fees are a significant revenue stream. The standard free carry-on bag permitted on all Ryanair flights is small, typically around 40x20x25cm. This bag must fit under the seat. Ryanair employs strict size checks at the gate, and passengers whose bags exceed these dimensions will be charged a hefty fee to gate-check the bag. Priority boarding allows passengers to bring a second, larger carry-on bag (typically 55x40x20cm) that can be stored in the overhead bin. Ryanair offers various checked baggage options, ranging in weight from 10kg to 20kg. These bags must be checked in at the baggage drop counter before security. The cost of checked baggage varies depending on the route, travel date, and when you purchase it (online is significantly cheaper than at the airport). It is important to note that exceeding the booked weight allowance for checked baggage will also incur additional charges. One of the biggest takeaways regarding Ryanair's baggage policy is the significant cost difference between booking baggage online and paying for it at the airport. Fees for oversized or overweight bags are substantially higher at the airport, emphasizing the importance of planning ahead and purchasing any necessary baggage allowance during the initial booking process or well in advance of your flight. Ryanair's stringent enforcement of its baggage policy isn't arbitrary; it's a key component of their business model. By offering incredibly low base fares, they attract customers who might not otherwise be able to afford to fly. However, they then rely on ancillary revenue, such as baggage fees, seat selection, and onboard purchases, to maintain profitability. Baggage fees represent a significant portion of Ryanair's overall revenue. By strictly enforcing size and weight limits and charging high fees for violations, they maximize this income stream. This allows them to continue offering competitively low fares while maintaining a healthy profit margin. Beyond revenue generation, strict baggage enforcement also contributes to operational efficiency. By minimizing the number of large carry-on bags onboard, they reduce boarding times and minimize delays caused by passengers struggling to find space for their luggage. This ultimately contributes to their on-time performance, a key metric for budget airlines. Ryanair strives for a consistent and standardized approach to baggage enforcement. This means that regardless of the departure airport or destination, passengers can expect the same strict adherence to the rules. This consistency, while sometimes perceived as rigid, ensures fairness and predictability for all passengers. Avoiding unexpected baggage fees with Ryanair requires careful planning and attention to detail. Here are some practical tips to help you navigate their policy and ensure a smooth travel experience: Here are some frequently asked questions about Ryanair's luggage policy, offering practical answers to common concerns: Ryanair is generally very strict with size limits. Even a slight overshoot could result in a fee. It's best to err on the side of caution and ensure your bag meets the specified dimensions. No, you can only bring one small personal bag (40x20x25cm) that fits under the seat unless you have purchased Priority boarding. The cost varies depending on the route, travel date, and how far in advance you book it. Online purchases are generally cheaper, and prices typically range from €20 to €50 per bag. Yes, you can share a checked bag with a travel companion, but you are responsible for ensuring that the total weight of the bag does not exceed the booked allowance. Ryanair charges per kilogram for exceeding the weight limit of your checked bag. The excess baggage fee is significant, so it's crucial to weigh your bag accurately before arriving at the airport. Yes, Ryanair allows passengers to bring essential medical equipment and medications onboard for free, subject to certain conditions. You may need to provide supporting documentation from your doctor. It's best to contact Ryanair directly to confirm specific requirements. Priority boarding does give you a better chance of securing overhead bin space, but it doesn't guarantee it. Overhead bin space is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Ryanair is liable for lost or damaged checked baggage, subject to the terms and conditions of their carriage. You should report any loss or damage immediately upon arrival at the airport. Yes, passengers travelling with infants are allowed to carry an additional baby bag (up to 5kg) in addition to their own baggage allowance. Yes, you can bring sports equipment, but it will typically be charged as checked baggage and may be subject to additional fees depending on the size and weight. It is essential to check the specific rules and charges for your equipment on Ryanair's website. Liquids in your carry-on bag must comply with standard security regulations, meaning they must be in containers of 100ml or less and placed in a transparent, resealable plastic bag. Small musical instruments, such as violins or guitars, can be carried as carry-on baggage if they fit within the dimensions of a larger cabin bag (55x40x20cm) and you have purchased Priority boarding.

"RBI Holds Rates Steady: Here's What It Means For Homebuyers, Builders And Exporters","New Delhi: With the RBI choosing to keep the repo rate steady at 5.5 percent, there's a mix of relief and realism across industries. For homebuyers, it means no change in EMIs is a kind of welcome sign, especially during the festive season. But real estate experts caution that this alone won't solve deeper affordability issues. On the other hand exporters, particularly small engineering firms are feeling the squeeze from global trade tensions and are calling for more support. From cement GST cuts to calls for cheaper export finance, here's how industry voices are reacting to the RBI's latest move. ANAROCK Group Chairman Anuj Puri, told ETV Bharat that RBI's decision to leave the repo rate at 5.5 percent means that home loan EMIs will not change. This helps overall sentiment, but does nothing for overall housing affordability. According to the most recent data, residential sales in India's top 7 cities fell 9 percent y-o-y to 97,080 units in Q3 2025. However, the total sales value rose 14 percent to Rs 1.52 lakh Cr. This shows that demand has switched even more decisively towards higher-end and mid-range properties. The latest changes to the GST rate are a big help. The GST on cement reduced from 28 percent to 18 percent, which will lower construction costs by 3 to 5 percent and should ideally lead to 1-1.5 percent reduction in housing prices and save homebuyers between INR 1-3 lakh on their purchases, especially in the affordable and mid-range property segments where buyers are quite cost-sensitive. According to data, the share of affordable housing has dropped from 38 percent in 2019 to only 18 in 2024. These GST cuts are critical for changing this trend. Stable borrowing rates and decreased building costs make the housing market more appealing, especially during the holiday season.",ETV Bharat News,2025-10-01T09:12:14Z,https://www.etvbharat.com/en/!bharat/rbi-holds-rates-steady-here-is-what-it-means-for-homebuyers-builders-and-exporters-enn25100102776,2025-10-01 17:26:59.723536,0.1529411764705881
A data efficient framework for analyzing structural transformation in low and middle income economies - Scientific Reports,"Structural transformation, the reallocation of labor and output from agriculture to industry and services, is central to economic development but remains difficult to measure in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to incomplete and inconsistent data. This paper proposes a unified framework that integrates Bayesian hierarchical modeling, machine learning-based imputation, and factor analysis to address this challenge. Using World Bank data (2000-2020) from Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana, we simulate data sparsity and evaluate three imputation techniques. SoftImpute achieves the lowest RMSE for sectoral indicators, while k-Nearest Neighbors excels in reconstructing GDP. Factor analysis distills latent drivers of productivity change, and the Bayesian model incorporates sectoral and temporal heterogeneity under uncertainty. Empirical results reveal distinct national trajectories, service-led growth in Kenya, oil-linked industrial volatility in Nigeria, and balanced expansion in Ghana. Compared to traditional models, the framework offers greater accuracy and interpretability under missingness, providing a scalable tool for structural diagnostics and data-informed policymaking in LMICs. Structural transformation is a central concept in economic development. It refers to the shift from agrarian-based economies to more diversified industrial and service-oriented systems. While this process has been extensively studied in high-income countries, where data is comprehensive and reliable, comparative research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains limited due to data constraints. The scarcity and unreliability of data in these contexts make in-depth analysis difficult. Traditional models and methods often fail to address these limitations effectively, which restricts their ability to capture structural changes accurately. LMICs, and particularly Sub-Saharan African economies, present a critical and under-explored testing ground for structural transformation analysis. These countries face persistent challenges such as high informality, weak statistical capacity, and sectoral volatility, all of which limit the reliability of conventional growth diagnostics. At the same time, policy imperatives in LMICs are closely tied to understanding sectoral transitions, given their implications for employment, industrial policy, and public investment. Yet, most available analytical tools are either ill-suited to sparse datasets or built on assumptions that do not reflect the structural complexity of LMIC economies. Recent efforts, such as those by McMillan et al., have drawn attention to the shortcomings of conventional econometric models when applied to sparse and noisy datasets. While these studies motivated the need for better tools, they stopped short of offering a generalizable methodology capable of integrating imputation, uncertainty modeling, and dimensionality reduction into a single framework. The current paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing and validating an explicitly unified statistical architecture that merges Bayesian hierarchical modeling, machine learning-based imputation, and factor analysis. These components are not treated as interchangeable tools but are operationally interlinked. That is, imputation enhances data quality, factor analysis identifies latent structures that inform priors, and Bayesian modeling produces posterior estimates that reflect both local structure and global uncertainty. This integrated structure represents a departure from earlier sparse-data toolkits, which typically apply individual techniques in isolation or limit their use to sector-specific settings. In contrast, the proposed framework is designed to operate across countries and sectors simultaneously, and it is validated through simulations, error diagnostics, and out-of-sample checks. Furthermore, we benchmark the framework against conventional econometric baselines to demonstrate its empirical and inferential advantages. This study addresses a critical question; How can structural transformation be reliably measured when data is incomplete or unreliable? Our objective is to develop a statistical framework specifically adapted to the realities of LMICs. By combining modern statistical learning and Bayesian methods, the framework responds to the urgent need for tools that remain robust under missing data, noise, and high dimensionality. Many policy decisions in LMICs rely on projections of economic growth, sectoral productivity, and employment shifts. When based on inadequate data, these projections can mislead policymakers. A key contribution of this paper is the demonstration that context-aware imputation, coupled with model-based inference, can significantly improve projection accuracy and reduce uncertainty. To summarize, this paper proposes and empirically validates a coherent, scalable framework that brings together methods often used separately. The novelty lies in the operational interdependence of these components, tested under realistic data conditions, and their application to LMICs where structural transformation analysis is typically weakest. This architecture provides a statistically grounded tool for sectoral forecasting and structural diagnostics in development contexts. Structural transformation in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has attracted growing scholarly attention due to the region's persistent development constraints and shifting growth patterns. Much of the literature aims to understand how economies transition from agriculture toward industry and services, yet these studies have encountered major methodological challenges, chiefly, the pervasive issue of sparse, inconsistent, and unreliable data. Early empirical efforts in this area, such as McMillan et al., demonstrated how sectoral reallocation contributed to productivity growth. However, they also exposed systematic data gaps, especially concerning the informal sector, which often led to overestimation of structural change. Other econometric approaches have relied on national accounts or time-series models to examine sectoral productivity and labor dynamics, but these tools depend heavily on data completeness and linear assumptions, conditions rarely met in SSA. To overcome these constraints, recent studies have explored imputation and machine learning techniques. For instance, researchers have used supervised learning methods to fill in missing data for agriculture and industry, achieving promising results. Nevertheless, these models are frequently narrow in application, designed for single-country or single-sector analysis, and do not generalize well across contexts. Separately, Bayesian hierarchical models have been applied to incorporate uncertainty and regional heterogeneity, particularly in agricultural productivity studies, but have not been systematically combined with other advanced techniques. At the same time, scholars have noted that structural transformation in Africa often departs from classical growth pathways. Rather than following a sequential shift from agriculture to industry and then services, many economies are skipping industrialization altogether and moving directly into services. This non-linear trajectory presents additional modeling difficulties, particularly for traditional econometric models that assume stylized growth patterns. Recent work has called for more comprehensive and adaptive methods. Kweka et al. emphasized the need for better handling of missing data to assess labor reallocation, while others have highlighted the limitations of satellite and survey-based data collection due to cost and accessibility. Factor analysis has begun to be used as a dimensionality reduction technique to uncover latent structures in economic indicators, but this too has largely remained exploratory and context-specific. Despite these advances, no existing study has proposed an integrated framework that combines machine learning-based imputation, Bayesian inference, and latent structure extraction into a coherent, validated approach applicable across countries and sectors. This paper fills that methodological and empirical gap by offering a generalizable framework that not only imputes missing data, but also incorporates hierarchical dependencies and identifies underlying economic forces through factor analysis. The framework is tested under simulated and real data conditions and benchmarked against conventional econometric approaches. Therefore, while the literature has made substantial strides in highlighting the limitations of data-scarce environments and proposing partial remedies, there remains a pressing need for unified, scalable methodologies capable of supporting robust structural transformation analysis in SSA. This study responds directly to that call.",Nature,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-15952-3,2025-10-01 17:26:59.725107,0.05882352941176472
Italy: EIB and Intesa Sanpaolo lend €750 million to support the development of renewable energy and the related supply chain,"The second operation provides for a €250 million counter-guarantee, signed as part of the EIB Wind Package, to stimulate new investments in the European wind industry. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Intesa Sanpaolo, through the IMI Corporate and Investment Banking Division, have signed two financial operations for a total value of €750 million to support the development of renewable energy and the related supply chain. It is estimated that the two agreements announced today will help finance the construction of renewable energy plants for the 2GW Programme and mobilise more than €4.5 billion of investment in the real economy. ""With these agreements we are promoting not only the production of renewable energy but also the growth of a strategic industrial chain to boost the competitiveness of the European Union. Our recent collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo is increasingly focused on promoting decarbonisation of the economy and shows our joint commitment to driving the energy transition and strengthening energy security across the country,"" said EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti. ""The goal of these operations is to facilitate and support long-term investments that can generate value for companies, regions and the entire economy. Our commitment as a group is to support companies on the path to energy transition, bolstering an increasingly key sector for sustainable growth and the competitiveness of Italy's and Europe's economy. In order to achieve these goals, an even closer public-private cooperation that can innovate the industry and stimulate new investments is essential, as shown by this important agreement signed with the EIB,"" said Chief of the IMI Corporate and Investment Banking Division of Intesa Sanpaolo Mauro Micillo. The first agreement consists of a €500 million framework loan, through which the EIB provides Intesa Sanpaolo with a dedicated funding facility to support renewable energy projects, particularly photovoltaic plants, onshore wind and electrical storage systems as well as, to a lesser extent, initiatives in the bioenergy sector. Individual projects will be carried out mainly in Italy (around 80%), but also in other EU countries. As the operation is fully aligned with the REPowerEU objectives, the EIB funds will finance up to 75% of the eligible costs, instead of the standard 50%. It is estimated that this credit line will help unlock €670 million of investment and will enable the generation of about 500 MW of new renewable capacity, with expected annual production of around 1 200 GWh, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of over 400 000 Italian households. The installation and operation of the plants will help generate some 2 300 direct jobs during the construction phase and around 180 permanent jobs during operation. A major share of the investment will take place in cohesion regions of the European Union, thus also supporting the EIB's territorial inclusion agenda. The second agreement provides for a counter-guarantee of €250 million as part of the €6.5 billion Wind Package announced by the EIB at COP28 in Dubai. In this case, the EIB will provide Intesa Sanpaolo with a counter-guarantee, supported by InvestEU, the European Union's investment programme, which will enable it to activate a portfolio of bank guarantees of up to €500 million, designed to back the supply chain and power grid interconnection for new investments in the European wind sector. The high leverage effect of the EIB counter-guarantee will free up additional funding to support increasing production and accelerating wind energy development, helping to stimulate an estimated €4 billion of investment in the real economy and generate around 1.6 GW of new renewable capacity each year. Background information The European Investment Bank (ElB) is the long-term lending institution of the European Union, owned by its Member States. Built around eight key priorities, we finance investments that contribute to EU policy objectives by bolstering climate action and the environment, digitalisation and technological innovation, security and defence, cohesion, agriculture and bioeconomy, social infrastructure, the capital markets union, and a stronger Europe in a more peaceful and prosperous world. The EIB Group, which also includes the European Investment Fund (EIF), signed over 900 projects worth nearly €89 billion in 2024, boosting Europe's competitiveness and security. The EIB Group signed 99 operations totalling €10.98 billion in Italy in 2024, unlocking almost €37 billion of investment in the real economy. All projects financed by the EIB Group are in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, as pledged in our Climate Bank Roadmap. Almost 60% of the EIB Group's annual financing supports projects directly contributing to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and a healthier environment. Fostering market integration and mobilising investment, the funds made available by the Group unlocked over €100 billion in new investment for Europe's energy security in 2024 and mobilised a further €110 billion for startups and scale-ups. Around half of the EIB's financing within the European Union is directed towards cohesion regions, where per capita income is lower than the EU average. The InvestEU programme provides the European Union with long-term funding by leveraging substantial private and public funds in support of a sustainable recovery. It also helps to crowd in private investment for the European Union's strategic priorities such as the European Green Deal and the digital transition. InvestEU brings all EU financial instruments previously available for supporting investments within the European Union together under one roof, making funding for investment projects in Europe simpler, more efficient and more flexible. The programme consists of three components: the InvestEU Fund, the InvestEU Advisory Hub, and the InvestEU Portal. The InvestEU Fund is deployed through implementing partners that will invest in projects using the EU budget guarantee of €26.2 billion. The entire budget guarantee will back the investment projects of the implementing partners, increase their risk-bearing capacity and thus mobilise at least €372 billion in additional investment. Intesa Sanpaolo Intesa Sanpaolo, with €419 billion in loans and €1.4 trillion in customer financial assets at the end of June 2025, is the largest banking group in Italy, with a significant international presence. It is a European leader in wealth management, with a strong focus on digital and fintech. In the environmental, social and governance domain, it plans to make €115 billion in impact contributions to the community and for the green transition by 2025. Its programme to support people in need totals €1.5 billion (2023-2027).

List of Companies Laying Off Employees in October,"Hundreds of employees across the United States are facing layoffs in October, with some big names in American business looking to trim their workforces. Layoffs can occur for many reasons; while they can be viewed as a signal about how companies view economic headwinds, the reasons may also be more localized to individual companies amid restructuring or plans to maximize profits. An August report from outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas found that hundreds of thousands of layoffs have occurred so far in 2025 -- many of which were part of President Donald Trump's changes to the federal workforce. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires employers to give 60 days' notice ahead of mass layoffs. According to the group Legal Aid at Work, a mass layoff occurs under the WARN Act when at least 50 employees are laid off during a 30-day period and affects one-third of the workplace if 500 employees are laid off during a 30-day period regardless of the company's size or an entire work site is closed down and at least 50 employees are laid off during a 30-day period. Among the companies facing layoffs is Microsoft, which is set to lay off 40 workers in Redmond, Washington, and FedEx, which is laying off workers at a Memphis, Tennessee, facility. These are tracked online via WARNTracker.com, which indicates that many businesses across the country have filed WARN notices. The following companies have WARN notices with a layoff date in October, according to the tracker. There are many different economic forces that can lead to layoffs, including a decrease in demand for a product or service, Justin Ren, department chair of operations and technology management at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, told Newsweek. ""But what is less obvious -- and perhaps more relevant today -- is that companies may lay off people while doing well with steady or even increasing demand. This is because companies can become more efficient in their internal operations, either from technology upgrades such as automation and process innovation, or from better organization of their workflows and their supply chains,"" he said. Moving forward, high-tech industries may see more layoffs due to increased productivity, he said. While the redundancies are at times necessary, some businesses may be short-sighted in laying workers off hen facing short-term shocks, he said. When considering layoffs, businesses should consider whether a changing environment is temporary or not, as well as how they can let current employees create more future value rather than dismissing them, according to Ren. Kirabo Jackson, faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, told Newsweek that companies may be laying off workers due to an uncertainty in the markets fueled by Trump's tariffs. ""In a world where there's a general uncertainty, it's not an environment where people want to put down large sums of money and make investments in new people,"" he said. Companies generally do not like to make layoffs, he said. Eventually, many end up hiring new workers to replace those who have been made redundant and will have to train them, so it's generally better for businesses to only downsize when changes are going to last for a long period of time, he said. Companies would typically pass on price changes to consumers and would only lay off employees when they are unable to do so due to weak demand, he said. Justin Ren told Newsweek: ""Employment changes are complex, and are often industry- and geography-specific. There are multiple forces acting and counteracting together."" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president and labor expert at Challenger, Gray & Christmas: ""We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] impact nonprofits and health care in addition to the government. AI was cited for over 10,000 cuts last month, and tariff concerns have impacted nearly 6,000 jobs this year."" The number of Americans filing unemployment claims rose to 196,712 the week of August 30 from 191,208 the week of August 23, according to the Department of Labor. These numbers will continue to be monitored as key metrics of the economy in the coming weeks and months.",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/companies-laying-off-employees-october-10791646,2025-10-01 17:26:59.727049,0.03529411764705892

"Sabah needs a 360° change like Singapore, say observers | Borneo Post Online","KOTA KINABALU (Oct 1): Political observers and local leaders say Sabah urgently needs a 360° transformation in its political administration if it is to rival the economic success of neighbouring Singapore. Despite its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and rich cultural diversity, the state has lagged due to dependence on external political forces and inefficient governance. Observers noted that Singapore rose to become a global economic powerhouse by adhering to five core values since its early independence: maximising its strategic location through modern infrastructure development, adopting an open economy to attract foreign investment, cultivating a highly educated population, maintaining a transparent and contemporary financial system, and building a reputation as a stable nation trusted by investors. They stressed that if these five values were fully applied in Sabah, the state holds vast potential to develop as a regional economic hub. ""If Sabah today mirrored Singapore, it would not be impossible for the state to stand alongside Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China in terms of economic growth,"" one observer said. Pengerusi Penggerak Warisan Keningau (PWK) and former banker, Alphonsus Felix Manjin, underscored the importance of integrity in leadership. ""As long as corruption remains deeply rooted, Sabah's economy will never be able to soar. Total reform must be carried out, and it must begin with political courage,"" he said. Construction industry entrepreneur Kelvin Tham highlighted that Sabah's business climate can only truly thrive if political stability is achieved. ""Investors measure their confidence based on government policies. If Sabah's politics were transparent, clean and stable like Singapore, we would certainly see massive inflows of international investment,"" he stressed. Meanwhile, regional political observer Ir. Joseph Lakai said Sabah cannot continue to rely on the old political model filled with compromises and corrupt practices. ""Sabah needs a 360° political change like Singapore. Only by cleansing corruption in politics can we bring Sabah to its true level of development,"" he said. All three figures agreed that Sabah now stands at a critical crossroads: either remain trapped in the old cycle of weaknesses, or embrace a comprehensive transformation towards clean, modern, and forward-looking politics.",Borneo Post Online,2025-10-01T09:06:51Z,https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/10/01/sabah-needs-a-360-change-like-singapore-say-observers/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.727860,0.3019607843137255
Appeal Could Make It Easier for Companies to Spread Drilling Fluids on Pennsylvania Roadways - Inside Climate News,"In rural Western Pennsylvania, communities routinely spray briny fluids on unpaved backroads to control dust in the warmer months and ice in the winter. Often, those liquids are drilling byproducts from nearby conventional oil and gas wells. That mostly comes courtesy of a loophole in state law that opponents say poses a risk to human and environmental health, and that they fear may soon become larger. A potentially landmark legal case on the practice is currently before the state Environmental Hearing Board, a quasi-judicial body that hears appeals to state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulations. The matter follows a previous case before the board that prompted the DEP in 2018 to impose a moratorium on formal approvals for such ""roadspreading"" using wastes from oil and gas wells. But that left open the door for companies to try a second route, by instead claiming the liquids are a ""coproduct."" Under that process, they test their fluids, which can contain toxic metals and radioactive materials, to ostensibly ensure they are comparable to existing commercial products. When the DEP called the coproduct testing of a northwest Pennsylvania company ""invalid"" this year, the firm appealed to the board. The fight could have sweeping ramifications, said David Hess, a former DEP secretary who authors a newsletter tracking environmental issues in Pennsylvania. ""It has the potential to really open up a whole can of worms,"" Hess said. Siri Lawson, a resident of rural Warren County in northwest Pennsylvania, is also concerned. Lawson has crusaded against roadspreading -- and the gas industry more widely -- for decades, linking industry pollutants to respiratory health problems she suffers. Lawson was at the center of the 2018 case in which the DEP concluded it should use a stricter permitting system and subsequently suspended approvals statewide. For several weeks, Lawson held her breath as DEP engaged in board-mandated settlement talks with appellant BCD Properties, fearing the prospect that state policy could swing back the other direction. ""If DEP meets them in the middle, it'll be more like winner-take-all,"" Lawson said. ""You know, give them an inch and they'll take a mile."" The attorney listed for BCD Properties did not return requests for comment from Inside Climate News. A DEP spokesperson said the agency ""does not comment on active litigation."" But on Thursday, the department filed a motion to dismiss BCD's appeal, potentially signaling that the settlement talks failed. For its part, the Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association (PIOGA), a trade group for conventional well operators, said that ""spreading brine"" on rural roadways has been a practice for decades, not only valued by industry but also communities for which dust from unpaved roads is a primary air pollutant. In an email, the group suggested DEP has long conducted analysis of the practice and found it safe, only to change course in recent years. ""Some individuals seem to make the incorrect assumption that people with the responsibility for spreading brine do so haphazardly and without training, which is not the case,"" Dan Weaver, PIOGA president and executive director, said via email. ""The municipal leaders and employees who do so follow best management practices that have been in place for years in those communities. These individuals live, work and raise their families in those communities and are stewards of the local environment. To claim otherwise is simply untrue."" Most concerns raised about roadspreading are about the content of the wastewater itself. A 2022 Pennsylvania State University study, conducted for the DEP in a laboratory, found that brine produces runoff with problematic levels of chlorides, sodium and cancer-causing radium -- and doesn't control dust any better than rainwater. The sodium could actually damage the roads getting brine treatments, the researchers found, although PIOGA contends the study was ""flawed"" and did not mimic real-world conditions. The BCD appeal is just the latest development in a decades-long effort by the state to regulate the use of drilling wastes for roadspreading, said John Quigley, who served as DEP secretary under Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf from 2015 to 2016. He notes that the agency issued regulations in 2016 banning roadspreading from fracking, also known as unconventional oil and gas. But a simultaneous push to also ban it from conventional operations failed amid political pressure, Quigley said. ""The conventional industry operates on very thin margins, and habitually claims that pretty much any regulation -- like requiring them to properly dispose of their wastewater and not dump it on roads -- will kill the industry,"" Quigley told Inside Climate News in an email. ""Their supporters in the [Pennsylvania state legislature] take that as gospel, and fight tooth and nail against any meaningful regulation of the industry, despite ample evidence of the harms caused to public health and the environment."" DEP has been left in unsettled territory, Quigley said, in which it ""discourages"" roadspreading using fluids from conventional drilling wells, but ""lacks the resources to adequately enforce against the practice."" That's also complicated by the ""coproduct"" loophole, which, critically, leaves it to companies themselves to perform chemical analysis and only requires the results be made available to DEP if the agency requests them. Enter BCD Properties' action against the state. In its legal filings, the company says DEP has failed to establish any legal standard under which a company can obtain a permit to use conventional drilling byproducts for roadspreading, and claims the agency explicitly told BCD it would not receive one. Instead, the company says it went the coproduct route, hiring an environmental consultant in 2019 to compare the fluids from wells it draws from in Erie County to the fluids produced by Seneca Mineral Co., a roadspreading firm whose 2007 permit BCD claims gives its competitor a monopoly. After BCD's analyst determined the products were similar, the company says it continued to sell its roadspreading products. That is, until 2023, when a third party hired by a northwest Pennsylvania township to use BCD's products for roadspreading was threatened with nonpayment by the township over concerns the material was not approved for use, the company said in its legal filings. After that, DEP and a special agent from the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Environmental Crimes Section contacted BCD, the company alleges. It says it then provided the state with a copy of its coproduct analysis, but DEP in April issued an ""invalidation"" letter contending that the study was flawed. BCD filed its appeal with the state Environmental Hearing Board the following month. It said it had to cancel contracts for the summer season. Exactly where things stand now is uncertain: The merits of BCD's case have yet to be adjudicated. DEP's April letter to BCD says the company's analysis was ""insufficient to support a coproduct determination,"" but the agency doesn't explicitly state why. BCD's 2019 analysis appears to have considered just five constituents of its fluids: chloride, calcium, sodium, magnesium and a measurement of total dissolved solids. Not apparent was an analysis of any other potentially concerning constituents, such as radium. But that's also true of 2010 testing results from Seneca's wells, included in BCD's appeal, which include a wider analysis of salts but no tests for metals or other radioactive materials. Hess said his read is that BCD's analysis was judged insufficient because it looked at only five of 39 parameters the state requires in its oil and gas wastewater general permits, and did not evaluate the ""threat of harm to the environment and public health."" ""It's blatantly obvious they did not do what the regulations require at all,"" Hess said. PIOGA said it cannot comment on the merits of BCD's case and noted that the company is not a member. But the trade group disputes the recent research on the safety of roadspreading conducted by the DEP and scientific partners and argues it contradicts prior studies the agency conducted in the field in the 1990s and 2010s. In DEP's latest filing in the case, it argues that its April letter to BCD simply told the company its coproduct testing was ""insufficient"" and was not issuing a final determination, a prerequisite for appeal. DEP also argued that the company's other complaints, including that Seneca Minerals holds a monopoly over competitors, were not germane to the coproduct question. Still, Hess said he's watching the case closely because it has the potential to widen the circumstances in which roadspreading from conventional oil and gas operations can be approved. The case may also have important implications for enforcement. As it stands, Hess said DEP data indicates the agency doesn't know where about 85 percent of wastewater from conventional oil and gas wells produced in Pennsylvania is disposed of. Low staffing levels limit DEP's enforcement ability, and a decision in BCD's favor could further restrict the agency's ability to rein in the practice. There's a lot of waste that DEP doesn't have information about, Hess noted: ""If you do the math, that's about 145 million gallons of wastewater on an annual basis."" Democratic State Rep. Greg Vitali, chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, is now perennially introducing legislation to outright ban roadspreading from conventional wells. That would settle the legal question, Hess and Quigley say, and the legislation has the explicit support of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration. But all observers, including Vitali, say the legislation is highly unlikely to pass through the commonwealth's divided government, or even a razor-thin Democratic majority in the House. ""That fact, that even some of our [Democratic] House members are serving in Republican or very close districts, makes it difficult to even get a floor vote in the House on an issue like this,"" Vitali said. Elsewhere, Hess is tracking the formation of a new ""produced water"" subcommittee consisting of members from several obscure state government entities and an effort by a northwest Pennsylvania company to convince DEP to issue a permit for roadspreading after processing the fluids through treatment technology. To Lawson, the Warren County resident, it's more of the same. ""These guys go from one to the other, to the other, to the other until they find their loophole,"" she said.",InsideClimate News,2025-10-01T08:55:00Z,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/01102025/pennsylvania-roadway-regulations-oil-gas-brines/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.729489,0.02745098039215677
"Credit card fraud rising in Canada, application fraud falling: Equifax Canada report","TORONTO -- A new report says the second quarter of the year brought a sharp rise in credit card fraud. Equifax Canada says the rate of credit card fraud jumped to 0.75 per cent in Q2 compared with 0.44 per cent a year earlier. That means out of every 10,000 credit cards, about 75 are fraudulent compared with 44 last year. The consumer credit reporting agency says the spike came despite application fraud rates across Canada falling to their lowest point since the third quarter of 2022. Application fraud is when someone lies or uses stolen information on an application for credit, a loan or another financial service. Application fraud rates dropped to 0.56 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, down from 0.70 per cent in the previous quarter and 0.57 per cent a year ago.

"UK banks borrow £5.1bn from BoE repo, highest since March 2020","Banks borrowed 5.085 billion pounds ($6.84 billion) from the Bank of England at its weekly indexed long-term repo for six-month funds on Tuesday, the greatest amount since March 2020 when there was a surge of demand at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BoE has been seeking to increase usage of the facility as it shifts away from a system of excess reserves in Britain's banking system and unwinds much of the 875 billion pounds of quantitative easing gilt purchases it bought from 2009 to 2021. Almost all the funds were secured with the highest grade of collateral, which allows banks to borrow with no surcharge on top of the BoE's main interest rate.

The House of Dior Beverly Hills opens on Rodeo Drive,"In 1990, Dior opened its first store on Rodeo Drive, the first Dior location in North America. Thirty-five years later, the luxury brand owned by the LVMH group has just opened a 60-foot-tall building. Open to the public since Saturday, the store located at 323 North Rodeo Drive called upon its star architect, Peter Marino, chief designer of Dior boutiques, including most recently, 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris and the new flagship store House of Dior New York, which opened in August. The magnificent, undulating stucco façade now revealed its window displays featuring miniature scenes of Paris, including an ultra-detailed model of La Galerie Dior at 30 Avenue Montaigne, complete with characters, realistic settings, and nods to Los Angeles with the ""HollywoodDior"" sign and the Bel-Air hotel. ""A cinematic journey, a luminous dialogue between Paris and Los Angeles that pays tribute to the house's timeless couture heritage,"" explains Dior's team, ""each offering a living tableau of small scenes from Dior's odyssey in the United States."" These animations can also be found on the second floor of the store, in the jewelry section, where a window display pays tribute to designer Christian Dior, accompanied by his faithful dog Bobby. Surrounded by a garden featuring a dancing sculpture by artist Niki de Saint-Phalle, the boutique reveals an interior with light-colored parquet flooring strewn with antique rugs and a palette of natural, earthy colors. In the center stands the sculptural ""Ginkgo"" bench designed by sculptor and artist Claude Lalanne in the late 1990s, from which several bouquets of flowers spring forth. On the ground floor, visitors first discover the space reserved for leather goods and handbags, furnished with seating areas and counters. This is followed by an area dedicated to women's shoes, decorated with sculptural tables and large speckled benches, and another dedicated to perfumes. A corner showcases the house's scarves, presented on wall displays and in a large trunk. In each space, Dior silhouettes blend into the decor. In contrast, the men's section plays on other motifs and a color palette combining brown, camel, and gray tones. The sunglasses collections, all the leather goods for men, and ready-to-wear are presented here. The store's centerpiece, the majestic staircase, a nod to the Barneys New York store in Los Angeles designed by Peter Marino 38 years ago, surrounds a small garden designed by Marino in collaboration with landscape architect Peter Wirtz, offering a panoramic view of the spaces. There are a number of small lounges dedicated to women's ready-to-wear in a Parisian apartment-style setting with Dior gray walls, large mirrors, and angel tapestries. Divided by large gold and silver stone walls, the jewelry and fine jewelry area showcases the house's latest collections in circular metal display cases. There is also an area dedicated to men, with large fitting rooms and two VIP rooms. Dotted with numerous art pieces by Frederic Heurlier-Cimolai, Adam Fuss, and Horst P. Horst, the boutique also unveils many pieces of furniture in bronze, brass, metal, and aluminum by the Voukenas Petrides studio, artist Audiane Delos, and Maison Leleu. One floor up, the house opens its VIP area around a huge terrace overlooking the Hollywood sign and its restaurant, Monsieur Dior. The space, whose menu has been designed by San Francisco's three-star chef Dominique Crenn, is set to open to the public in the last week of October. It features a lounge with a bar and an indoor-outdoor dining room that can accommodate up to 105 guests.

High-speed thrills await as Indian Racing Festival roars into Kari Motor Speedway for Round 3,"The Round 3 of Indian Racing Festival 2025 will take place at Kari Motor Speedway, Coimbatore, this weekend (October 4-5). The Indian Racing Festival is set for Round 3 this weekend (October 4-5) at the iconic Kari Motor Speedway in Coimbatore. After a mid-season break, the championship returns for Round 3, following action-packed opening rounds at the Kari Motor Speedway and the Madras International Circuit in Chennai. With rivalries intensifying and the title battle heating up, fans can expect an unforgettable weekend of Speed, drama and fierce competition. The spotlight will be on the Indian Racing League (IRL), a franchise-based series, along with the Formula 4 Indian Championship and JK Tyre National Racing Championship LGB F4. The JK Tyre National Racing Championship which is in its 28th consecutive year is the longest running racing championship by a single promoter in the country. The India-make Formula LGB4, has been part of the championship ever since its inception and has gone through many technological advancements over the years. With IRL drivers battling for every crucial point, the fight at the top of the standings promises to be nothing short of electrifying. Hyderabad Blackbirds, led by Jon Lancaster (Britain), Akshay Bohra, Gabriela Jilkova (Czechia), and Mohamed Ryan, hold the slimmest of advantages on 51 points. Breathing down their necks is the relentless Speed Demons Delhi, just a single point behind on 50, ready to seize the lead at the slightest opening. Hot on their heels, the Kolkata Royal Tigers roar in with 49 points, turning the championship fight into a three-way encounter where every lap matters. With margins razor-thin and pressure at boiling point, Coimbatore sets the stage for a high-octane showdown that could redefine the title race. Motorsport fans have already seen how Coimbatore and Chennai presented contrasting challenges. Coimbatore, saw Raoul Hyman quickly adapt to the layout on Day 1 of the season opener, before Sai Sanjay of Speed Demons Delhi stole the show on Day 2 with his raw speed. With two rounds completed, teams are now better prepared to tackle the circuit. The cars remain reliable and capable of producing high speeds down the flat straight. In Chennai, rain had made qualifying extremely tricky. The Kari Motor Speedway, known for its tight layout and unpredictable weather, leaves no margin for error. A sudden drizzle or shifting track temperature could turn the leader board upside down in seconds, demanding both right strategy and raw skill - and with Hyderabad Blackbirds and Speed Demons Delhi locked in a one-point fight at the top, the slightest slip could be the spark that ignites this season's fiercest rivalry. Reflecting on the season so far, Akhilesh Reddy, Chairman & Managing Director, RPPL, said: ""With two rounds completed, we've seen encouraging growth in competitiveness and fan engagement this season. Returning to the Kari Motor Speedway is always special.""

World's first museum dedicated to MF Husain to open in Qatar,"Doha: ""Seeroo fi al ardh"", a unique installation and the final masterpiece by MF Husain in the format of a 20-minute show, will be among the highlights of the world's first museum dedicated to the life, works, and philosophy of the modernist master. Qatar Foundation on Wednesday announced that the museum, ""Lawh Wa Qalam: M F Husain Museum"", will open in the nation's capital city, Doha, on November 28. The museum will be dedicated to tracing Husain's artistic journey, from the 1950s until his death in 2011. ""Maqbool Fida Husain was one of the world's most legendary modernists, an artist whose vision emerged from and resonated across different cultures, including here in Qatar, where he lived and practiced during his life,"" Kholoud M Al-Ali, executive director of Community Engagement and Programming, Qatar Foundation, said in a statement. With a permanent collection on display spanning paintings, films, tapestry, photography, poetry and installations -- all presented through multimedia storytelling -- the museum will invite visitors to step inside the world of Husain and explore the influences, philosophies, and memories that shaped his practice. Among the works on view will be a series of paintings commissioned by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairperson of Qatar Foundation, and inspired by Arab civilisation. Husain completed over 35 of these paintings before his death in 2011, and they will feature in the galleries of the museum. Covering over 3,000 square meters, the design of the museum mirrors a sketch by Husain depicting the architectural concept he envisioned for the building, which he saw as being an artwork in itself, reflecting his lifelong pursuit of experimentation and his artistic work across multiple disciplines. ""It is an honor to present his work within a dedicated museum of this scale -- a space where audiences can engage deeply with his life, his art, and his enduring global legacy. Conceived as a space for inspiration and creativity. Lawh Wa Qalam: M F Husain Museum reflects Qatar Foundation's dedication to providing spaces for everyone to explore, enjoy, learn from, and be inspired by art and culture,"" Al-ali said.

Zimbabwean Companies Eye Growth Opportunities Ahead of Mine Entra 2025 - herald,"As Zimbabwe prepares to host the annual Mine Entra 2025 which will be held the ZITF Grounds in Bulawayo starting on October 8, local firms are using the event to position themselves at the center of a country-wide push for industrial and economic growth. For many, the exhibition represents not just a showcase of products and services, but an opportunity to navigate the challenges and opportunities of a shifting business landscape. For Ground Up Civils, a firm led by Mr Admire Musingarabwi, Mine Entra offers a platform to highlight how multidisciplinary engineering expertise can meet the country's growing infrastructure needs. ""Our work spans project management, construction, and engineering services for industrial and commercial projects,"" Mr Musingarabwi says. ""Events like this allow us to connect with potential partners and understand where our skills can have the greatest economic impact."" Logistics and distribution are also central to Zimbabwe's industrial ambitions. Foust Corporation's Chief Executive Ms Gwendolene Mnangagwa believes managed warehousing and distribution for all sectors are critical roles in supply chains that impact mining and manufacturing concerns. Ms Mnangagwa noted the critical role supply chains play in economic performance. ""Industries and mines can only grow if goods move reliably and efficiently. Our role is to reduce friction in distribution so businesses can focus on production and growth."" Meanwhile, Digitalpaper Consolidated General Manager, Mr Tenny Sibanda, brings a consulting perspective focused on organisational performance. ""Companies often have the expertise to solve problems internally, but translating ideas into long-term change is difficult. Our work helps leaders and teams design solutions that stick. Mine Entra is a space where these practical insights meet real business challenges,"" said Mr Sibanda. Economists see Mine Entra as more than an exhibition; it is a microcosm of Zimbabwe's industrial ambitions. Observers expect the event to foster collaborations, facilitate investment deals, and provide insight into how private sector innovation can support national development targets, including infrastructure expansion and economic diversification. For companies attending, the stakes are high. While the exhibition offers visibility, the real opportunity lies in forging partnerships that translate into tangible projects. By combining engineering, logistics, and business expertise, Zimbabwean firms hope to not only secure contracts, but also influence how industries adapt and grow in a fast-changing economic environment. As Zimbabwe charts its industrial future, Mine Entra 2025 may serve as a key indicator of the private sector's ability to respond to economic demands and shape the trajectory of the country's business landscape over the coming decade.",herald,2025-10-01T09:09:38Z,https://www.heraldonline.co.zw/?p=4911774,2025-10-01 17:26:59.733029,0.2862745098039217
2 Dividend Stocks to Buy for Decades of Passive Income,"Both stocks could have positive tailwinds over the next few years. The stock market as a whole is starting to look expensive. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and many other key benchmark indices are within a few percentage points of all-time highs, and all look historically expensive by several valuation metrics, including average P/E ratios, price-to-book multiples, and more. However, there are still some excellent long-term opportunities to be found, and that's especially true when it comes to high-yield stocks. With interest rates still at a historically high level, dividend stocks can be a bright spot in the market where it's still possible to find reasonable valuations for investments to buy and hold for the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More "" With that in mind, here are two high-paying dividend stocks in particular that could be excellent investments right now if you're a patient investor looking for great income and total returns. Image source: Getty Images. I've called Realty Income (NYSE: O) my favorite overall dividend stock in the market, and as one of the largest positions in my own portfolio, I've put my money where my mouth (or keyboard) is. If you aren't familiar with it, Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT (pronounced 'reet'), and it invests in single-tenant properties. About three-fourths of its tenants are retail in nature, and it also has industrial, agricultural, and gaming properties. Its retail tenants are hand-picked for their recession resistance and/or their lack of vulnerability to e-commerce. Plus, tenants sign long-term leases with gradual rent increases built in, and agree to pay insurance, taxes, and most maintenance costs. This model allows Realty Income to generate excellent total returns over the long run, and with less overall volatility than the S&P 500. And the proof is in the performance. Although Realty Income has underperformed (as would be expected) during rising-rate environments, since its 1994 IPO it has produced 13.5% annualized total returns for investors, well ahead of the S&P 500, and it has raised its dividend for the past 112 consecutive quarters. Realty Income has rebounded nicely from its recent lows but still trades for about 25% below its all-time high. It has a 5.4% dividend yield and pays in monthly installments (Fun fact: Realty Income has a trademark on the phrase 'The Monthly Dividend Company.'). In a nutshell, Realty Income offers a rare combination of a high yield, market-beating total return potential, and safety. Another REIT, Prologis (NYSE: PLD) is another high-dividend stock to put on your radar. One of the largest REITs in the world, Prologis is the leading logistics real estate company, owning warehouses, distribution centers, and other properties all around the world. For example, if you've ever seen one of those massive Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) distribution centers, that's an example of the type of property Prologis owns. The company owns a staggering 1.3 billion square feet of leasable space, and nearly 3% of the world's entire GDP flows through Prologis' properties each year. Recent results have been strong, after a period of weakening demand resulting from overbuilding during the pandemic years. In the most recent quarter, Prologis reported core funds from operations (Core FFO-the real estate equivalent of 'earnings') growth of 9% year-over-year, and management reported a strong pipeline of leasing activity and plenty of customers ready to grow. The long-term tailwinds should be more than enough to give Prologis plenty of opportunities to grow. The global e-commerce market (which fuels much of the demand for logistics properties) is expected to more than double in size by 2030, according to Grand View Research. And the data center industry, which Prologis recently entered, is expected to grow just as fast. Both of these stocks are real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and these are an especially rate-sensitive group. As a result, if the Federal Reserve ends up pumping the brakes on further rate cuts, or if inflation unexpectedly picks up, it's possible for these two stocks to be rather volatile in the short term. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,068%* -- a market-crushing outperformance compared to 190% for the S&P 500. Matt Frankel has positions in Amazon, Prologis, and Realty Income. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon, Prologis, and Realty Income. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $90 calls on Prologis.

"Mahesh Kudav, Managing Director of Venus Safety & Health, appointed Chairman of the Indian Technical Textile Association (ITTA)","VMPL Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], October 1: Industry veteran and entrepreneur Mahesh Kudav, Managing Director of Venus Safety & Health Pvt. Ltd., has been appointed as the new Chairman of the Indian Technical Textile Association (ITTA) at the association's Annual General Meeting held on September 19, 2025. His appointment marks a significant milestone in a distinguished career dedicated to strengthening India's safety and technical textiles ecosystem and advancing the country's self-reliance in critical manufacturing sectors. A pioneer in the field of personal protective equipment and technical textiles, Mahesh Kudav has built Venus Safety & Health Pvt. Ltd. into one of India's foremost PPE manufacturers with exports to over 32 countries. From starting a small proprietary concern in 1985 with limited capital, Kudav's journey reflects entrepreneurial resilience and innovation-led growth. Under his leadership, Venus has established world-class R&D capabilities, introduced multiple patented safety technologies such as the Butterfly Exhalation Valve and Twist & Click Gas Filter, and emerged as a trusted supplier of advanced respiratory protection solutions for defence, firefighting, healthcare, and hazardous industries. Speaking on his new role, Mahesh Kudav said, ""It is an honour to be elected Chairman of ITTA and to have the opportunity to lead the technical textiles industry at a transformative time. Over the next two years, I aim to strengthen member services, deepen engagement with policymakers, and equip our industry with the governance frameworks, skills, knowledge and digital capabilities needed to compete globally. Our collective focus will be on building a strong domestic ecosystem while preparing Indian manufacturers to become significant players in global markets."" Kudav's role in building national capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic further underscored his leadership. He spearheaded a massive production ramp-up, enabling Venus to deliver over 20 lakh NIOSH N95/FFP2 masks per day, while mentoring more than 180 domestic manufacturers to meet stringent PPE standards -- a crucial contribution to India's self-reliance at a critical time. Beyond his entrepreneurial achievements, he has been an active contributor to national and international standardisation efforts, serving on BIS committees, representing India in ISO respiratory standards, and partnering with IITs and DRDO on cutting-edge safety technologies. Kudav outlined a strategic roadmap that includes strengthening ITTA's engagement with government on industry challenges, improving access to materials and machinery, building a skilled workforce through training and internships, and expanding domestic demand through inter-ministry initiatives supported by the Ministry of Textiles. He also emphasised closer collaboration with research institutions and Centres of Excellence to accelerate the adoption of new technologies and innovations, preparing the industry for exports and global competitiveness. Expressing his appreciation for the foundation laid by his predecessors Mr. Avinash Misar and Dr. Anoop Rakshit, Kudav highlighted his commitment to building on their work and taking ITTA's mission to the next level. He will be supported in this journey by Dr. Nandan Kumar and newly appointed Executive Director Mr. Anil Vasupillai. With this appointment, Mahesh Kudav brings his decades-long experience, deep technical expertise, and innovation-driven mindset to the leadership of ITTA. His vision is to create a stronger, more competitive technical textiles industry that not only meets India's domestic needs but also establishes the country as a global hub for advanced textile solutions -- a mission that aligns closely with the national vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.

The Best Growth Stocks to Buy With $100 Right Now,"Nu has many growth drivers, including adding new customers and entering new markets, and the opportunity is wide open. The market is back to strong growth this year as tariffs, inflation, and increasing unemployment don't seem to be derailing it. The S&P 500 is up 13% year to date, and it's a great time for growth investors to buy great stocks that are moving up. SoFi likes to call itself the only one-stop shop for digital money management. It sees itself as differentiated from the large pack of neo-banks because it offers a broad array of services, and that model resonates with an upwardly mobile class of younger consumers who want to engage with financial management from their smartphones. Growth has been impressive. Adjusted net revenue increased 44% year over year in the second quarter, an acceleration. Management attributes the faster increase to an upward spiral that starts with an easy-to-use platform that attracts new clients; a complete assortment of services that generates higher engagement; and more money plowed back into the business to upgrade, add new tools, and become even more attractive. It's also a low-cost model that breeds loyalty. There are no physical branches, and customers typically start out with one product, which means a relatively low acquisition cost. But as each customer signs up for more products, they come with a high lifetime value. SoFi's target market is customers who are just getting started in managing their money, and this cohort has a long financial road ahead of it. It's no wonder the market sees tremendous opportunities here and is rewarding SoFi stock accordingly: It's up more than 225% during the past year. Image source: Getty Images. Lemonade is another disruptor in its industry. It offers most types of insurance, but it's all built with artificial intelligence (AI), and customers are flocking to its online platform. Its top line has grown rapidly for years, but it's taken some time for it to gather enough data to price policies competitively and drive profitability. That's finally happening, and Lemonade stock is finally taking off; it's up more than 200% during the past year. For insurance companies, the first step toward profit is reducing the loss ratio, or the average amount of policy premiums paid out as claims. That requires some serious underwriting skills, and it naturally takes time to collect enough customers, assess patterns, and create algorithms to make the business work. Lemonade's goal is to keep its loss ratio under 75%, and it was 70% for the trailing 12 months in the second quarter, or nine percentage points lower than the year before. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and net income are following. Management said it expects adjusted EBITDA to become positive next year, with positive net income in 2027. Lemonade has been able to keep its operating expenditures steady despite the business growing at a fast pace, leading to increasing cash flow. This is just the beginning. Lemonade has an edge over legacy insurance companies, and look for it to take a big leap forward in the coming years. Nu is taking banking to a new level in its home country of Brazil, as well as its newer markets of Mexico and Colombia. Its founders were frustrated by the barriers to banking services for the mass market, and Nu's all-digital platform provides access to the financial system for every type of customer. Its low-fee, user-friendly model appeals to these customers, who were previously locked out of the system, but it's also catching on with affluent consumers who are dissatisfied with the stodgy incumbent banks. That's leading to consistently outstanding results. Revenue increased 40% year over year in the second quarter (on a currency neutral basis), and it added 4.1 million customers in the quarter and 18 million in the trailing 12 months, a 17% increase. As an all-digital player, it has low costs, and profitability has been soaring; second-quarter net income increased 42% to $637 million. Even in Brazil, where it already has 60% of the adult population as customers, it's adding new members at a rapid pace. It's also finding new ways to monetize them, cross-selling and upselling new products and services to users who are still getting started in engaging with the financial system. It has many growth drivers, from adding new customers to monetizing existing ones, as well as entering new markets and adding new features and tools to the app. Nu has an incredible future, and now is a great time to buy.

2 High-Yield ETFs to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,"10 stocks we like better than Tidal Trust II - YieldMaxDA Option Income Strategy ETF "" Income-focused investors have plenty of options at their disposal when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). One type of ETF that is gaining a lot of traction today is option income ETFs. The big draw is large yields, but there are material risks to consider before you buy one of these funds. In the end, most investors will be better off with fairly simple options like Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEMKT: DIVO) and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEMKT: IDVO). The ultra-high yields on offer from ETFs like YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT: NVDY) could be a siren's song that hurts you more than helps you. Options are created when a person sells another person the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a future date. The person buying the right pays a fee to the person selling the right. The most common type of option is a covered call, in which a person who owns a stock sells someone the right to buy that stock at a future date. If the option is used (exercised), the stock must be sold. If the option is not exercised, nothing happens. Either way, the fee that is paid is kept by the stockholder. Selling covered calls is a fair amount of work and only more active, and probably aggressive, investors should use this income-generating approach. However, it is a way to create an additional income stream from your stock portfolio that could be valuable. This is where option income exchange-traded funds come in. Simply put, you don't have to do the work because someone else is doing it for you. Tread carefully with option income ETFs. There are some that offer dividend yields that just can't be sustained over the long term. And often, those same ETFs are so highly concentrated that there is material asset-specific risk (also called idiosyncratic risk) to consider. If you were going to sell covered calls to generate additional income from your dividend portfolio, you would likely start by building a portfolio of stocks you like. And then you would start looking at selling covered calls on those stocks. You would probably find that selling covered calls worked better at different times for different stocks, which would leave you strategically selling covered calls across the portfolio. This is what Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF both do. The difference between these two covered call ETFs is in the name. One is focused on international stocks and the other is U.S.-focused. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 30 stocks that are fairly well diversified by sector. And it sells covered calls on just a portion of the portfolio at any given time. That allows the owners of the ETF to generate extra income and benefit from capital appreciation, too. (Covered calls can limit the upside of a stock if the call is exercised.) Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 60 or so stocks, applying the same basic approach to foreign stocks. In both cases, the outcome has been a fairly reliable dividend over time, accompanied by a rising share price. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a yield of around 4.6%. Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a trailing 12-month yield of around 5.5%. Both are actively managed ETFs and have fairly high expense ratios of 0.56% and 0.66%, respectively. But if you are looking for consistent income from a covered-call strategy, these ETFs basically do what you would do if you chose to sell covered calls yourself. At the other extreme is YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF. It is actually just one of an entire family of option income ETFs offered by YieldMax. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's trailing 12-month yield is 81%. If that sounds too good to be true, it likely is. For starters, many of the YieldMax ETFs are focused on just one stock, and they use a complex options approach to generate income instead of buying the stock and then selling covered calls. That's a lot more aggressive than what either of the Amplify ETFs does. On top of that, option income can be highly variable from month to month for any given stock. Amplify addresses that issue by having a diversified portfolio and selling covered calls strategically. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy can't do that. The income it generates is entirely reliant on just one stock. As the chart below highlights, the income you actually collect can change dramatically each month. Then there's the risk posed by return of capital. Notice in the chart above how YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's price has declined over time. That's because it is paying so much out in dividends that it is depleting its capital. There are some fairly complex tax issues involved here, but from a practical point of view, you are getting some of your original investment back with each dividend you collect. The only way to avoid that is if the underlying stock goes up dramatically. That can happen for a period of time, but Wall Street has a habit of pushing up stocks and then eventually pushing them down again. There are no free lunches, as the saying goes. Meanwhile, the expense ratio for YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF is a lofty 1.27%. You are paying more for a less reliable income stream and the risk of your capital declining over time. To be fair, the huge yield numbers from YieldMax Option Income ETFs are very alluring. And perhaps for some investors, they will be a good fit. But if you are looking for a long-term investment, you should probably keep it simple and focus on option income ETFs that do what you would do. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF don't have the highest yields, but they do have much more sustainable investment approaches.

UK manufacturing activity shrinks at fastest pace in five months in September,"Activity in the UK manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace in five months September, according to a survey released on Wednesday. The S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index dropped to 46.2 from 47.0 in August, remaining below the 50.0 mark that separates contraction from expansion for the twelfth month in a row. S&P noted that four of the five PMI components - output, new orders, employment and stocks of purchases - were consistent with a deterioration in operating conditions. Manufacturing production declined for the eleventh month in a row, at the fastest pace since March, with the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors all seeing output fall at solid rates. Manufacturers said production had been scaled back due to weaker intakes of new business, with demand from both domestic and export markets weak. The survey also found that new order intakes subsequently fell for the twelfth month in a row, and to one of the greatest extents in the past two years. This was put down to subdued client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and the consequences of a high cost backdrop, in particular for energy and staff. There were also reports that automotive supply chains were disrupted due to production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The final manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. Manufacturers are facing an increasingly challenging environment, with intakes of new business and levels of production hit by weak market sentiment, a dearth of new export work and a high-cost environment exacerbated by tax and labour cost rises. Companies entwined into the autos supply chain are also facing a temporary hit to activity following the cyber-attack on JLR. ""The current tough operating environment is also seeping through to business confidence and leading to an increased focus on cost cutting. Confidence about the next 12 months remains at a relatively subdued level, job losses have been recorded in each of the past 11 months, and a further cut in purchasing activity is symptomatic of a focus on trimming non-essential spending.""",BOLSAMANIA,2025-10-01T09:11:14Z,https://www.sharecast.com/news/news-and-announcements--/uk-manufacturing-activity-shrinks-at-fastest-pace-in-five-months--20977432.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.737659,0.01960784313725483
"Don't overlook White Horse Village, a retirement gem","When visitors tour White Horse Village in Edgmont Township, Delaware County, they're often surprised by the spaciousness, natural beauty and exceptional amenities. These aren't units stacked together in a high-rise. The homes and apartments feature outdoor areas with space for a garden or patio chair, fitting in with the peaceful appeal of its tree-lined sidewalks and more than 100 acres of meadow adjoining the serenity of Ridley Creek State Park. As a nonprofit continuing care retirement community (CCRC), White Horse Village offers a range of lifetime care options that provide peace of mind for both residents and their families. Residents enjoy independence today, with the reassurance that care and support are available if needs change tomorrow. ""It's the best gift you can give your children, and you may have heard that before, but it just takes the burden off their shoulders to know every night that we're being well taken care of,"" said resident Dianne Hirt. The community's extensive amenities mean residents can embrace a lifestyle full of activity and connection. The Wellness Center features modern exercise equipment, an indoor pool and a jacuzzi. The Clubhouse serves as a social hub for gatherings and events, while the outdoor recreation spaces provide opportunities to enjoy nature year-round. With so many options, many residents discover they need less square footage than they once thought, because their living space extends throughout the campus. Resident Dale Steffens realized that a smaller space better matched her needs, and she found it in a one-bedroom home. Now that she's made the move, Dale is happy she did. ""Honestly, I am surprised how great it is,"" she said. ""It's just perfect."" Perhaps most importantly, White Horse Village offers more than just a place to live -- it is an active and welcoming community. There is a warm and inclusive culture, with a small-town feel where neighbors wave hello and stop for conversations in the Clubhouse or along the sidewalks. ""We really have a community here, and that's a big deal with us,"" said resident John Hirt. ""We like to be friendly and outgoing and work with people. This place does it all."" From gardening and woodworking to fitness classes and social gatherings, White Horse Village provides the perfect blend of private living and community connection. The combination of thoughtfully designed residences, a beautiful natural setting, and a culture of caring creates an ideal environment for active retirement living.

Better Crypto Buy: Chainlink vs. BNB,"The question for investors here is, between these two coins, where can value compound more broadly over time? Chainlink's core job is to bring real-world data onto blockchains and move messages and tokens across them. That makes it an indispensable piece of infrastructure for the entire crypto sector, as many different applications require a structured data import functionality for the backend. Its data catalog covers price feeds, proof-of-reserves, and macroeconomic stats. Plus, it also offers CCIP, a cross-chain interoperability protocol that lets applications ship tokens and messages from one chain to another. The investment thesis for buying begins and ends with its impressive fee flywheel. Decentralized applications (dApps) pay user fees for Chainlink data oracle services. Those fees support its node operators and, via staking, the network's security. As more apps integrate data feeds, more fees show up to fund the development of more data services, which attracts more apps, and also a wider variety of them. Importantly, CCIP's billing model lets developers pay a single fee denominated in LINK on the chain where the data gets used, thereby significantly simplifying cost predictability and making the service easier to adopt at scale, as well as across blockchains. This scheme also ensures that projects operating on multiple chains can keep the portion of their working capital that's used to pay data fees distributed based on data usage. App deployments on smaller or less-used networks are less economically burdensome as a result, lowering the barrier for cross-chain expansion. There is evidence the core value generation loop is working. Chainlink is the category leader by revenue in the crypto interoperability segment, generating $9.6 million in revenue over the last three years. Furthermore, large financial institutions have tested or used Chainlink to move and verify fund data across chains, and the U.S. government is even using it to publish economic data to the blockchain now. Chainlink's neutral, multi-chain posture positions it to earn fees wherever activity shows up, rather than betting on one chain's success. That makes it resilient, and it will be exposed to a lot of growth over the coming years as well. BNB is the utility token for the Binance exchange's ecosystem. Holders use it for trading fee discounts on Binance, and as the gas fee asset on the BNB Smart Chain, and also for its layer-2 (L2) chains. So right off the bat, this coin's chosen field of competition is fairly constrained, as the Binance ecosystem is almost entirely dedicated to providing crypto exchange services. BNB's tokenomics include ways to burn tokens and thus increase the value of it for holders. There's an auto-burn mechanism, which aims to reduce supply over time toward a 100 million BNB target, and a real-time fee burning mechanism that's based on activity on the network. As of today, the circulating supply is near 139 million, implying there is still a meaningful path to the stated supply target, so new buyers would benefit from this process playing out over time, assuming it continues. The strategic challenge here, as stated before, is that most of BNB's utility is bounded by Binance's footprint. While it's true that Binance is a systemically important crypto exchange platform, and a titan within the space, the coin's growth fully depends on continued adoption of BNB Chain and its L2s, plus the durability of trader-targeted benefits like trading fee discounts on Binance itself. And the BNB Chain, while effective at being a platform for the needs of Binance's exchange, is not itself a network with any notable competitive advantages, despite its decently fast settlement times and relatively low usage fees. Plus, its inseparable relation with Binance itself carries plenty of idiosyncratic risk. In late 2023, Binance entered a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, agreeing to extensive compliance reforms, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (more famously known as CZ) later received and served a short prison sentence in 2024. The exchange is still on questionable legal footing in the U.S., and suspended its operations there in late 2024. Could BNB still surprise to the upside if you buy it now? It's possible, if the growth of the crypto exchange leads to more on-chain activity, which then accelerates fee-based burns. But in comparison to Chainlink's chain-agnostic fee capture across many ecosystems, BNB's upside is structurally tied to a single brand and stack. Chainlink's business model lets it monetize wherever crypto grows, and its fee flywheel is already spinning. BNB remains compelling for believers in Binance's platform, but its opportunity set is far narrower and carries more single-ecosystem risk, as well as legal risks. Therefore, Chainlink is the better long-term buy for investors seeking exposure to crypto's broadening utility rather than a single venue's expansion.

Topps Tiles delivers another record year as momentum builds in second half,"Tile retailer Topps Tiles said its strong trading performance continued throughout the second half, with revenues reaching a record high in four out of the past five years. The company, which appointed a new chief executive (Alex Jensen) just last month, said in a pre-close trading update on Wednesday that revenues over the 52 weeks to 27 September were up 6.8% at £265m. Including the CTD brand, which was acquired earlier this year, group sales were 17.7% higher at £296m. Each division (Topps Tiles, Parkside, Online Pure Play and CTD) reported sequential growth in the second half, with like-for-like sales growth at Topps in particular rising from 3.0% to 7.7%. Margins have also improved in the second half, though additional costs related to increases in the National Living Wage and National Insurance Contributions - which took effect in April - along with increases in performance-related pay, mean adjusted profits should be in line with the consensus forecast range of £8.3m-9.2m.

Where Renting on the SouthCoast Costs the Most,"As anyone looking for a new place to live can tell you, the cost of renting an apartment is still painfully expensive. Experts say you shouldn't take on a monthly rent that is more than 30% of your income for the month, yet in some of the more pricey corners of the country rents can be 42% or even 66% of one's monthly take-home pay. But how bad are things here on the SouthCoast? New national rankings from LawnLove.com show that New York City is still the most expensive place for renters in the country. It's not too surprising: residents here often spend over 40% of their monthly income for housing. Flagstaff, Arizona finds itself at #8, but a list of Florida and California cities fill in the rest of the Top 10. Overall Boston ranked #19 on LawnLove's list with Providence close behind at #21. But exactly how expensive are things for local renters? Using LawnLove's study as motivation, we dug into the current rental numbers for cities and towns across the SouthCoast to find out where one can find the best rates for rent.

"India eyes MoUs worth Rs 25,000 crores MoUs at world's largest rice conference, BIRC 2025: Prem Garg, IREF","New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): The upcoming Bharat International Rice Conference, scheduled to be held on October 30-31 at Bharat Mandapam in Delhi, is expected to give a significant push to India's rice exports and benefit thousands of farmers across the country. The conference is being organized for the first time in India and will bring together a large number of global stakeholders from the rice industry. Highlighting the importance of the event, Prem Garg, National President of the Indian Rice Exporters Federation (IREF) and Chairman of Shri Lal Mahal Group, said that the conference will be attended by more than 1,000 guests from 80 countries, along with the participation of 4,000-5,000 farmers from India. ""Bharat International Rice Conference is the largest global conference which is going to happen in India for the first time. It will be held on 30-31 October in Bharat Mandapam, Delhi. PM Narendra Modi has been invited, and all ministries are involved in the preparations. Approximately 4,000-5,000 farmers will also attend this conference and will directly or indirectly benefit from its outcome,"" he said. Garg added that the interaction of farmers with international stakeholders and buyers will help strengthen India's position in the global rice market. ""The conference is being organised keeping in mind our vision for 2047, and it will prove to be a milestone for India,"" he said. The event is already seeing positive outcomes even before it begins. According to Garg, three countries have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth Rs 2,200 crore for the import of 6 lakh metric tonnes of rice from India. ""We are expecting basmati and non-basmati rice contracts worth Rs 25,000 crore to be signed during the conference,"" he said. With India being one of the largest rice exporters in the world, the conference is expected to play a pivotal role in expanding trade opportunities and boosting farmers' incomes. The participation of farmers in such large numbers is also being seen as a step toward connecting them directly with the export ecosystem, which can provide long-term benefits for their livelihood. Industry experts believe that the Bharat International Rice Conference will not only showcase India's rice sector globally but also open up new avenues for future trade partnerships, strengthening India's agricultural exports in the years ahead.

3 Reasons the Crypto Sector Tumbled Last Week,"The week appeared to be profit taking, combined with policy jitters, rather than a thesis changer for either bulls or bears. The crypto sector took a collective tumble last week. It wasn't a completely harmonious drop, as stablecoins held firm (as intended) and outliers such as Zcash (CRYPTO: ZEC) posted big gains. But the overarching crypto trend was unmistakably bearish: Let's take a look at the factors that inspired these crypto price swings last week. Image source: Getty Images. Last week's crypto action needs a bit of additional context. The two weeks before this period were pretty bullish thanks to signs of stabilization in the American economy. Encouraged by helpful trends in recent inflation reports and other macroeconomic data points, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time since December 2024. As a result, risk-averse investors such as large financial institutions poured fresh cash into cryptocurrencies and crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Mature cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, for example) posted roughly 5% gains and moved close to their all-time highs; Dogecoin and Solana enjoyed double-digit percentage gains. That crypto-friendly period led up to a wave of profit taking last week. Some of the sales were also forced, as leveraged crypto investors had to settle margin calls on trades financed by borrowed funds. That's a risky business, folks. Investors who prefer spot-priced cryptocurrency ETFs over holding the cryptos directly are usually not big fans of high-risk, high-reward strategies. This on-ramp to the crypto world is available to many accounts that simply can't touch Bitcoin or Ethereum directly -- large-scale institutional investors, personal retirement plans, and risk-dodging people who prefer an extra layer of regulatory protection. It's not surprising to see these groups take profits too, especially when the price peak was largely motivated by political and regulatory moves. ETF owners can't make trades over the weekend, though. Therefore, the direct cryptocurrency drawdown on Sunday, Sept. 21, translated into a modest outflow of ETF funds on Monday, Sept. 22. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) saw a $38 million outflow that day, while the iShares Ethereum Trust (NASDAQ: ETHA) lost $15 million of customer funds. These figures aren't huge, but that's still a sharp trend reversal from steady inflows in recent weeks. And then there's the wonkish elephant in the room. On Thursday, Sept. 25, more political pressure was piled on cryptocurrencies (and other investment markets). Congress threatened to close down government operations on Oct. 1, the Trump administration pledged to take military action in Gaza, and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issued a stern warning that ""there is no risk-free path"" to a healthy economy. That's the big dip you saw in the chart earlier. Crypto investors took Powell's warning seriously, and a $200 million outflow from the iShares Ethereum Trust made the earlier retreat look forgettable. That's a bitter brew of profit taking and politics. I should point out that all five cryptocurrencies in the chart are up by at least 34% over the last year, more than doubling the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index's 15.5% gain over the same period. Hence, crypto bears can still argue that the market remains overheated, while the bulls can treat this price dip as a buying opportunity. Either way, the events of last week probably didn't move many investors from one side to the other in that eternal clash.

"Oil pauses as markets assess OPEC+ plans, demand concerns","LONDON :Oil prices steadied on Wednesday after falling for two days as investors weighed OPEC+ plans for a larger output hike next month while data from the U.S. and Asia showed signs of demand waning. Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 6 cents to $66.09 a barrel by 0835 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 4 cents to $62.41 a barrel. On Monday, Brent and WTI both settled more than 3 per cent lower, their sharpest daily declines since August 1. On Tuesday, they each fell 1.5 per cent further. ""After two days of sell-off, triggered by reports of OPEC+ hike and the resumption of Kurdish oil export, focus is shifting back to the supply and export disruption in Russia due to continuous and successful Ukrainian assaults,"" said PVM Oil Associates' analyst Tamas Varga. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, could agree to raise oil production by up to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, triple the increase made for October, as Saudi Arabia seeks to reclaim market share, three sources familiar with the talks said. However, OPEC wrote in a post on X that media reports of plans to raise output by 500,000 bpd were misleading. In the latest update on attacks on Russian energy infrastructure from Ukraine, Russia has imposed a partial ban on diesel exports and extended an existing gasoline export ban until the end of the year, the government said on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the U.S., an industry report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell while gasoline and distillate inventories rose in the week ended September 26, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute estimates on Tuesday. ""While U.S. crude inventories have been on a declining trend, the pace of drawdowns has slowed, tempering bullish sentiment,"" Sugandha Sachdeva, founder of SS WealthStreet, a New Delhi-based research firm, said. The U.S. government shut down much of its operations on Wednesday as deep partisan divisions prevented Congress and the White House from reaching a funding deal - which government agencies have warned would halt the release of a closely watched September employment report, amongst other things. Data on factory activity in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region, also added to concerns about fuel demand, as manufacturing activity contracted across most major economies in September.",CNA,2025-10-01T00:52:44Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/oil-pauses-markets-assess-opec-plans-demand-concerns-5378856,2025-10-01 17:26:59.740956,-0.1607843137254902
Judge suspends Trump administration's plan to eliminate hundreds of Voice of America jobs | Jefferson City News-Tribune,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge agreed Monday to temporarily suspend the Trump administration's plan to eliminate hundreds of jobs at the agency that oversees Voice of America, the government-funded broadcaster founded to counter Nazi propaganda during World War II. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff. Kari Lake, the agency's acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force. Lamberth previously ruled that President Donald Trump's Republican administration must restore VOA programming to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to ""serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news."" He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA's director. Judge cites ""concerning disrespect"" toward court from administration Lamberth accused the administration of showing ""concerning disrespect"" toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America. He noted that the agency initiated the job cuts only hours after a hearing last month in which government lawyers said a reduction in force, or RIF, was merely a possibility. ""The defendants' obfuscation of this Court's request for information regarding whether their RIF plans comported with the preliminary injunction has wasted precious judicial time and resources and readily support contempt proceedings,"" Lamberth wrote. But he said he wouldn't initiate contempt proceedings on his own because the plaintiffs haven't sought it yet. ""However, (the court's) deference to the plaintiffs with respect to further proceedings should not be mistaken for lenience toward the defendants' egregious erstwhile conduct,"" he added. Employees who sued to block the dismantling of Voice of America claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge's ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. ""This Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance,"" their attorneys wrote. Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency's operations. ""Enjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy,"" they wrote. Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Can media agency continue to fulfill its ""statutory mission""? The U.S. Agency for Global Media also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an estimated 427 million people, date to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism. Congress appropriated $875 million to the agency for fiscal year 2025 and required that $260 million of the funds must be spent by VOA. In March, Trump signed an executive order called for the agency to reduce its ""statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law."" A day later, VOA stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The agency placed almost all of its full-time employees on administrative leave. In announcing the job cuts on social media last month, Lake said the agency ""will continue to fulfill its statutory mission ... and will likely improve its ability to function."" ""I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most,"" she wrote. Plaintiffs' attorney Georgina Yeomans argued Monday that the cuts would cement the agency's programming at deficient levels that don't comply with the judge's orders. Yeomans said it's unclear who at the agency is making key decisions, such as which jobs to eliminate. ""We simply do not know,"" she said.",Jefferson City News Tribune,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newstribune.com/news/2025/oct/01/judge-suspends-trump-administrations-plan-to/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.741503,-0.2784313725490196
Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: BigBear.ai vs. SoundHound AI,"However, their fortunes on the stock market have been quite contrasting in 2025. While BigBear.ai's stock price has jumped an impressive 47% as of this writing, SoundHound has lost more than 21% of its value. Let's look at the reasons why one of these AI stocks has made investors richer this year and the other one has struggled. BigBear.ai provides AI software solutions to help improve the decision-making processes of both commercial and government customers. It applies AI and machine learning (ML) tools to clients' data for applications such as predictive analytics, threat detection, facial recognition, and biometrics, among others. Though the company points out that it is present in multiple areas such as defense, intelligence, border security, travel, hospitality, manufacturing, and supply chain, the bulk of its revenue comes from government contracts. The similarity that BigBear.ai's business has to that of Palantir's explains why investors have been buying this stock hand over fist. But then, a closer look will tell us that BigBear.ai's stock price surge isn't justified by its poor financial performance. The company reported an 18% year-over-year decline in its revenue in Q2 to just under $40 million. Management attributed this sharp drop to ""lower volume on certain Army programs,"" which tells us that its reliance on federal contracts for a big chunk of its revenue isn't paying off. Moreover, BigBear.ai's margins shrank, and its losses increased on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, Palantir is enjoying outstanding growth in its business by attracting both commercial and government customers. This clearly suggests that BigBear.ai isn't finding much traction in the fast-growing AI software market. Additionally, the company's revenue backlog indicates that it doesn't have much visibility going forward as well. That's because only a small portion of its backlog is funded. Almost 95% of the $380 million backlog it reported at the end of Q2 is either unfunded or unexercised, which means it will only be recognized as actual revenue if its customers decide to buy its solutions. We have already seen that BigBear.ai struggled last quarter thanks to lower demand from a key government customer, which also forced it to lower its 2025 guidance. In fact, BigBear.ai's top line is set to drop by double-digit percentages this year, suggesting that it may find it difficult to deliver more upside to investors, especially considering that its price-to-sales ratio of 12 is on the expensive side. While Bigbear.ai is finding it difficult to grow its business despite operating in a lucrative market, SoundHound AI isn't facing any such problem. The company's revenue in the second quarter was up by a whopping 217% from the year-ago period to $43 million. The good part is that SoundHound AI's growth trajectory has been picking up in recent quarters. The pick-up in the company's growth isn't surprising, considering that it has been quick to build a solid customer base through its product development moves and acquisitions. SoundHound AI's voice AI solutions are used by customers in the automotive, hospitality, restaurant, financial services, retail, and healthcare industries. What's more, it was sitting on a much bigger potential revenue backlog of $1.2 billion at the end of 2024. The fact that it has been growing at an outstanding pace clearly tells us that it has been successfully converting that massive backlog into revenue. That's also the reason why the company has raised its revenue guidance for 2025. Its top line is on track to double this year to $169 million, which is the midpoint of its guidance range. Another thing worth noting is that SoundHound is growing at a faster pace than the 23% annual growth rate of the conversational AI market, which means it's winning a bigger share of this lucrative space that's expected to generate over $79 billion in annual revenue by 2033. As a result, there is a good chance that SoundHound will be able to sustain its remarkable growth rate in the long run and eventually become a much bigger company. That's why investors would do well to buy it following its slide this year. Of course, the stock is expensive right now at 47 times sales, but that seems justified, considering how fast it is growing and its solid prospects. As such, buying SoundHound AI over BigBear.ai seems like the smart thing to do for anyone looking to choose from one of these two AI stocks right now.

Liverpool legend John Barnes declared bankrupt after company racks up £1.5m debt,"John Barnes has been declared bankrupt after running up debts of more than £1.5m through his media firm. A bankruptcy order was issued in the High Court of Justice last week before being published in the London Gazette on Tuesday. The issue stems from his now-liquidated company John Barnes Media Limited, of which the Liverpool legend had been banned from being a director for three and a half years due to the debts. Liquidators' reports show he owed HMRC £776,878 in unpaid VAT, National Insurance, and PAYE, alongside £461,849 to unsecured creditors and a £226,000 directors loan. Barnes has so far paid back £60,000 after agreeing to return the directors loan in instalments. The former winger, who was the first player to earn £10,000-a-week, has faced multiple bankruptcy petitions since 2010, including one in 2023 which related to a £238,000 personal tax bill that was settled at the final hour. Barnes previously revealed how he has been poorly guided financially over the years and spoke on the All Things Business podcast about the eye-watering amount he has had to give to the taxman. ""Like a lot of elite sportspeople, I got burned because I trusted people, I got caught out a couple of times and ended up losing between £1m and £1.5m over four years,"" he said in August. ""In 2017, I began talking to HMRC about what I could do to repay what I owed."" The 61-year-old said that he has repaid £2.2m since 2017 and continues to pay £10,000 each month. Barnes also addressed what he claims are misleading reports about his financial affairs, reaffirming his commitment to repaying what he owes. He added: ""I know how hard it is for people out there. I don't want to say there are loopholes, or that I can get away with this or that, or have people think I can be made bankrupt and keep my assets, because I've already sold everything. I don't have any assets. ""But every time something new comes up, stories appear in the press saying negative things about how I am not paying my taxes, even though I'm going to court, not to be made bankrupt, but to ask for permission to keep paying. ""Football is a working-class sport, and I don't want hard working people thinking I've got all this money and I won't pay tax. It would be easy to be made bankrupt because they can't take anything else from me."" Barnes earned 79 England caps during a playing career spanning almost two decades, in which he won two league titles with Liverpool.",Yahoo Sports Canada,2025-10-01T09:06:34Z,https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/liverpool-legend-john-barnes-declared-090634959.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.742666,-0.03529411764705881

"DoorDash expanding into restaurant reservations, robot deliveries | Jefferson City News-Tribune","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- DoorDash is expanding its offerings, adding restaurant reservations and robot deliveries in some U.S. markets. The San Francisco-based company, already the largest U.S. delivery provider, announced its expansion plans Tuesday, saying it wants to bring even more business to the merchants it works with and stay ahead of ever-increasing customer demand. DoorDash's total orders jumped 20 percent to 761 million in the second quarter of this year. DoorDash's robots will bring new challenges to the company as it takes on the responsibility for storing and maintaining the devices. But DoorDash Co-Founder Stanley Tang said the company needs more delivery options to help fuel its future growth. ""The shift to autonomy is happening right now, and DoorDash is uniquely positioned to do something like this,"" Tang said Monday during an interview at the company's San Francisco headquarters. ""We need to find ways to keep up with the demand. The complexity of the deliveries being made on our platform is increasing too."" Still, investors appeared lukewarm about the company's plans. DoorDash shares fell 1 percent Tuesday. DoorDash's plans also threaten other delivery and reservation platforms like OpenTable and Instacart. On Monday, after DoorDash said it would expand its partnership with Kroger to offer delivery from the grocer's 2,700 U.S. stores, Instacart's shares fell 10 percent. DoorDash said Tuesday that its new ""Going Out"" tab will let users book tables at restaurants. Reservations will be offered first in New York and Miami, with other cities to be added later this year. In cities without restaurant reservation capabilities, the ""Going Out"" tab will let DoorDash customers earn rewards and in-store offers. DoorDash said its DashPass members -- who pay $9.99 for free deliveries on most orders -- will also get extra perks, like the ability to reserve exclusive tables. DoorDash signaled its interest in adding reservations with its recent purchase of SevenRooms, a New York company that makes reservation and hospitality management software. DoorDash announced the $1.2 billion purchase in March. DoorDash said adding reservations and deals helps it deepen its relationship with restaurants and bring them new patrons. During testing in San Francisco, the company found that 80 percent of customers using ""Going Out"" visited a restaurant they had never ordered food from before. DoorDash also said Tuesday it will soon begin providing some deliveries in the greater Phoenix area with an autonomous robot. The robot, which was designed by DoorDash and is dubbed Dot, can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour and travel on streets, sidewalks and driveways. DoorDash has spent the last seven years developing the robot. The company decided to develop its own after finding that other delivery robots on the market, which are mostly designed for short runs on college campuses or urban sidewalks, weren't capable of operating in the suburban neighborhoods where DoorDash makes many of its deliveries. The company said it could also use its own data to optimize the robot. ""After 10 billion deliveries, we have data on what works, what breaks and what scales,"" said Tang, who leads DoorDash's autonomy and robotics division. Dot is bright red and resembles a big baby stroller. It's 3 feet wide, 4.5-feet tall and large enough to handle up to six large pizza boxes or 30 pounds of cargo. Tang said DoorDash has already made hundreds of successful deliveries with Dot during the past few months in Tempe and Mesa, Arizona. If things continue to progress smoothly, DoorDash plans to bring Dot to more markets across the U.S. as quickly as possible, Tang said. DoorDash executives view Dot's development as the next major step in an evolution that has already seen the company expand from a shoestring operation that was making a few restaurant deliveries in Palo Alto, California, 13 years ago. DoorDash has become a ubiquitous service that now operates in more than 30 countries. DoorDash has also been testing drone delivery for several years in Australia, Texas and North Carolina. Tang said the company is developing a system that will automatically determine the best mode of delivery depending on the order and where it's going. ""Our vision is hybrid, human delivery and autonomy working together to expand access to more people,"" Tang said.",Jefferson City News Tribune,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newstribune.com/news/2025/oct/01/doordash-expanding-into-restaurant-reservations/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.744041,0.1137254901960785
"Royal Orchid Hotels and Mumbai's Newest Lifestyle Hotel, ICONIQA, Partners with Paisa4Plates to Launch Innovative Charitable Initiative","NewsVoir Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], October 1: Royal Orchid is proud to announce a groundbreaking partnership with Paisa4Plates, a charity movement spearheaded by Aryaveer Baljee, Youth MP for Hampshire. Starting with ICONIQA Mumbai, the groups game-changing upscale lifestyle hotel, this initiative introduces an innovative, voluntary giving model to ROHL's hotels across India, empowering guests to contribute to feeding the homeless, providing mid-day meals to children, and donating food to those in need. Inspired by the remarkable success of the Pounds4Plates movement in London, where participating restaurants added an optional 0.25% service charge to bills to support food charities, Aryaveer Baljee has brought this model to India under the banner of Paisa4Plates. The program, rooted in Aryaveer's Indian heritage and his commitment to social good, aims to foster empathy and consciousness among hotel guests while addressing critical issues of hunger and homelessness in India. Under this branded movement, guests staying at Royal Orchid's portfolio of over 120 hotels in India, spanning brands such as Regenta, Regenta Place, Royal Orchid, and the recently introduced ICONIQA, will have the option to contribute 0.5% of their bill to a cause that each individual hotel chooses. This small, voluntary contribution will directly support local charities focused on providing meals to the homeless, mid-day meals for schoolchildren, and food donations to combat hunger. Guests will be informed of the initiative through table tents and other communication channels, ensuring transparency and choice. ""We are thrilled to partner with Paisa4Plates to bring this meaningful initiative to our guests in India,"" said Shibani Malhotra, General Manager, ICONIQA Mumbai. ""This aligns with our core mission to make travel impactful for all. By offering our guests the opportunity to contribute to such a worthy cause, we hope to create a ripple effect of positive change in communities across India."" Aryaveer Baljee, the visionary behind Paisa4Plates, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, ""Hospitality is about more than just service--it's about building bridges and uplifting communities. After the success of Pounds4Plates in the UK, I felt compelled to bring this model to India, where the need is immense. Partnering with ICONIQA and Royal Orchid Hotels, brands with a strong and growing presence in India, allows us to scale this initiative and make a tangible difference in the lives of the hungry and homeless."" The Paisa4Plates movement is designed to be sustainable and low-barrier, allowing hotels to act as facilitators while gaining goodwill and positive engagement from guests. The program will launch across Royal Orchid's Indian properties in late 2025, covering with plans to expand its reach in collaboration with local NGOs and food banks. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts remains committed to its corporate responsibility efforts, including community support and sustainability, as evidenced by its ongoing initiatives to combat human trafficking and reduce environmental impact.

Amsterdam's FORWARD.one launches €200M Fund III to fuel Europe's industrial tech startups - Silicon Canals,"Amsterdam-based FORWARD.one, a venture capital firm specialising in industrial technology, has announced the launch of its third fund, Fund III. The fund is targeting commitments of €200M, with a hard cap of €250M. The majority of the fund's target has already been secured from a strong base of returning and new investors. Fund III will invest in early-stage technology companies driving breakthroughs in semiconductors, climate tech, robotics, hardware, and other key areas of industrial innovation. The fund will provide initial tickets of €1-3M, with substantial reserves for follow-on investments. Its portfolio is expected to include 25-30 companies across the Benelux, DACH region, Nordics, and other leading European hubs. Riemer Smink, Managing Partner at FORWARD.one, says, ""Fund III gives us more clout to support Europe's most technological pioneers. The fact that we have already secured most of our target amount demonstrates the strong belief in our strategy and in the opportunities offered by industrial technology."" Fund III is launching amid challenging fundraising conditions, including high interest rates and stricter investor requirements. However, there is a growing need for advancements in technological independence, climate-friendly innovation, and industrial capabilities, making this a crucial time for investors. Since its founding, FORWARD.one has established itself as one of Europe's top-performing venture capital firms. Its first fund, launched in 2018, delivered a net IRR of 41 per cent and a DPI of 2x, placing it among Europe's leading VC funds according to PitchBook. With successful exits including Sensorfact (acquired by ABB) and Mayht (acquired by Sonos), Fund I set a strong foundation for the firm's results-oriented profile. According to the VC, Fund II, a €145M vehicle launched in 2021, is on track for similar performance, backing a growing portfolio in semiconductors, robotics, climate innovation, and industrial technology. Beau-Anne Chilla, Partner at FORWARD.one, adds, ""Our strategy has been proven: invest early, scale up quickly, and achieve exits through our network and hands-on support."" ""With Fund III, we want to support entrepreneurs in commercialising their technological innovations into applications that change society, while continuing to achieve top results for our investors."" Founded in 2018, FORWARD.one is a venture capital firm designed to address the 'unique' needs of high-tech companies. It was founded by a team of experienced investors and entrepreneurs who support the growth of the tech ecosystem in Europe. Since its foundation, the firm has reviewed more than a thousand companies, and its team claims to have learned about the opportunities offered by high tech in the Netherlands. Arjan Göbel, Partner at FORWARD.one, says: ""Europe has a unique lead in tangible, complex technologies such as chips, robotics and sensors, with a rich history of successful industrial leaders such as ABB (Switzerland/Sweden), ASML (Netherlands), Infineon Technologies (Germany), STMicroelectronics (France/Italy), and many others. These companies have built ecosystems that are virtually impossible to replicate globally and that provide fertile ground for a new generation of industrial tech startups.""",Silicon Canals,2025-10-01T09:03:45Z,https://siliconcanals.com/forward-one-launches-200m/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.745067,0.3647058823529412
Etsy and Shopify Cozy Up With OpenAI's ChatGPT: What You Need to Know,"Investors should watch adoption, fees, and conversion -- not headlines -- to gauge whether this actually moves the needle. E-commerce just took a step further into artificial intelligence (AI). On Monday, OpenAI announced that U.S. users can now buy from U.S. Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) sellers directly inside ChatGPT, with support for more than one million Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) merchants ""coming soon."" The experience -- called Instant Checkout -- keeps shoppers in the conversation from discovery to payment and was co-developed with Stripe. For investors, any AI headline these days is flashy -- and likely to cause moves in share prices. Indeed, Etsy stock soared almost 16% on Monday in the wake of this news. And Shopify shares jumped more than 6%. The real question, however, is whether this changes traffic patterns and conversion enough to matter for Etsy and Shopify over the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More "" Etsy operates a two-sided marketplace known for handmade, vintage, and unique goods. Shopify provides commerce infrastructure for businesses of all sizes across online and offline channels. Both already benefit when product discovery happens off their platforms (social, search, influencers). Generative AI chats becoming a transactional channel is the next logical extension. Image source: Getty Images. OpenAI says product search results with Instant Checkout in ChatGPT are organic, ranked purely on relevance (not any sort of sponsored placement), and can now be purchased simply by users tapping ""Buy"" within their chat threads. Orders are still fulfilled by the merchant; ChatGPT simply passes information securely via the new Agentic Commerce Protocol. That matters because it keeps merchant branding and relationships intact while potentially capturing impulse purchases that start as conversations about gift ideas or prompts like, ""Show me ideas under $100."" Importantly, ChatGPT is no small partner. OpenAI says it has over 700 million people who already ""turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love."" Instant Checkout is live first for U.S. Etsy sellers. This builds on the company's recent efforts to integrate ""emergent AI technologies,"" as CEO Josh Silverman said in the company's second-quarter update. This, combined with efforts to make its shopping experience more browsable and personalized, is ""creating a significant runway for growth, as well as an opportunity to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders by capitalizing on what makes Etsy special,"" he added. The catalyst comes at a good time for Etsy, because it has been struggling. Etsy's gross merchandise sales (GMS) in Q2 fell 4.8% year over year to $2.8 billion. Notably, however, revenue for the quarter did grow 3.8% to $672.7 million as the company leaned on ads and payments, lifting its take rate to 24%. If ChatGPT-driven discovery can reactivate lapsed buyers or lift conversion on gift-centric searches, investors should see it first in GMS stabilization and active-buyer trends. While Etsy goes first, Shopify's upcoming inclusion may be an even bigger unlock. Shopify's merchant scale (its second-quarter GMS was $87.8 billion, dwarfing Etsy's) gives this feature real distribution. But investors will have to watch to see whether Instant Checkout is incremental to existing channels and doesn't simply shift orders from merchants' own sites. Odds are, however, that a meaningful portion of these orders will be incremental. Shopify's VP of Product Vanessa Lee said in a press release about the upcoming integration that it will let merchants ""show up naturally"" inside AI conversations with no links or redirects, giving shoppers ""a way to buy without breaking their flow."" Unlike Etsy, the integration comes at a time of strength for Shopify. Its second-quarter revenue rose 31% year over year to $2.68 billion, and GMV rose by the same amount. Management framed results as the payoff from ""bold bets we made years ago."" As exciting as the announcement is for Etsy and Shopify, investors should keep their expectations in check. First, Instant Checkout only supports single-item purchases today, with multi-item carts to follow. Second, OpenAI says rankings are unsponsored; that's good for trust and the user experience but means sales volumes will depend on user behavior, not paid placement. Finally, remember that OpenAI states merchants will pay a ""small fee"" on completed transactions, so it will be interesting to see how the economics unfold over time. After a sharp pop on the news for both stocks, investors shouldn't be treating this as an automatic buy signal. But if evidence builds over time that chat-commerce funnels new, incremental demand at healthy conversions, and that merchant adoption stays high despite fees, then this could be a big deal. Investors should keep an eye on the integration over time to see how it impacts both e-commerce businesses.

The Crypto Perp DEX Mania May Quickly Fizzle Out: BitMEX CEO,"SINGAPORE -- By the time Token2049 reconvenes next year, today's headline‑grabbing decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid and Aster may no longer dominate, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz told CoinDesk in an interview, warning that their incentive‑heavy business models are too fragile to endure. Recently, a competitive battle has erupted in the perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) sector, with emerging platforms like Aster and Lighter significantly challenging Hyperliquid's former dominance. Last week, Aster surpassed Hyperliquid in terms of 24-hour trading volume. This has sparked a race among competitors to launch new DEXs, aiming to capture market share in this expanding field. In this context, Justin Sun announced the launch of a new DEX at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, signaling further intensification in this rapidly evolving landscape. The excitement, however, is likely to be short-lived, according to Lutz, who called DEXs as inherent pump-and-dump schemes. ""DEXs are about giving access to markets without intermediaries, and they build momentum by relying heavily on incentives, it's basically an inherent pump‑and‑dump scheme,"" Lutz said. ""I don't mean that in a bad way or as a scam. It's all public, you know what you're getting into."" He likened the incentive programs to an advertising blitz that pays for attention, explaining that these platforms hook users with token rewards and fee rebates and then depend on that feedback loop to keep people trading. This boom‑and‑bust cadence not only makes it hard for DEXs to retain liquidity over the long term, he added, it also means retail traders chasing outsized yields are exposing themselves to considerable volatility and risk. In contrast to the churn he sees in DeFi, Lutz said the largest centralized exchanges, led by Coinbase and its peers, are well-positioned to ride out these cycles and remain dominant long after the latest DEX incentives subside. He added that BitMEX's goal is to straddle both worlds, noting that while he sees DeFi enduring and embraces it personally as a crypto native, institutions can't interact with it like they can with a centralized exchange. The Japanese capital, not Hong Kong or Singapore, is where the trading volume is, according to Lutz. In August, the exchange officially moved its data infrastructure to AWS Tokyo from AWS Dublin in a move aimed at boosting liquidity. The switch has delivered the desired results, underscoring Japan's attractiveness. ""We were in Ireland before ... but it became more and more difficult because basically everyone except the U.S. players are in the Tokyo data centers,"" he said. He said the switch boosted liquidity by roughly 80% in BitMEX's main contracts and up to 400% in some altcoin markets, gains he attributed not to market-maker intervention but to reducing latency by being in Tokyo. Lutz predicts the next crypto cycle will look markedly different from prior booms and busts. With greater institutional participation, he said, BTC could behave more like a ""real asset,"" smoothing out the dramatic peaks and troughs that have defined past runs. ""I expect that with greater adoption we'll see longer plateau phases than in previous cycles; the market will still follow the same rules and characteristics, but with lower volatility as it becomes a real asset embraced by the world's wealthy,"" he said. The bitcoin market volatility has declined markedly since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. last year. Moreover, BTC's implied volatility indices have steadily evolved into VIX-like structures, moving in the opposite direction of spot prices. All this means that even though some of these new DEXs, offering eye-watering leverage - which Lutz believes won't last until next year - there aren't fireworks in store for BTC. Instead, it'll look like any other sophisticated asset class with gradual ups and downs as the market cycle continues.",CoinDesk,2025-10-01T09:04:44Z,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/the-crypto-perp-dex-mania-may-quickly-fizzle-out-bitmex-ceo,2025-10-01 17:26:59.746438,0.1294117647058823
BYD Denza B5 and Denza B8 SUVs confirmed for Australia,"BYD Australia has announced the Denza B5 and Denza B8 plug-in hybrid (PHEV) large SUVs will be the first two models to be released by its Denza sister brand here, confirming a November 2025 local launch for the new Chinese luxury brand. The five-seat Denza B5 is similar in size to the Toyota Prado and GWM Tank 300, while the seven-seat B8 is a larger three-row SUV designed to take on the likes of the Toyota LandCruiser 300 Series and Nissan Patrol. Pricing and equipment levels for the two new models are yet to be announced, as are any official details of Denza's Australian dealer network. The Denza B5, essentially an SUV version of the BYD Shark 6 PHEV dual-cab ute already in local showrooms, is priced between ¥239,800 and ¥302,800 in China, which equates to approximately A$50,950-$64,340. CarExpert can save you thousands on a new car. to get a great deal. The Denza B8 is priced between ¥379,800 and ¥407,800 in China, or approximately $A80,700-$A86,650. A right-hand drive B8 was previously spotted undergoing testing on Australian roads, and CarExpert tested both the B8 and the B5 earlier this year in China. Denza is a sister brand of Chinese auto giant BYD, offering premium rather than mainstream models and echoing the relationship between Lexus and Toyota. In a statement, BYD said it will offer ""a curated range of premium vehicles from BYD's three acclaimed sub-brands - reimagined under the Denza name"". That means models sold overseas under the Fangchengbao, YangWang and Denza brands will sold under the Denza name here. The two new models are sold in China as the Fangchengbao Bao 5 and Fangchengbao Bao 8, which translates to 'Formula Leopard', but they will ditch the Fangchengbao branding in favour of Denza badges in Australia. The B5 and B8 are both based on a rugged ladder-frame chassis and employ BYD's 'DMO' platform, which refer to their PHEV powertrain technology. The Denza B5 sits on a 2800mm wheelbase, measures 4890mm long, 1970mm wide and 1920mm high, and features adjustable 'Disus-P' adjustable air suspension offering up to 310mm of ground clearance. Power comes from a 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine and a pair of electric motors - one on each axle - to deliver a combined output of 505kW of power and 760Nm of torque, and a claimed 0-100km/h time of 4.8 seconds. Total claimed range of 1020km (WLTP) includes 100km of electric-only driving, thanks to a 31.8kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack, while in Chinese-market versions the cabin mirrors that of the BYD Shark 6 launched in Australia earlier this year. The larger B8, meantime, delivers 550kW/760Nm outputs from its 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine and twin electric motors, and also offers 100km of EV-only driving as part of its claimed total range of 984km (WLTP). BYD claims the B8 offers the same 0-100km/h time of 4.8 seconds as the B5, despite the fact it sits on a longer 2920mm wheelbase and has a longer overall length of 5195mm. In comparison, the LandCruiser 300 Series has a 2850mm wheelbase and is 4965mm long. It also features BYD's adjustable 'DiSus-P' air suspension system, offering ground clearance of between 220mm and 310mm, and has a maximum water fording depth of 890mm. Driving modes include Snow, Mud, Sand, Wading, Mountain, Burst and Sport+, while the interior of the B8 we tested in China had swathes of leather on the doors, dash, seats and steering wheel, plus a massive 17.3-inch central touchscreen. The flagship B8 was also fitted with BYD's 'God's Eye' advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), which uses cameras, radars, LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors to offer functions including adaptive cruise control and BYD's Navigate on Autopilot system. As well as the B8 and B5 off-road SUVs, Denza is also tipped to bring the Z9 GT sports car - which features Porsche Panamera-like styling - as well as its D9 electric people-mover and N9 electric SUV to Australia.",Perth Now,2025-10-01T09:05:13Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au/lifestyle/motoring/byd-denza-b5-and-denza-b8-suvs-confirmed-for-australia-c-20204824,2025-10-01 17:26:59.746932,0.1529411764705881
Lake Pend Oreille: Economic Impact of Water Levels on Tourism and Recreation in Idaho Explored in New Study - Travel And Tour World,"The economic effects of changing water levels at northern Idaho's Lake Pend Oreille are being investigated by the University of Idaho (UI). Professors Timothy Nadreau and Steven Peterson recently gave a presentation at the ""What's Happening Up North"" economic summit that gave an overview of an ongoing study. Although the study is not yet complete, the local community and economic stakeholders were informed of its preliminary findings. It is anticipated that the full findings of the study will be presented at the Lakes Commission meeting on October 30, 2025. The lake's water levels are currently controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and this management has generated discussions about the possible economic impacts of variations. The study draws attention to a crucial issue: the negative impacts that lake level uncertainty has on the area's recreation and tourism industries. Given that tourism contributes significantly to local revenue, Peterson and Nadreau's study is regarded as a critical first step in comprehending and reducing these effects. Professors Peterson and Nadreau have employed a range of data sources to investigate the economic implications of fluctuating water levels on Lake Pend Oreille. The researchers have collected extensive historical data, including daily water levels dating back to 1980, credit card receipts, and even cell phone usage data to track spending patterns among visitors. This rich data set has allowed them to assess how much money is being spent by non-residents in the area. In addition to the numerical data, the professors conducted a survey to gain insight into the recreation habits of locals and their perceptions of the lake's fluctuating levels. The survey received an impressive 1,523 responses, which Peterson considered a remarkable result. According to the data gathered, approximately 35% of Bonner County's income is derived from recreation and tourism, emphasizing the importance of understanding how changes in lake levels could affect this vital sector. The professors also conducted interviews with local business owners and other stakeholders, with the majority of interviews completed. These interviews have further enriched the study's findings, providing valuable perspectives on the local economy and the challenges posed by inconsistent lake levels. The study has drawn attention to the broader implications for both the local economy and the quality of life in Bonner County. The economic contribution of recreation and tourism to Bonner County cannot be overstated. Peterson's research shows that 35% of the county's income is tied to the recreational activities that Lake Pend Oreille supports, such as fishing, boating, and water sports. The lake's water levels have a significant impact on these activities, with lower levels potentially making certain areas inaccessible or unsafe for recreational use. Tourism, in particular, is vulnerable to the uncertainty surrounding the lake's water levels. The study indicates that this uncertainty alone has a detrimental effect on visitors' decision-making and their willingness to spend money in the area. Peterson noted that this issue isn't just a modern problem -- recreational tourism has always faced volatility, with periods like the COVID-19 pandemic having a profound impact on local tourism trends. However, the uncertainty surrounding water levels seems to be an ongoing concern that continues to affect local businesses and the economy. The findings suggest that providing a more consistent and predictable water level would likely stabilize the tourism and recreation sectors. However, the current management by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may make this difficult to achieve. For local stakeholders, including business owners and residents who rely on these sectors for their livelihoods, the study could offer key insights into how future water level management could improve economic stability. At the summit, local politicians, including District 1 Rep. Mark Sauter, expressed support for the study, acknowledging its potential to create positive change for the community. Sauter indicated that the research conducted by the University of Idaho has been instrumental in providing scientific backing to the claim that the economy of the region is directly tied to the condition of Lake Pend Oreille. Sauter also mentioned that there may be opportunities for further studies, particularly one by the Idaho Water Research Institute. This proposed study would focus on the hydrology of the lake, offering a more comprehensive understanding of how water levels affect the broader ecosystem and human activity. By expanding the scope of the research, the region could gain more insight into how to balance environmental and economic needs in the face of changing water levels. The cooperation between local and state officials, as well as stakeholders from Pend Oreille County, Washington, reflects the importance of continued research into the lake's water management. According to Sauter, the research has been pivotal in creating a dialogue between various regions affected by the lake, from Idaho to Washington. As the research progresses, it is likely that more localized strategies will emerge, aimed at reducing the impact of fluctuating water levels on both tourism and local ecosystems. The upcoming Lakes Commission meeting on October 30, 2025, is expected to provide the final report on the study conducted by Peterson and Nadreau. This meeting, which will take place at the Sandpoint Center from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., is seen as a critical opportunity for the community and local stakeholders to learn about the complete findings and understand how they could influence future decisions on water management. Local stakeholders, business owners, and politicians alike are eager to see the results of the study, which could provide the evidence needed to advocate for more consistent water level management. Peterson and Nadreau's research may prove to be a crucial step in developing policies that prioritize the economic stability of the region while maintaining the ecological health of Lake Pend Oreille. The University of Idaho's investigation into the financial effects of Lake Pend Oreille's varying water levels provides important new information about how local economies and environmental factors are intertwined.

Better Business Bureau: Beware of health insurance scams,"I probably get 10 unsolicited calls a week telling me there's been a change in Medicare and wanting to be sure I'm getting all of the benefits I need (I'm also getting frequent calls about a new burial plan that I'm hoping I won't need anytime soon). Some callers actually purport to be from Medicare while others are from official-sounding but non-existent government agencies or other organizations. Many, maybe all, originate overseas. And the calls are likely to pick up when the Medicare open enrollment season starts on Oct. 15. The crooks may try to sell you an insurance plan that isn't very good or they might use your Medicare number and other information to bill Medicare for unnecessary products or services. I've gotten calls wanting to verify that I still have medical conditions I don't have, but the more people they call (and the technology lets them call many at once), the more likely they'll connect with someone who does have the condition and submit fraudulent bills to Medicare on their behalf. Some scams involve unethical medical practitioners. Phony calls about Medicare are just one kind of health insurance scam the FTC warns about. Another involves peddling a medical discount plan as full coverage health insurance. You pay for discounts on specific medical services or products that may or may not be as good as advertised, but such a plan isn't a substitute for health insurance. I wrote an earlier column about the FTC's enforcement action against a company called Simple Health that sold plans it claimed were comprehensive health insurance that would cover preexisting medical conditions, inpatient and emergency care, prescription drugs, and all the usual services health insurance covers. But tens of thousands of consumers ended up being stuck with substantial medical bills after finding out all they had bought were medical discounts or a limited benefit plan. Other health insurance scams the FTC warns about include scammers saying you need to pay a fee for a new Medicare card to retain your coverage or you need to pay a fee for help with the Health Insurance Marketplace. Research any company offering health coverage with the BBB and online using words like ""complaint,"" ""scam"" or ""fraud."" Read reviews to see what other people have said about the company. Visit a trusted source like Healthcare.gov to compare plans, coverage and prices. If you're shopping for comprehensive health insurance, be sure that's what you'll be getting rather than a medical discount plan (which may be okay if that's what you want). Companies selling health insurance have to be licensed by their state insurance commissioner. Be careful taking the salesperson's word about a license - telemarketers for Simple Health falsely claimed to be licensed insurance agents. Don't accept vague answers from a salesperson about benefits; ask to see a statement of benefits or a complete copy of the policy. If someone calls claiming to be affiliated with Medicare and asks for your Social Security number or bank account information to get a new card or new benefits, it's a scam. Never give personal information to a caller claiming to be affiliated with Medicare. You can't trust your caller ID. Scammers can make these calls look like they're coming from the government even when they're not.

Statistics Indonesia Reports August Trade Balance Surplus at US$5.49 Billion,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Statistics Indonesia (BPS) reported that Indonesia's trade balance in August 2025 experienced a surplus of US$5.49 billion. This figure is slightly higher compared to the previous month's surplus of US$4.17 billion. ""Indonesia's trade balance has recorded a surplus for 64 consecutive months since May 2020,"" said Deputy for Statistics Production M. Habibullah during the BPS press conference held online and offline on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. In August 2025, BPS recorded that the value of exports reached US$24.96 billion, which was a 5.78 percent increase compared to August 2024. Meanwhile, imports in August this year were recorded at US$19.47 billion, a 6.56 percent decrease from the same period the previous year. In August 2025, the surplus was primarily driven by a surplus in non-oil and gas commodities, which amounted to US$7.15 billion. The main contributors to the surplus were animal or vegetable fats and oils (HS15), mineral fuels (HS27), as well as iron and steel (HS72). Meanwhile, non-oil and gas commodities experienced a deficit of US$1.66 billion. The main contributors to the deficit were crude oil and oil products. Cumulatively, Indonesia's trade balance from January to August 2025 recorded a surplus of US$29.14 billion. It originated from a non-oil and gas sector surplus of US$41.21 billion, while the oil and gas sector had a deficit of US$12.07 billion. The United States was the top contributor to Indonesia's trade surplus from the beginning of the year until August 2025, amounting to US$12.20 billion. Indonesia also experienced the largest surplus with India and the Philippines, at US$9.43 billion and 5.85 billion, respectively.

"CID Alleges Digital Deletion, PAN Fraud  --  Was Zubeen Garg's Death a Tip of the Iceberg?","Shyamkanu Mahanta was taken into custody after being detained at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport shortly after midnight. In a dramatic twist in the high-profile probe into the death of legendary Assamese singer Zubeen Garg, two top suspects- North East India Festival chief organiser Shyamkanu Mahanta and Garg's manager Siddharth Sharma -- were arrested and brought to Guwahati early on Wednesday, closing a 13 day manhunt which has captivated the state. From documents and a CID FIR that have been made public to Pratidin Time, the Additional Secretary in the Union Home Ministry, Praveen Singh, at 12:42:51 PM IST on September 30, 2025, e mailed the Singapore Attorney General's chambers (fscons.singapore@mea.gov.in), requesting formally the mutual legal assistance so that the authorities in Singapore would arrest or extradite the accused mentioned in Assam CID case No. 18/2025. The request was copied to T. Prabhakar, First Secretary at the Indian Embassy in Singapore. Following that move, Assam police carried out coordinated arrests on the night of October 1. Shyamkanu Mahanta was taken into custody after being detained at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport shortly after midnight. Siddharth Sharma was arrested in transit near a tollgate in Gurgaon while travelling from Rajasthan to Delhi in the early hours of October 1. Both the men were flown back to Guwahati on Air India flight IX1197. The plane took off from Terminal 3, Delhi, at 04:39 AM and arrived at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, Borjhar, at 06:37 AM on October 1, 2025. A tight security cordon had been put in place at the Guwahati airport. Police claim both were taken from the plane through a cargo gate in a massive convoy and brought straight to the CID's guesthouse in Geetanagar and produced before the court. Court documents indicate the suspect showed up at the airport without handcuffs, although handcuffs were affixed to them when they were brought before the magistrate. Images of the two men in handcuffs within the CID headquarters lockup later flooded social media and newspapers, further generating controversy over the optics and the way the police had handled the case. The CID's FIR, filed by Senior Superintendent Ashif Ahmed, lists eight sections of the BNSS: 316(5), 336(3), 337, 338, 339, 340(2), 341(1) and 342(1). The FIR alleges multiple offences and incorporates evidence police say was recovered during searches at Mahanta's residence and offices. Investigators say they found, among other things, two PAN cards registered to the same company name -- 'TREND MMS' -- bearing PAN numbers AACTT1645G and AAGFT5093G. Officials have also allegedly confiscated official stamps and seals of various government and public works officials, such as a seal belonging to an assistant engineer of the SLOC cell of the public works department (ROADS) at Chandmari. The CID claims these items indicate probable financial misconduct and fictitious billings for public road works -- including PMGSY works in various districts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh -- amounting to crores of rupees over the past few years. One of the central pieces of evidence in investigators' case is the claimed control of such crucial digital content. CID sources indicate Zubeen Garg's mobile phone had supposedly been in manager Siddharth Sharma's custody following the singer's death in the days leading up. Sharma subsequently surrendered the phone to the police, but investigators claim the extended possession raised questions about possible tampering or erasure of evidence. The investigation has also targeted content online. Mahanta maintained two event websites -- for the North East Festival and Rongali Utsav -- that are said to have featured key documents and photographs. The police claim that the websites were shut down in late September. A September 24, 2025 e mail to Mahanta's colleague, Manna Deb, from a company called ITech Computer told them that ITech Computer was unable to host or keep up the two websites and provided them with 15 days in which to download materials. Inspectors report that the websites were actually disabled long before that 15 day window expired, which has raised new suspicions of intentional data destruction. Mahanta, who often used Facebook to speak to followers, live-streamed on 25 September 2025 claiming he had nothing to do with Garg's murder. He posted again on 29 September saying he would be coming back soon to Assam. On 30 September, however, his Facebook account was suspended, something investigators are looking very closely into. Previously, a look out notice also had been issued against Mahanta, officials added, and the unexpected arrests on the day the singer's 13 day funeral rituals were being celebrated have triggered heated public response in Assam. Loved ones of the deceased singer welcomed news of the arrests, while many called for an open, unbiased and swift investigation. Onlookers and the public have expressed doubt over procedure and timing. There are questions being raised regarding why the suspects were not held in custody sooner if police thought they had material evidence and whether influential networks had stalled action. Local leaders warned that any inability to get convictions would be regarded as a miscarriage of justice. The CID has arrested both men and brought them to 14 day custody and shifted them to its headquarters in Ulubari after fulfilling court formalities. As the case proceeds to the next phases, the Assam government and the Union Home Ministry have stated that they would co operate fully with any foreign legal requisites emerging from the investigation. With passions running high throughout Assam, citizens and civil society organizations are demanding a transparent probe and immediate legal action so the people -- who have been grieving the loss of a cultural icon -- can be assured that the rule of law has held fast.",Pratidin,2025-10-01T09:02:58Z,https://www.pratidintime.com/pratidin-exclusive/cid-alleges-digital-deletion-pan-fraud-was-zubeen-gargs-death-a-tip-of-the-iceberg-10519350,2025-10-01 17:26:59.748917,-0.2784313725490196
[Kitchen 143] A family food crawl with the Ford Explorer,"For families, the journey -- or in this case, the road trip -- to getting there is just as much fun as the meal Fun foodie adventures are something many look forward to as a way to bond with the family. It's where great conversations take place, and where our family and friends find themselves laughing or maybe even shedding a tear or two around the table over our bonding sessions. No matter the cuisine or fare, it's always about connection. Savoring the memories around the table is where love and togetherness truly come alive. But for our family of six, it's not just about the destination or the dish, it's also about the journey. And with that, I'm excited to highlight the journey -- or in this case, the road trip -- when getting ""there"" is just as much fun as the meal. We recently had the privilege to take the new Ford Explorer 2.3L Limited 4×4 for a spin as we ran errands for a week, went back and forth to work, invested in date night, and even took the whip out for a little road trip to Tagaytay. Nino was able to really let it out on the road with the power and precision of the Ford Explorer's engine and handling. The meals we enjoyed in between driving to our different appointments and stops made for a FUN Ford Food Crawl with the whole family. The Ford Explorer is perfect for a family adventure, no matter the season. With the sleek handling, it commands the road in the rain and keeps us cool in the heat of the summer. Equipped with premium comfort and advanced safety features, The New Explorer is built for drivers to command the road while keeping the family safe. Whether traveling in the city and navigating the tight turns of Manila's urban landscape or heading out to the province, making a rough road an easy drive, it embodies the strength and versatility of American ingenuity while delivering a smooth and comfortable ride for the whole family. In fact, that rainy night that we reserved a table for two at one of the best Filipino restaurants right here in Manila brought together American ingenuity and Filipino creativity to a whole new level of understanding for this Fil-Am. Run by husband-wife team Chef Jordy and Mia Navarra, Toyo Eatery has been included in the exclusive list of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants since 2018 and featured in Somebody Feed Phil earlier this year. With a heritage menu that provides opportunities for storytelling and a commitment to supporting local farmers and artisans, Chef Jordy continues to defy expectations of just how satisfying a Kamayan Feast can be when tradition meets thoughtful innovation. Meant to be enjoyed through a progression of bites, soup, appetizers, and ulam, served family style on banana leaves, each savory comes to the table with a meaningful back story. Honoring his childhood and rich culture of flavors, Chef Jordy brings diners through a joyful meal best enjoyed with family and friends. This is, by far, one of the best Kamayan meals Nino and I have ever experienced. After our trio of bites, we were served a series of five kinds of dried fish atop freshly steamed rice, beautifully gift-wrapped in banana leaf for that comforting, homegrown touch. The beauty of this second part of our meal was that it was immediately followed by the mains, which included plump, sweet fresh prawns sourced from Palawan, a crispy pata that was incredibly tender yet finished with the crispiest skin for that ultimate crunch satisfaction, and a classic pork BBQ offering an elevated experience with pork shoulder, belly, and butt, topped with a rich soy glaze and a char of smokiness. With each course, Nino and I were thoroughly entertained and inspired by the multiple layers of flavors, texture, and creative artistry on a banana leaf. From the curated cocktails to the dessert, where Nino shared with our server that it was the best avocado ice cream he had had in his life, this was a date night hard to forget. Safely riding home, the rain did not affect our short trip back to BGC, thanks to the Ford Explorer's confidence-inspiring safety features that keep precious cargo secure no matter the weather. It was time to shift gears for Sunday funday with the family by taking a ride to Tagaytay for a simple lunch after service. Our family always enjoys road trips, and the Ford Explorer is the perfect fit for a family of six. Roomy interiors provide maximum space and ease. Nino was able to open up the strength as we hit the highway to one of our favorite ""out of town"" destinations. With pastas and sammies that are simple and satisfying, we were blessed with some sunny weather, good food, great music (we loved the playlist in the cafe), amidst the greenery and fresh air. Even if it is on a busy main road, it felt peaceful and tucked away. Driving the Ford Explorer for a week's worth of errands, activities, events, and meals provided opportunities for convenience and connection. Whether it was Nino taking the wheel for a family cruise outside of Metro Manila or one of my meetings for the ADCOM for Learners with Disabilities, we moved in comfort and confidence. Surely safe for the family, for date night, and for every journey in between. ""I love that the new Ford Explorer gives me the thrill of performance and handling I look for as a car enthusiast, but at the same time, it delivers the safety and peace of mind I need as a dad,"" Nino said. ""The advanced safety features reassure me when my family is with me. I also appreciate the spacious luxury interior and smart tech that make family trips smoother and more fun. For me, it's rare to find an SUV that balances excitement, road presence, and practicality. This is a vehicle I can truly trust for both driving in the city and going out of town."" Easy to drive with a 10-speed automatic transmission, but even easier to ride as a passenger with creature comforts necessary of a ""passenger princess,"" including both heated and air conditioned seats, this Ford model also features ample leg room, outlets to charge phones or work on the laptop in the back seat, cup holders for both my coffee and my lemon water, and a magnetic charging station, while keeping my family safe. - Rappler.com",Rappler,2025-10-01T09:10:39Z,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/kitchen-143-family-food-crawl-ford-explorer/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.749524,0.4666666666666666
NRGene commercializes ToBRFV-resistant tomato seeds to combat viral disease,"Growers using the seeds report strong performance of the new virus-resistant solution, leading to high-quality fruits. Genomics company NRGene is advancing crop protection with the sale of tomato seeds integrated with its High Resistance (HR) trait. The HR trait imparts âenhanced and durableâ resistance to the Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV). The virus â"" causing yellowing or discoloration in leaves and brown wrinkled spots on fruits â"" is responsible for significant crop losses in key growing areas. This innovation is said to mark the first time HR-enhanced seeds will be available for farmers, following fruit quality and yield demonstrations in Switzerland and Canada during their 2024-2025 pilot sales. âThis milestone is more than just a first sale â"" itâs proof that our High Resistance trait is validated, reliable, and already protecting the yield of tomato growers,â says Dr. Gil Ronen, CEO of NRGene. âBy developing and applying efficient genomics markers, seed companies introduced this solution to the market faster, giving growers the confidence to keep producing despite ToBRFV.â The HR trait is licensed to various companies in Europe, South Africa, and the US, and to make adoption faster, NRGene provides DNA marker tools that help breeders quickly identify and insert the resistance trait into their best-performing tomato varieties. NRGene developed the seeds in partnership with the tomato breeding company Philoseeds in 2022. Within four years, the companies navigated the discovery to commercialization path, including introduction into elite hybrids, commercial trials in Europe and the US, and full commercialization to farmers. Netherlands-based HWSeeds is among the first to integrate the HR trait into its commercial tomato varieties, and is now in its second year of sales. The company has received positive customer feedback on the seed owing to the benefits of âreal high resistance,â says Roel Huisman, director of HWseed.Â âPlants are thriving under ToBRFV pressure, yields remain consistent, and fruit quality meets the expectations of demanding markets. This is not just another resistance â"" itâs a reliable, market-ready solution that restores grower confidence and strengthens our portfolio.â Commercial tomato grower PurNatur is the first to use HWseedâs resistant seeds, and also reported strong farm performance. Marco Stricker, director of PurNatur, stresses that the âresistance in actionâ led to healthy plants and high fruit quality. âThis is the kind of innovation that makes a real difference on the ground, giving us a powerful tool to combat ToBRFV and protect our farms from this devastating virus.â NRGene highlights that more breeding companies are following its trajectory and expects more businesses to adopt its HR trait to combat crop disease challenges.",foodingredientsfirst.com,2025-10-01T09:10:27Z,https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/nrgene-tobrfv-resistant-tomato-seeds.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.749818,0.2784313725490195

"ASEAN-CPTPP Ties Must Deliver Reforms, Not Symbolism - Experts","Sunway University economics professor Dr Yeah Kim Leng said Malaysia stands to gain significantly from deeper CPTPP collaboration, particularly in electrical and electronics, chemicals, medical devices, machinery and other resource-based manufacturing sectors. ""Efforts to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers among CPTPP members will boost demand for Malaysia's exports. ""This is particularly important under the current global environment of heightened uncertainties and geopolitical tensions,"" he said. Yeah also noted that Malaysia's participation in multiple trade blocs, namely the CPTPP, the RCEP, and the upcoming Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) -- a comprehensive agreement among ASEAN member countries -- would give it a competitive edge to serve as a regional hub. ""Malaysia is well-positioned to transform itself into a major regional production and trading hub, and also act as a bridge to foster trade among members with less connected markets,"" he said. Meanwhile, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd's chief economist, Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, said the CPTPP could act as a ""catalyst"" for Malaysian businesses, especially MSMEs, to scale up, but only if real investment is made in capacity building. ""MSMEs make up 96 per cent of businesses in the country. That means that financial literacy, digital savviness, and business planning must become core skills.

World shares are mixed as a US government shutdown adds to uncertainty,"U.S. futures sank and world shares were mixed after a U.S. government shutdown began on Wednesday. The future for the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.7%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Dow gained 0.2%, to set an all-time high. The Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher to 22,660.01. In early European trading, Germany's DAX lost 0.3% to 23,818.68 and the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% lower, to 7,890.60. Britain's FTSE rose 0.4% to 9,390.92. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.9% to 44,550.85 after the Bank of Japan reported a slight improvement in business sentiment among major manufacturers. The indications from the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey raise the odds that the central bank will increase its key interest rate to counter inflation that has topped its target range of about 2% for some time. Political uncertainty is also looming over Japan's markets, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party due to chose a new leader and prime minister later this week to replace embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Although markets and offices in mainland China are closed Oct. 1-8 for the National Day holiday, China's central bank said it plans a 1.1 trillion yuan ($160 billion) reverse repo operation on Oct. 9, to increase the amount of cash in circulation and stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,455.83, while Taiwan's Taiex added 0.6% on heavy buying of semiconductor-related shares. Markets appeared to be taking the U.S. shutdown, which took effect at midnight U.S. Eastern time, in stride. Past U.S. government shutdowns have had a limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. This shutdown could be different, with the White House prone to push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs won't derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Tuesday brought mixed reports on the U.S. economy. A Conference Board survey showed consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ""low-hire, low-fire"" state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that's neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, since a government shutdown would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday's on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. The Department of Labor has said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there's a lapse. The agency already was strained by Trump's firing of Erika McEntarfer as BLS commissioner on Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed a rapid slowdown in hiring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Late Tuesday, the White House said Trump was withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the bureau, according to an AP source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a White House action that hadn't been publicly announced. Early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 40 cents at $62.77 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 41 cents to $66.44 per barrel.

"Five Canadian provinces boost their minimum wage, Alberta now lowest","Five provinces are increasing their minimum wage today to support workers amid affordability issues. The hikes will apply to Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The provinces have tied their increases to Canada's steadily growing consumer price index, which is an indicator of inflation. Ontario's minimum wage is now $17.60 per hour, Nova Scotia's and Prince Edward Island's are $16.50 an hour, Manitoba's is $16 per hour and Saskatchewan's is $15.35 an hour. Alberta is the only province that has not boosted its minimum wage, with its $15-per-hour rate now the lowest in Canada.

Almost half of Canadians say they have seen systemic racism in their province: poll,"OTTAWA -- Almost half of Canadians polled say they have observed evidence of systemic racism in their province, a new survey suggests. The Leger poll of 1,627 people, conducted between Aug. 29 and 31 for the Association for Canadian Studies, says 49 per cent of Canadians reported having observed evidence of systemic racism -- racism embedded in government and social systems and laws -- in their province. The poll, which was conducted online and can't be assigned a margin of error, suggests that 37 per cent of those polled said they hadn't observed evidence of systemic racism in their province, while 14 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer. Jack Jedwab, president and CEO of the Association for Canadian Studies, said the number of people reporting systemic racism was ""a bit higher"" than he had expected, because he wasn't certain that Canadians had a good understanding of systemic racism. Citing the number of people who said they hadn't observed systemic racism -- or weren't sure if they had -- Jedwab called for more education about what systemic racism means and how it affects people. ""Clearly, 49 per cent, even though it's an important percentage of Canadians ... doesn't mean there's a systemic perception of it,"" he said. ""If the perception were systemic, it would be higher than 49 per cent."" Kanika Samuels-Wortley, Canada Research Chair in systemic racism, technology and criminal justice and associate professor at Ontario Tech University, said it's promising to see more Canadians identifying forms of systemic racism. Samuels-Wortley said it's likely the percentage of people reporting systemic racism in this poll is higher than it would have been in previous years. She said the murder of George Floyd in the U.S. opened up conversations about racism in public and in the media, while workplace training could be giving people the tools to identify systemic racism. ""To know that we are seeing Canadians identifying forms of bias that are having an impact on some of our citizens speaks to the fact that there is a growing consciousness of what it means for those who experience forms of systemic racism in our country,"" she said. The poll suggests 56 per cent of women surveyed reported having witnessed systemic racism, compared to 42 per cent of men. While 57 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 34 said they have observed evidence of systemic racism in their province, half of those aged 35 to 54 years old and 44 per cent of those 55 and older said the same. Fifty-three per cent of respondents in Quebec and 52 per cent of Ontarians said they've witnessed evidence of systemic racism in their provinces. Those figures were 41 per cent in Alberta and 42 per cent in B.C. Samuels-Wortley said she was not surprised to see the highest percentages of respondents reporting systemic racism in Ontario and Quebec, two provinces with large Black and Indigenous populations. She said she was surprised to see the lower percentages reporting systemic racism in Alberta and B.C., two provinces with large Indigenous populations. The poll suggests 73 per cent of those identifying as Black reported seeing evidence of systemic racism, compared to 49 per cent of other non-white respondents and 30 per cent of white respondents. At 52 per cent, poll respondents born outside of Canada were only slightly more likely to report evidence of systemic racism that those born in Canada, at 49 per cent. The polling industry's professional body, the Canadian Research Insights Council, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

"Mauritius leads, Zimbabwe trails in Africa's 2025 Economic Freedom Ranking","Mauritius remains Africa's most ""economically free"" country, according to the ""Economic Freedom of the World 2025"" report released on September 25, 2025, by the Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank. The report assesses the state of economic liberty across 165 countries and territories based on 45 distinct indices grouped into five broad categories. The categories measured are: Size of Government (including tax rates, public ownership, and government investment); Legal System and Property Rights (judicial independence, military interference, and police effectiveness); Sound Money (money supply growth, inflation, and foreign currency accounts); Freedom to Trade Internationally (average tariff rates, capital controls, and trade barriers); and Regulation (bank ownership, interest rate controls, and labor market rules). Each index is scored from 0 (least free) to 10 points (most free). These scores are then equally weighted and aggregated to create a value for each of the five major categories. A country's overall score, which also ranges from 0 to 10, is the average of the five category scores. Mauritius ranked 21st globally with an overall score of 7.76 points. The Indian Ocean island nation achieved its best performance in Freedom to Trade Internationally (8.76 points) and Sound Money (8.61 points). With a score of 7.58 points, the Seychelles ranked second in Africa and 31st globally. They were followed by Cape Verde (44th), Gambia (68th), Botswana (69th), Uganda (72nd), Kenya (81st), and South Africa (83rd). Morocco and Namibia tied for 94th place in the global ranking, completing the African Top 10. The continent's least economically free countries were Chad (156th globally), Libya (157th), Algeria (162nd), Sudan (163rd), and Zimbabwe (164th). Globally, Hong Kong maintained its position as the freest economy with a score of 8.85 points, ahead of Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States. The ranking also highlighted a strong statistical correlation between a nation's level of economic freedom and both its GDP growth rate and average income level. This correlation is attributed to the fact that economic agents operate more efficiently when they have the right to initiative and are motivated to innovate, work, and save.

KKR acquires minority stake in Adnoc gas pipeline assets | The National,"The value of the deal and size of the stake was not disclosed. KKR is acquiring a minority stake through its managed accounts, matching the type and tenure of the investment with long-duration capital, it said on Wednesday. The gas pipeline network connects Adnoc's upstream assets to offtakers in the UAE. Ownership and operational management will remain with Adnoc, the company said. The move will help KKR ""invest further in Abu Dhabi's long-term prosperity and critical infrastructure"", said David Petraeus, chairman of KKR Middle East. ""This investment reflects KKR's commitment to expand partnerships and investment across the Middle East,"" said Mr Petraeus, who is also the chairman of the KKR Global Institute. KKR, which has operated in the Middle East for more than 15 years, has been expanding its footprint in the region. It appointed Mr Petraeus, a former CIA director and one-time commander of US Central Command, to lead Middle East operations in April. The latest deal comes after KKR, along with the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, invested $4 billion in Adnoc's pipeline infrastructure in February 2019, acquiring a 40 per cent stake. Last year, the stake was acquired by Abu Dhabi-based global alternative investment management company Lunate. KKR also took a stake in one of the region's largest data centre firms, Gulf Data Hub, this year, to jointly invest more than $5 billion to boost the Dubai company's data centre infrastructure in the Gulf. In July, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company and funds managed by KKR also jointly acquired Canada-based CoolIT Systems. KKR, which had total assets under management of $686 billion at the end of the second quarter, said the latest deal will add to its $90 billion infrastructure portfolio. ""This strategic partnership leverages KKR's expertise in infrastructure investments and Adnoc's operational excellence to deliver practical energy solutions,"" said Cristina Gonzalez, KKR's managing director for infrastructure. The move comes as other private equity firms have also been expanding in the region. Buyout firms are keen to build teams on the ground, invest in local businesses and help develop the region's asset managers. In February, London-based private equity firm Permira said it planned to open an office in Dubai this year to expand its footprint in the Middle East. Last December, US-based private equity company General Atlantic said it was opening a new office in Abu Dhabi, its second in the Middle East after Riyadh, as it aims to build on its $1 billion of investments in the region. A private equity revival is starting to take shape globally following a rebound in deal-making in 2024, according to Bain & Company's Global Private Equity report released in March. Investments and exits were up 37 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, last year, it said. However, deal activity has been complicated globally due to uncertainty stemming from US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",The National,2025-10-01T09:09:24Z,https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/energy/2025/10/01/kkr-acquires-minority-stake-in-adnoc-gas-pipeline-assets/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.752823,0.1607843137254903

5 homes collapse into the surf of the Outer Banks as hurricanes rumble in Atlantic - WWAYTV3,"(AP)-Five unoccupied houses along North Carolina's Outer Banks collapsed into the ocean Tuesday as Hurricanes Humberto and Imelda rumbled in the Atlantic, the National Park Service said, marking the latest private beachfront structures to fall into the surf there in recent years. The homes, once propped on high stilts, collapsed in the afternoon in Buxton, a community on the string of islands that make up the Outer Banks, said Mike Barber, a spokesperson for the park service. No injures were reported, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore said in a post on social media. In videos shown by the local station 13News Now, homes teetered on stilts battered by the waves before plunging into the surf. The shoreline was clogged with debris, two-by-fours, cushions and an entire home as wave after wave rolled in from the Atlantic. The post said that more collapses were possible given the ocean conditions, and urged visitors to avoid Tuesday's sites, including areas several miles south to stay clear of debris. North Carolina's coast is almost entirely made up of narrow, low-lying barrier islands that have been eroding for years as the sea level rises. Seventeen privately owned houses have collapsed on Seashore beaches since 2020, the park service said. The first 15 were north of Buxton in Rodanthe, but a Buxton home fell into the surf two weeks ago. The threat to these structures often builds when storms affect the region, as is the case with the two latest hurricanes, even as they headed further out in the Atlantic. Portions of eastern North Carolina were subject to coastal flood advisories and warnings, the National Weather Service said, while dangerous surf conditions were expected in the area through the rest of the week. Ocean overwash on Tuesday also prompted the state Transportation Department to close a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 on Ocracoke Island. The ferry connecting Ocracoke and Hatteras islands also was suspended Tuesday, the department said.",WWAY TV,2025-10-01T08:56:22Z,https://www.wwaytv3.com/5-homes-collapse-into-the-surf-of-the-outer-banks-as-hurricanes-rumble-in-atlantic/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.753115,-0.207843137254902
"UPDATED: I inherited a near-collapse economy, the worst is over, Tinubu tells Nigerians","President Bola Tinubu said on Wednesday that his administration inherited a ""near-collapse"" company caused by decades of misgovernance in the country. The Nigerian leader said this in a broadcast to mark Nigeria's Independence Anniversary. He said the state of the economy caused his administration to take tough decisions, including removing ""the corrupt fuel subsidy..."" ""We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today,"" he said. He, however, said the initial negative impacts of his policies had started getting better, saying the ""worst is over."" ""Yesterday's pains are giving way to relief. I salute your endurance, support, and understanding,"" he said. ""Our macro-economic progress has proven that our sacrifices have not been in vain. Together, we are laying a new foundation cast in concrete, not on quicksand."" The president said the second quarter GDP grew by 4.23 per cent, the fastest in four years, and above the International Monetary Fund's 3.4 per cent forecast. Inflation, which had spiked following the removal of fuel subsidies and unification of exchange rates, fell to 20.12 per cent in August 2025, the lowest level in three years. He said non-oil revenue had reached a record N20 trillion by August, hitting the 2025 target months ahead of schedule, while September alone generated N3.65 trillion, 411 per cent higher than May 2023. Fiscal health had improved with the debt service-to-revenue ratio falling below 50 per cent from 97 per cent. The president also noted that external reserves rose to $42.03 billion in September, the highest since 2019. Nigeria's tax-to-GDP ratio increased to 13.5 per cent, up from less than 10 per cent, with a new tax law coming into effect in January to expand the base while giving relief to low-income earners. He said Nigeria recorded surpluses on trade for five consecutive quarters, with a 44.3 per cent rise in Q2 2025 to N7.46 trillion ($4.74 billion). Non-oil exports now represent 48 per cent of total exports compared with 52 per cent for oil. ""Nigeria is now selling more to the world than we are buying,"" Mr Tinubu said, calling the shift ""a fundamental change that strengthens our currency and creates jobs at home."" He said global investors and rating agencies were taking notice. Nigeria's stock market, he noted, had surged to 142,000 points in September 2025 from 55,000 points in May 2023. The Central Bank also cut interest rates for the first time in five years, citing improved macroeconomic stability. However, President Tinubu admitted that the real measure of progress went beyond numbers. ""The accurate measure of our success will not be limited to economic statistics alone, but rather in the food on our families' tables, the quality of education our children receive, the electricity in our homes, and the security in our communities,"" he said. The president acknowledged the high cost of living and urged citizens to embrace productivity and patriotism. ""Let us be a nation of producers, not just consumers. Let us farm our land and build factories to process our produce. Let us patronise 'Made-in-Nigeria' goods. I say Nigeria first. Let us pay our taxes."" ""My message is hope and a call to action... With Almighty God on our side, I can assure you that the dawn of a new, prosperous, self-reliant Nigeria is here,"" he concluded. In recent years, Nigeria has struggled with inflation, a weak currency and slowing growth. While President Tinubu's reforms, particularly fuel subsidy removal and naira unification, have been widely criticised for worsening hardship, the government insists they are critical for building a more resilient economy.",Premium Times Nigeria,2025-10-01T09:09:31Z,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/825018-updated-i-inherited-a-near-collapse-economy-the-worst-is-over-tinubu-tells-nigerians.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.753474,0.05882352941176472

""When the electronics sector attracted more of the market spotlight, nontech stocks largely moved in the doldrums with only some exceptions due to their ties with tech partners,"" Tang said. Teco Electric & Machinery Co. soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$104.50 on its partnership with Hon Hai to boost AI infrastructure capabilities. In addition, Taiwan Glass Industry Corp. gained 2.01 percent to end at NT$27.95 on reports that the company's glass fiber is used in AI-related devices. On the other hand, Asia Cement Corp. lost 0.83 percent to close at NT$323.80, and rival TCC Group Holdings Co. shed 2.10 percent to end at NT$37.35.

WB calls on Azerbaijan to bolster regional cooperation in water management,"BAKU, Azerbaijan, October 1. Azerbaijan should bolster regional cooperation in managing transboundary water resources, World Bank (WB) Country Manager for Azerbaijan Stefanie Stallmeister said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports. She noted that in the global context, cooperation and multilateral approaches are even more important to address the challenges of climate change. ""Azerbaijan faces a serious water shortage. Moreover, 70 percent of the country's water resources come from transboundary sources, which increases dependence on other countries and highlights the importance of regional cooperation. I wouldn't call it innovative, but the management of transboundary water resources and proper basin management become even more important as the impact of climate change on the region increases. The most critical point is what Azerbaijan can do. The main goal is to ensure more efficient and productive use of water. To this end, Azerbaijan is already doing a number of things. One of these is the modernization of irrigation systems. This is extremely important in terms of ensuring that existing water is used without wastage,"" she explained. The WB official articulated that the subsequent initiative pertains to climate-smart agricultural practices.. ""Azerbaijan is already taking some steps in this direction, but I am sure that more needs to be done, because the need has increased. For example, the introduction of new plant varieties and seeds that are more resistant to drought and salt is very important. All of this is critical to overcoming the challenges. Here again, global cooperation can be useful. For example, in the field of preparation of these seeds, development and application of technologies, organizations such as the WB and the Asian Development Bank can help in knowledge exchange and create partnerships. So there is no need to invent everything from scratch,"" she emphasized. Azerbaijan ascended to membership within the World Bank framework in the year 1992. The World Bank has been engaging with Azerbaijan through a multitude of initiatives and strategic frameworks for over three decades, emphasizing economic diversification and the enhancement of public service delivery mechanisms.

Asian Development Bank keen to boost investment in Azerbaijan's private sector,"BAKU, Azerbaijan, October 1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to increase investment in Azerbaijan's private sector, ADB Country Manager for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, Marina Rose, said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports.

Emirates becomes first airline to BAN power banks - is yours unsafe?,": Airline announces world-first ban of popular travel device onboard Plane passengers are being urged to think twice before packing power banks as major airlines clamp down on their use - while a number of popular carriers opt to ban them entirely. In recent months, a number of airlines have already put strict rules in place that prohibit passengers from bringing power banks in checked luggage going into the hold. This is due to the risk of lithium batteries overheating and causing fires in the cargo hold. If damaged, lithium-ion batteries can create aggressive fires and release highly toxic fumes - a process known as thermal runway. Giuseppe Capanna, of Electrical Safety First, said 'Lithium-ion batteries can hold a sizable amount of energy in a very small space, and can pose a serious fire risk if they become damaged or are manufactured to a substandard level.' Following a spate of incidents that have sparked safety concerns, a number of airlines, such as Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Air, and, most recently, Emirates, have banned the use of power banks on their flights. Safety experts have now revealed the signs Brits should be aware of that may indicate their power bank may be an increased fire risk. According to Capanna, the biggest tell-tale sign is if your power bank begins to bulge, swell or change shape. Following a spate of incidents that have sparked safety concerns, a number of airlines, such as Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Air, and, most recently, Emirates, have banned the use of power banks on their flights He said: 'Swollen power banks are a sign of an internal failure and it may mean the device is at serious risk of catching fire, sparking a dangerous process called thermal runaway, where toxic fumes are expelled and a fire occurs. 'If you notice any damage or deformation to your power bank when you're packing for your holiday abroad, don't bring the device with you. 'Instead, safely dispose of it as soon as possible at a local recycling centre that has dedicated facilities for electronics and batteries.' The expert advised passengers to 'always follow airline rules' and to ensure power banks are kept in cabin bags instead instead of checked luggage. He warned: 'If you spot any signs of damage or deformation while flying, alert airline staff straight away.' Passengers are further urged to purchase their power banks from reputable high street retailers, stay up-to-date with product recalls and safety notices, and keep devices away from heat sources, such as sunlight, and liquids, such as water. In June, passengers on an airplane were left terrified after the cabin filled with smoke following an explosion of a power bank just 15 minutes into a flight. Video footage showed passengers panicking as thick, acrid smoke began billowing out of an overhead locker. Pictured: a damaged power bank Pictured: a damaged power bank People could be heard shouting at each other, and opening it up to find one passenger's camera battery and power bank smouldering in a locker. A flight attendant appeared with a small fire extinguisher to put out the fire. The incident took place on China Southern Airlines flight CZ6850 from Hangzhou to Shenzhen in China on Saturday, May 31. The pilot of the plane was forced to return to Hangzhou International Airport after the passenger's power bank ignited shortly after take-off.",Daily Mail Online,2025-10-01T09:02:02Z,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-15151271/Emirates-airline-BAN-power-banks-completely-heres-check-unsafe.html,2025-10-01 17:26:59.755035,-0.08235294117647063
"I'm 61 and scared to retire. I have $650,000 saved but wish I had more  --  I should've gotten into real estate sooner.","Despite financial growth, he feels insecure about retirement and wishes he had invested earlier. I got my first job at 17 and worked mainly dead-end jobs at restaurants, in construction, and at mini-marts. I was a late bloomer and started college in 1993 at 30. I graduated with a bachelor's and a master's degree in communications and moved to Kansas to take a full-time position teaching at the community college level. The job offered a state program called KPERs, a retirement program with some matching. I participated and contributed a small amount, which started my retirement journey. My partner and I lost our firstborn child, and it was too hard to stay there. I then went to work for a college in Indiana. They also offered retirement benefits, such as matching, which I participated in. I worked there from 2002 to 2004. I left Indiana and got a job at a college in Washington, where my daughter was born in 2005. I worked there for the next 20 years and just quit in June. I then sold it in 2019 for around $70,000 profit -- it paid off all my old student loans, credit card debt, and car payments. I moved to Maine in 2022 and still taught remotely. I bought another property in Washington in 2021, sold it in 2023, and made a nice profit on it. I bought a third property in Maine. We lived there for two years before deciding to move to Tennessee. I was unable to find full-time academic work in Maine, so I relocated for better job prospects. I rent the condo in Maine to a family member, so the mortgage is covered while I pay rent in Tennessee. About five years ago, I started contributing 7% of my income to retirement, which my employer matched. I was making enough money, so I invested an extra $200 a month. As I was consistent, my portfolio grew. When I was 59 years old, my retirement accounts hit $500,000. I also received a small inheritance of $70,000 from my mom when she died in 2022. Along with my savings, that's close to another $100,000 for my retirement. I've got about $100,000 in equity in my real estate. So, my retirement nest egg is about $650,000 thus far. In my retirement journey, I've held many jobs. I worked for the Postal Service, but I quit because I was working too much for too little pay. Now, I'm working part-time at Cabela's and part-time teaching. I'm nervous. My ex-wife and I divorced in 2006. I'm single and building my retirement nest egg alone. Even though $650,000 sounds like a lot, it isn't. If I've lived off $50,000 a year, my retirement savings will only last about 12 years. I have some medical issues that may make my life a little shorter than the average person's, but I don't know about being 71 and still working, and I worry I could run out of money. In my 70s, I don't want to rely on Social Security and public housing. I'm working on securing another job in Tennessee. I'll put in another four years to get to 65 and probably retire, unless I love my job. Then, I could start taking Social Security. I've made a lot of money off the real estate I've owned and sold. Real estate boosted me financially in my mid-to-late fifties. I'm frustrated because I'm a creative person. I'd like to spend my life doing creative work, whether I make money or not, such as writing, music, songwriting, or photography. Now, I'm stuck working 50 to 60 hours a week at various jobs, and it's exhausting. I don't like any of the jobs that I've had; they're means to an end. I wish I had started putting money away earlier, and that's the advice I would give young people. Of course, working dead-end jobs is hard, and you barely make it paycheck to paycheck. I probably would've started adding a little extra once I got a job with matching programs because that's where it adds up.",Business Insider,2025-10-01T09:05:01Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/boomer-saved-650000-retirement-fears-not-enough-2025-10,2025-10-01 17:26:59.755463,0.0117647058823529
"One thing responsible for 21,000 accidents and every driver does it","Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info Drivers are being warned about the hidden dangers of parking after new government figures revealed parked cars were involved in thousands of crashes. New Department for Transport (DfT) data obtained by the online parking marketplace, YourParkingSpace, shows 20,896 reported collisions were caused by a stationary or parked vehicle blocking drivers' vision between 2014 and 2024. The figures reveal that parked cars were linked to more accidents than drug drivers (15,647), tired drivers (13,665) and defective road surfaces (13,116) over the same period. They were also responsible for more than four times as many crashes as mobile phone use (4,247). YourParkingSpace spokesperson Larne O'Donoghue said: ""These figures highlight how dangerous parked or stationary vehicles can be when they obstruct a driver's view. Motorists need to think twice before leaving their car on the roadside - and drivers passing by should always be on the lookout."" Other vision-blocking hazards flagged by the DfT include blinding headlights, awkward road layouts, overgrown hedges, buildings, road signs, street furniture and spray from other vehicles. To avoid the risks of roadside parking, YourParkingSpace is urging drivers to book safer, off-street alternatives. The platform lets motorists pre-book spaces in car parks, on private driveways or at supermarkets, hotels and train stations. Larne added: ""By reserving a space in advance, drivers can dodge the dangers of roadside parking. It's safer, more convenient - and makes perfect sense when heading to busy areas or big events.""",Plymouth Herald,2025-10-01T09:02:05Z,https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/one-thing-responsible-21000-accidents-10540620,2025-10-01 17:26:59.755683,-0.1607843137254902
"RBI holds repo rate at 5.5 pc, eases prudential norms, confirms UPI will stay free","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra cautioned that global headwinds and recent US tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian exports could dampen external demand The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on 1 October, Wednesday, left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent with a neutral stance, marking its second consecutive pause after three rate cuts earlier this year. The decision was unanimous and announced by governor Sanjay Malhotra as the central bank unveiled its fourth bi-monthly policy review of FY26. While keeping borrowing costs steady, the RBI moved to support credit growth through prudential easing, which involves relaxing regulatory norms that govern how much capital banks must set aside for lending. The measures include lowering risk weights and easing liquidity coverage requirements, which will enable banks to lend more freely to businesses and households. Malhotra stressed that this step was meant to balance financial stability with growth. ""No rate cut does not mean no support,"" he said, signalling that the central bank remains growth-friendly even as it awaits the cumulative impact of its earlier rate reductions.",National Herald,2025-10-01T09:05:44Z,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/business/rbi-holds-repo-rate-at-55-pc-eases-prudential-norms-and-confirms-upi-will-stay-free,2025-10-01 17:26:59.755837,0.09019607843137245
"Environment pollution - Micronesia - Oil leaks from WWII Japan shipwreck in Micronesia, emergency declared","Oil has leaked from a Japanese ship sunk in Micronesia's Chuuk Lagoon during World War II, prompting a declaration of a state emergency due to the risk to marine life and fishing economy, according to the island country's government. In a recent address at the 80th U.N. General Assembly in New York, Micronesian President Wesley Simina called on the international community to jointly contain the leakage, describing it as an incident that ""far exceeds"" his country's capacity to handle alone. ""These remnants of war now threaten our fisheries, our communities and our livelihoods,"" he said. It remains unclear how much oil had leaked from the wreckage. The Chuuk State government has also requested support from Japan and the United States. The leakage originates from the Rio de Janeiro Maru, owned by a predecessor of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, that was sunk by the U.S. military in 1944, according to the state government. The ship was used in military operations after it was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy in October 1940. The Japanese Embassy in Micronesia told Kyodo News on Monday it will study whether Japan ""needs to take concrete measures"" to address the situation. Divers discovered the leakage earlier this month, and the oil has since spread to nearby islands, according to the state government. U.S. air raids in February 1944 sank dozens of ships in the area.

UK brands that are 'too polite to be bold' losing $10bn - DecisionMarketing,"UK brands are being urged to put their manners to one side and keep rocking the boat again and again, with short-term marketing tactics and gaps in brand building costing them up to $10bn in value. That is according to Kantar's BrandZ Top 75 Most Valuable UK Brands report, which reveals that, globally, a brand's ""X-Factor"" contributes 33% of the total value of a company but in the UK, this figure drops to 29%. Kantar BrandZ analysis reveals that, while UK brands are good at meeting consumer needs and are generally well known, they often struggle to differentiate themselves from the competition, which is putting a ceiling on their growth. Kantar Insights UK & Ireland head of brand activation Jodie Gillary explained: ""We know strong brands perform better, are more resilient and grow faster in the long run. And this isn't just theory - our data shows that brand perceptions really can move the needle commercially. ""It's a tough time for the industry and, with pressure on margins right now, marketers are being pushed to do more with less. But the reality is that almost half of the UK's most valuable brands (45%) aren't seen positively enough to justify charging a higher-than-average price for their category, so it's never been more important for businesses to grasp the financial imperative of investing in considered brand building."" Gillary maintains that a continued focus on disruption is crucial to standing out from the competition. She added: ""British brands are at risk of being too polite to be bold. They can and should be braver. Disruption within a category has been responsible for 71% of incremental brand value growth for the top 100 brands globally since 2006. That's $6.6 trillion in additional value. But our data shows that UK disruptor brands are down 19% in value since 2019. ""It's not that British brands don't have it in them to be disruptive - there are some fantastic examples of businesses which have broken the mould. It's that when they do shake things up, they tend to only do it once, and that's not enough. This is the marketing paradox; brands need to put their manners to one side and keep rocking the boat again and again - and always in a way that's both distinct to the brand and in step with society's changing culture."" HSBC, with a brand value of $21.6bn, up 14% year on year, is the UK's most valuable brand for the first time ever, pushing Vodafone ($18.5bn) into second place. Financial services brands made up 9 of the top 10 fastest growing UK brands this year. By contrast, the lead category in France is luxury, with business tech taking the top spot in Germany and apparel in Spain. The strong performance of Britain's financial services brands contributed to the UK top 75, reversing last year's decline to grow by 8% overall in 2025. However, this still lags global counterparts whose values rose by an average 29%. At a national level, European markets are outpacing the UK with the leading brands in countries including the Netherlands and Spain recording double-digit growth. Outside of the financial services sector, British Airways was another high performer in the UK ranking, climbing 11 places to number 55. Dettol entered the ranking for the first time, shooting to the top half of the most valuable brands at number 34. Analysis from Kantar and the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School finds that companies which have particularly strong brand equity deliver abnormally high share price returns, and have greater resilience to crisis and uncertainty. Gillary explained: ""When the economy is struggling, businesses clearly have to do more to convince people that their products and services are worth spending on. ""The brands which manage to do that and grow fastest over the long term aren't necessarily the biggest or the cheapest - they're the ones which set themselves apart from competitors and in a way that chimes with what consumers want and need. That will look different for every brand, whether it's through product innovation, for example, branching into new categories, or standout digital experience. The key is never to stand still - to consistently shake things up while staying absolutely true to the brand.""",decisionmarketing.co.uk,2025-10-01T09:08:45Z,https://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/top-story/uk-brands-that-are-too-polite-to-be-bold-losing-10bn,2025-10-01 17:26:59.756459,0.1294117647058823
Liverpool legend John Barnes declared bankrupt after company racks up £1.5m debt,"John Barnes has been declared bankrupt after running up debts of more than £1.5m through his media firm. A bankruptcy order was issued in the High Court of Justice last week before being published in the London Gazette on Tuesday. The issue stems from his now-liquidated company John Barnes Media Limited, of which the Liverpool legend had been banned from being a director for three and a half years due to the debts. Liquidators' reports show he owed HMRC £776,878 in unpaid VAT, National Insurance, and PAYE, alongside £461,849 to unsecured creditors and a £226,000 directors loan. Barnes has so far paid back £60,000 after agreeing to return the directors loan in instalments. The former winger, who was the first player to earn £10,000-a-week, has faced multiple bankruptcy petitions since 2010, including one in 2023 which related to a £238,000 personal tax bill that was settled at the final hour. Barnes previously revealed how he has been poorly guided financially over the years and spoke on the All Things Business podcast about the eye-watering amount he has had to give to the taxman. ""Like a lot of elite sportspeople, I got burned because I trusted people, I got caught out a couple of times and ended up losing between £1m and £1.5m over four years,"" he said in August. ""In 2017, I began talking to HMRC about what I could do to repay what I owed."" The 61-year-old said that he has repaid £2.2m since 2017 and continues to pay £10,000 each month. Barnes also addressed what he claims are misleading reports about his financial affairs, reaffirming his commitment to repaying what he owes. He added: ""I know how hard it is for people out there. I don't want to say there are loopholes, or that I can get away with this or that, or have people think I can be made bankrupt and keep my assets, because I've already sold everything. I don't have any assets. ""But every time something new comes up, stories appear in the press saying negative things about how I am not paying my taxes, even though I'm going to court, not to be made bankrupt, but to ask for permission to keep paying. ""Football is a working-class sport, and I don't want hard working people thinking I've got all this money and I won't pay tax. It would be easy to be made bankrupt because they can't take anything else from me.""

"RBI's steady and cautious outlook gives confidence to businesses, investors: Industry chambers","New Delhi, Oct 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) Leading industry chambers on Wednesday expressed delight on the RBI's move to keep the repo rate steady at 5.5 per cent with a 'neutral' stance, saying that this shows a balanced approach to supporting growth while keeping an eye on inflation. After the earlier 100 bps rate cut this year, the RBI's steady and cautious outlook gives confidence to businesses, investors, and the broader economy. ""By balancing the twin objectives of growth and price stability, the policy sends out a reassuring signal to businesses and investors. Stable interest rates will help corporates plan long-term investments with greater clarity, while providing comfort to consumers through predictable borrowing costs,"" said Assocham President, Sanjay Nayar. Key sectors such as banking, infrastructure and automobiles are expected to benefit from steady demand conditions, backed by a conducive financing environment. ""This move also reinforces confidence in India's macroeconomic resilience and its ability to attract global capital,"" Nayar mentioned. Further, for commodity-linked industries, the policy signals stability as the RBI's neutral approach reduces the risk of immediate rate hikes. This will help moderate input cost pressures and support consumption-led demand in sectors like FMCG, infrastructure and manufacturing. The decision also provides clarity for investors, strengthening confidence in India's growth outlook. The RBI's decision reinforces India's economic stability, sending a positive signal to global partners like the US. While it doesn't directly affect trade tariffs, steady policy strengthens investor confidence and supports efforts to enhance bilateral trade and investment ties. Assocham further said that RBI's decision will provide stability to Indian rupee, helping it avoid sharp fluctuations at a time when global investors closely monitor interest rate moves by central banks such as the US Fed or the ECB. On inflation, the RBI decisions signal a careful balance between supporting growth and controlling inflation.

Cookie compliance crackdown: SHEIN fined €150 million by CNIL,"A significant warning shot to retailers echoed across Europe this month, with CNIL fining SHEIN €150 million for failing to comply with French law in relation to cookies compliance. The French Data Protection Authority imposed this significant fine on INFINITE STYLES SERVICES CO. LIMITED, the Irish subsidiary of the SHEIN group. Background CNIL investigated ""shein.com"" in August 2023 to chart a user's journey on the website. This investigation identified potential non-compliance with the French Data Protection Act in relation to cookies. Following the inspection of the website and engagement with SHEIN, CNIL issued a report notifying SHEIN of infringements of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act. CNIL noted that the fine against SHEIN is part of its overall compliance strategy initiated more than five years ago regarding cookies. CNIL has targeted particular operators of high-traffic websites and services. This mirrors the approach of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK issuing warning letters to non-compliant websites in late 2023 and in 2024. These letters were sent to the most visited websites in the UK regarding breaches of UK data protection laws in relation to cookies. The companies were provided 30 days to bring their cookie framework into compliance. French Data Protection Act and Equivalent UK Law Provision The EU ePrivacy Directive was transposed into French Law through the French Data Protection Act. Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act states that a user of electronic communications services must be informed in a clear and comprehensive manner by the controller or representative regarding: It also provides any placing of cookies can only take place where the user has expressly provided their consent after receiving this information. In the UK, the EU ePrivacy Directive was implemented through the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (PECR). PECR similarly provides that users give their informed and specific consent before cookies are stored on their devices. Breaches of cookies laws by SHEIN CNIL held that SHEIN's cookie framework was non-compliant on the following grounds: Calculation of fine CNIL stated that the fine reflected the following key considerations: 1. The company's failure to meet multiple regulatory requirements, including deploying cookies without user consent, disregarding user preferences, and providing inadequate information to users. 2. CNIL's regulatory committee emphasised that since 2020, it has consistently penalised organisations for similar non-compliance in relation to cookies and has publicised these decisions. 3. The substantial scale of the data processing activities by SHEIN given the company's dominant position in the online fast-fashion market. CNIL specifically highlighted the approximately 12 million French residents accessing the ""shein.com"" website monthly. UK Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 A key consideration for retailers in the UK is the changes to PECR regarding cookie consent requirements under the UK Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA). These changes (once in effect) will allow organisations to set some types of cookies without having to get consent, provided specific conditions are met. The DUAA will significantly increase the maximum fines for breaches of PECR. The maximum fine for a breach of PECR to increase from £500,000 to £17,500,000, or 4% of the organisation's total annual worldwide turnover from the preceding financial year. This will bring the level of potential fines for PECR breaches in line with GDPR. Once this comes into effect, the potential consequences for retailers for non-compliance in relation to cookies will be far more severe. Key takeaways for retailers On the back of this CNIL fine imposed on SHEIN for a non-compliant cookie framework, all retailers must implement the following key measures: 5. Ensure awareness of increased PECR penalties within the business Given the upcoming legislative changes in the UK, retailers should: 6. Monitor regulatory developments Retailers should watch out for the commencement date for the upcoming DUAA provisions in relation to cookies, and any regulatory guidance from the ICO. Conclusion Cookie compliance is often viewed as an afterthought by organisations, and a low-risk area with minimal enforcement. The €150 million fine imposed on SHEIN by CNIL should send alarm bells ringing through the ears of all DPOs and compliance teams of retailers. This reflects a clear regulatory focus on websites with heavy traffic, which will encompass many retailers. In assessing the level of fine, CNIL also took into account the fact companies are now expected to have a strong understanding of cookie compliance. All retailers are now on notice that a robust cookie compliance framework is expected and should implement the measures noted above to ensure compliance. Further steps Finally, it is also worth highlighting the potential impact on digital marketing campaigns and other important interactions which rely upon website functionality. As well as imposing a heavy fine, regulatory intervention is likely to severely disrupt these key business operations. Given the incoming increase in the level of fines the ICO can impose for breaches of PECR, all UK retailers need to undertake a detailed cookie audit to ensure the business's approach to cookies is compliant with PECR. Looking at the broader picture, businesses should already be preparing to address changes to the UK's data protection regime introduced by the DUAA. These important changes mean that businesses need to review their data flows and update processes dealing with data sharing arrangements, complaints handling and transparency requirements such as privacy notices. We would recommend that reviewing cookie compliance also forms part of this data audit.",Lexology,2025-10-01T09:08:51Z,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a65bee0f-f0f6-4670-b141-71cc28bd5341,2025-10-01 17:26:59.757648,-0.02745098039215688
UAPB lands $2 million from Thurgood Marshall College Fund - Talk Business & Politics,"The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) announced it has been awarded $2,000,000 by the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) to launch PRIDE RISES, or Prioritizing Recruitment to Innovate and Drive Enrollment: Reimagining Institutional Strategy for Enrollment Success. This institution-wide initiative will strengthen enrollment pipelines, modernize student services, and build long-term fiscal sustainability through a coordinated, data-driven approach. UAPB is one of eight HBCUs to receive a total of $16 million in grant funding. ""PRIDE RISES is a bold, student-responsive plan to modernize how UAPB recruits, enrolls, and supports learners of every pathway, including first-time freshmen, transfer, adult and nontraditional, international, and returning students,"" said Chancellor Anthony Graham. ""With targeted resources, modern technology, and cross-campus coordination, we will rebuild our pipelines and deliver the high-touch, data-informed supports students deserve.""

Does 'check-in chicken' really help you score a better airline seat?,"Cruising Altitude is a weekly column about air travel. Have a suggestion for a future topic? Fill out the form or email me at the address at the bottom of this page. Ever heard of check-in chicken? It's the idea that if you wait until the last minute to check in for your flight, you have a better chance of getting a good seat - if you haven't already paid for a seat assignment. And sure, maybe it'll work out. However, the longer I've written about flying, and the more I've flown, the less I believe in any hack. You might get lucky, but you're just as likely to get stuck in a back-row middle seat if you wait to check in on a basic economy ticket. The only real hack to getting what you want on a flight these days is to pay for it. If you decide to play the odds with your seat assignment, here's what you need to know. Airlines tend to be secretive about their operations, everything from how they price flights to how they assign seats. In general, the trend seems to be that once check-in opens, passengers without seat assignments are given open seats back to front. Airlines are betting that some passengers will be willing to pay a little extra just before departure for a seat closer to the front. ""You're playing a game of odds,"" Katy Nastro, a travel expert and spokesperson for Going, a company that tracks airfare deals, told me. ""They want to keep that option open for people who are willing to pay. That's ancillary revenue they can get right up to the last minute."" Travelers who have status with the airline are also likely to be assigned better seats if they're getting to the flight without one already selected. Maybe. The best way to be sure you're going to wind up in a seat you're happy with is to pay for a seat assignment in advance If you do decide to wait, the time you check in is just one factor in determining the seat you ultimately end up with. ""There is no foolproof method,"" Nastro said. ""There is no exact tactic and exact timing."" Still, Nadia Henry, a travel adviser who goes by Sparkle professionally, told me that she has had some luck in playing the waiting game - especially when she's flying ultra-low cost carriers. ""My strategy is always to wait to check in to get my seat assignment,"" she said. ""I don't know if that's good or that's bad, but it's been working in my favor. If I wait (until) two or three hours to check in before my flight, I'm always put in a favorable seat."" Last week's Cruising Altitude: Are airlines making a mistake with their big push for premium travelers? Sparkle acknowledged, though, that waiting can come with its own risks. ""I've also heard of you not checking in, and they can give your seat up,"" she said. ""I never wait until the last, last minute to check in, and I always make sure I check in at least two hours before that window."" Even for elite frequent flyers, it pays to have a strategy as well, because an early check-in can help with upgrades. ""If you're checking in early, you're bettering your odds at getting a higher place on that upgrade list,"" Nastro said. But that, too, comes with obscure caveats. Upgrade priority is determined by a variety of factors including status level; whether or not you hold a co-branded credit card; how many miles you've accrued; how much you've spent with the airline in the status year and more. Check-in time is just one of those many elements. Nastro said the best thing to do is to be nice and speak to an airline representative in person. ""I've had this work more often than not, where if I choose not to pay for a better seat and flying on an airline I don't typically fly, I will always go up to the gate agent,"" she said. ""They often are able to assist me."" Don't take it personally if they can't help you, though. The flight might be full, or there could be other reasons they're unable to move you to your seat, including safety. If a flight isn't fully loaded, weight and balance become an issue, and passengers may have to be in specific seats to make sure the aircraft can take off and land safely. That's also why you shouldn't just move your seat before checking with the crew. ""When you're on a flight that's not full, you'll often see people asking (to move). I would always suggest people ask, not just move your seat,"" Nastro said. If you're still not happy and the flight isn't completely full, try throwing money at the problem and treating yourself to an upgrade. Your knees will thank you.

SARS is coming after these wealthy South Africans,"SARS is tightening enforcement on wealthy South African expatriates, warning that failing to formally cease tax residency could leave high-income earners abroad facing unexpected local tax liabilities. According to the 2025 Henley Private Wealth Migration Report, South Africa is projected to lose approximately 250 dollar-millionaires in 2025 alone, signalling a continued outward migration of high-income individuals. Despite this, the number of taxpayers formally ceasing tax residency with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to protect their worldwide income from local taxation appears to be declining. This is according to Tax Consulting SA's team lead of cross border taxation, John-Paul Fraser, and process specialist of expatriate tax, Shuanita de Wet. ""This may be a costly oversight for wealthy South African expatriates in an era of stricter enforcement and fewer exemptions,"" Fraser and De Wet said. SARS is busy tightening its grip on compliance and eyeing higher revenue collection, with high earners firmly in the spotlight. ""The 2025 Budget Speech underscored the reality that individuals earning above R1 million per year remain the backbone of the country's tax base,"" they said. In 2024/25, individual taxpayers in this income bracket represented 6.7% of registered taxpayers but contributed 46% of South Africa's total personal income tax. In 2025/26, that figure stands at an estimated 7.3% of taxpayers paying 48.6% of all personal income tax. This shows the financial weight of South Africa's tax system clearly rests heavily on the shoulders of high-income earners, Fraser and De Wet said. ""At the same time, tax professionals warn that this is also the group of taxpayers who are highly mobile and can easily move abroad,"" they said. Earlier in 2025, SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter revealed findings from the tax authority's High Wealth Individual Unit (HWIU), which collects data on individuals owning more than R50 million in assets. The unit found that about 2,800 individuals fit that category, with a combined R150 billion of assets offshore. ""SARS statistics reveal an interesting trend,"" Fraser and De Wet said. ""In 2014, 4,102 taxpayers earning above R1 million formally declared a change in tax residency."" ""By 2023, that number had dropped to 1,722 taxpayers. So, while a large number of South Africans are still believed to seek new opportunities abroad, fewer individuals are formally exiting the tax system."" Fraser and de Wet pointed out that this raises an important question of whether all those who leave the country correctly update their tax residency status with SARS. ""If not, they may be in for an unpleasant surprise, as failing to formally cease tax residency can result in unexpected tax liabilities in South Africa, especially as SARS continues to cast its net wider,"" they warned. They said that, in practice, they are increasingly seeing SARS scrutinising taxpayers' financial backgrounds. SARS is making detailed requests for, among other things, company interests and involvement, company financials, rental income, capital gains tax calculations, and crypto-related information. These requests often follow the submission of an application for a SARS Notice of Non-Resident Tax Status, which is the official confirmation that one has ceased to be a tax resident of South Africa. ""In this new era of enforcement, it is essential for South African expatriates and high-income earners to understand their tax obligations back home,"" Fraser and De Wet said. ""The assumption that it automatically ends at the border is no longer a safe one."" Fraser and De Wet explained that several legal options are available to South African expats to protect their worldwide income from local taxes. These options apply whether the South African in question plans to leave the country temporarily or permanently. ""Understanding these options is vital to ensure compliance and mitigate your tax liability in South Africa,"" they said. One of these options is the Section 10(1)(o)(ii) foreign employment income exemption, which can provide relief for South Africans working overseas. This exemption is designed to prevent double taxation, but it comes with strict requirements, Fraser and De Wet explained. This includes the requirement that the taxpayer must spend more than 183 days outside South Africa in a 12-month period, with at least 60 of those days being continuous. Only employees qualify, and compliance with SARS conditions is essential. Independent contractors, consultants, and self-employed individuals are expressly excluded. ""If your intention is to cut ties completely, you must formally cease your South African tax residency on a permanent basis. This involves showing that you are no longer considered to be ordinarily resident for tax purposes,"" they explained. ""Once residency is ceased, you are taxed in South Africa only on South African-sourced income, such as property rentals, rather than your worldwide earnings."" South Africa's network of double taxation agreements (DTAs) with other countries may offer protection to those who do not fit neatly into the abovementioned categories. A DTA offers various mechanisms that taxpayers may rely on for relief, including temporarily ceasing tax residency. This also requires a formal application to SARS. Importantly, Fraser and De Wet pointed out that this mechanism does not require taxpayers to declare that South Africa is no longer their home. They stressed that it is key for taxpayers to ensure their affairs are properly managed. This is the case whether they rely on the foreign employment exemption, pursue formal cessation of permanent residency, or use a DTA to temporarily cease tax residency. ""Without the correct process, South Africans abroad risk remaining within the local tax net longer than expected. Protecting your wealth abroad starts at home with making an informed decision on formalising your tax residence status,"" they said.",dailyinvestor.com,2025-10-01T09:08:29Z,https://dailyinvestor.com/finance/103514/sars-is-coming-after-these-wealthy-south-africans/,2025-10-01 17:26:59.759212,-0.003921568627450966
"One thing responsible for 21,000 accidents and every driver does it | Chronicle Live","It causes more accidents than mobile phones, drug driving, fatigue or potholes Drivers are being warned about the hidden dangers of parking after new government figures revealed parked cars were involved in thousands of crashes. New Department for Transport (DfT) data obtained by the online parking marketplace, YourParkingSpace, shows 20,896 reported collisions were caused by a stationary or parked vehicle blocking drivers' vision between 2014 and 2024. The figures reveal that parked cars were linked to more accidents than drug drivers (15,647), tired drivers (13,665) and defective road surfaces (13,116) over the same period. They were also responsible for more than four times as many crashes as mobile phone use (4,247). YourParkingSpace spokesperson Larne O'Donoghue said: ""These figures highlight how dangerous parked or stationary vehicles can be when they obstruct a driver's view. Motorists need to think twice before leaving their car on the roadside - and drivers passing by should always be on the lookout."" Other vision-blocking hazards flagged by the DfT include blinding headlights, awkward road layouts, overgrown hedges, buildings, road signs, street furniture and spray from other vehicles. To avoid the risks of roadside parking, YourParkingSpace is urging drivers to book safer, off-street alternatives. The platform lets motorists pre-book spaces in car parks, on private driveways or at supermarkets, hotels and train stations. Larne added: ""By reserving a space in advance, drivers can dodge the dangers of roadside parking. It's safer, more convenient - and makes perfect sense when heading to busy areas or big events.""",Chronicle Live,2025-10-01T09:01:54Z,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/one-thing-responsible-21000-accidents-32586358,2025-10-01 17:26:59.759356,-0.2156862745098039

Review: Black artist wants to be valued for her art in 'hilarious' novel,"Shannon Gibney, The Minnesota Star Tribune ""Little Movements"" Lauren Morrow's smart, incisive and hilarious debut, is an ode to the creative process and to people everywhere who feel the pull to take a risk and try something new. I have never read a book quite like this one, about the professional choreographic world, and featuring a deeply conflicted, 30-something, sardonic, Black female protagonist. It's been awhile since I enjoyed a book so much, and found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity and truth -- the truth of the absurdity -- in the world Morrow concocts. Dare I say this is an experience many readers need, especially right now? Layla Smart has been mostly happily married to an unsuccessful white screenwriter-turned-IT-guy in Brooklyn when she receives an offer for a residency at Briar House, an exclusive (and very white) dance center in rural Vermont. Although she and her husband Eli are nervous about being apart, they agree (at least on the surface) that she has to take it. People are also reading...

As the story and Layla's residency progress, we learn Briar House is not what it presents itself to be, and neither is Eli. ""There weren't many opportunities for escape in adulthood. That had been part of the appeal of Briar House, time away from everything,"" Layla says. ""I had felt like I'd figured out a loophole when I signed the paperwork. But now -- chilled to the bone, cheeks chapped, belly full, mind bent, heart broken -- Briar House felt like a disaster."" Layla is at times ambivalent about the role of her Blackness in her art. This is a topic I rarely see explored in fiction in such a nuanced way, reflecting the complexity of institutional investment in appearing ""anti-racist,"" how funding and opportunities are often tied to a certain performance of race, and the racial anxieties and contradictions these pressures exert on Black artists. After discovering the real reason she was awarded the residency, Layla muses, ""It was time to cleanse their palate with a Black artist. Something that spoke to the current moment. Now that Briar House had reached financial stability, they needed to show they were in step with the zeitgeist."" When the board is confronted with their negligence and racism, Morrow writes that they ""had nothing real to say. Harold apologized for the way everything had unfolded...They were all disappointed, but it had been a matter of Briar House surviving or not... But we should all rest assured -- the board planned to make a donation to the ACLU on behalf of the organization."" I cracked up when I read this, recognizing the tepid convictions most institutions espouse when they find themselves in a racist corner they cannot easily get out of. I imagine every Black and brown artist has experienced some version of this at some point in their career. In the end, this short, focused novel -- by a woman who used to do public relations for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater -- asks each of us to explore the artistic visions that may have eluded us, through the clouded view of our fears and attachments. It beautifully (and amusingly) asks us to acknowledge the pitfalls the illusion of stability engenders, in order to embrace a fuller, more courageous life. ____ Little Movements By: Lauren Morrow.

Farmers rally around former Virginia Tech manager after embezzlement charge,"Catawba farmers and Virginia Tech community members said they are hurt by the resignation of Catawba Sustainability Center's manager. Adam Taylor resigned last week from his role at the 377-acre, university-owned test farm in Roanoke County, following an appearance in Roanoke County Circuit Court on Sept. 18. Taylor pleaded no contest to an embezzlement charge and was ordered to pay $1,500 in restitution. The plea was taken under advisement, with another hearing scheduled for February 2027, according to court records. In an emailed statement last week, Taylor said it was an honest mistake that he is sorry for. ""When I decided surplus metal t-posts should be used on another farm for a community apple orchard in a riparian zone honoring the legacy of a farmer who worked to preserve apple genetics of the past, I thought it was aligned with the mission of the Catawba Sustainability Center,"" Taylor said. ""Only after they were in the ground I was made aware that the decision did not align with the policies in place at Virginia Tech."" Taylor said that during his employment he raised more than $900,000 for the center and interacted with thousands of people. He said ""this mistake has brought an unbelievable amount of stress to my professional and personal life."" ""I have turned my resignation into Virginia Tech and will always look back at my nearly decade at the Center fondly,"" Taylor said. ""I believed, and still do, the work at Catawba makes a real difference, not only in this region, but beyond our borders to everyone who chooses to push boundaries in ecologically minded, land-based solutions for food and agriculture."" Stakeholder groups for the center are soon beginning discussions to seek out new leadership, according to an email from a Virginia Tech spokesperson. ""We anticipate those conversations will occur over the next several months,"" the spokesperson, Mark Owczarski, said. ""Keep in mind we have stakeholders from several colleges and units from across the university as well as stakeholders from across the greater Roanoke Valley."" Because that process is set to begin, Owczarski declined to answer questions about the university's long-term plans for the sustainability center. ""Each one of those stakeholder groups is important to the center and will need to be engaged and consulted with before the university can make good, smart, strategic decisions regarding the future of the center,"" Owczarski said. ""Virginia Tech intends to engage in that process in order to provide a sense of a future direction for the center at the appropriate time."" Farmers praise and defend Taylor Since Taylor's appearance in court, various people in the Virginia Tech and Catawba Valley farming communities contacted The Roanoke Times to express their perspectives. Catawba farmers Clyde Evely and Betty Bailey said in an email that they have followed the sustainability center for about 15 years, through several managers. ""Each in their own way has helped the Center to develop and grow but it was not until Adam Taylor arrived with his strong agricultural background and skills set that the center came into its own,"" Evely and Bailey said. ""We have found him to be an excellent steward of limited resources, which all farmers must be in order to survive."" In an email, Virginia Tech professor and forage extension specialist John Fike said ""this will be a real loss"" to both the community and Fike's own work. ""In my opinion, VT should have stuck with him and worked out a positive way to resolve,"" Fike said. ""Very frustrating, disappointing."" Cam Terry founded Garden Variety Harvests, an urban farm that operates in northwest Roanoke. He sent an email last week voicing similar frustration. ""I think the state's pursuit of this case and the eventual outcome shows a real disregard for the realities of running a farm outreach program like Catawba Sustainability Center,"" Terry said. ""It's just a sad situation all around."" In an email, Nick Tyre said he is a postgraduate student at Virginia Tech who started working with Taylor in 2024. ""When I arrived at the Catawba Sustainability Center and met Adam, I quickly knew I wanted to conduct my research there,"" Tyre said. ""In my years as both a farmer and a student, I have rarely met anyone so selfless, grounded, and deeply committed to improving the lives of farmers and protecting the natural resources we all depend on."" When Tyre's research funding was cut by federal changes this spring, he said, it was Taylor who found a way to keep him funded. ""He did more to support me than my own department was able to do,"" Tyre said, ""going far beyond what was required of him."" On Tuesday, another postgraduate student at Virginia Tech named Desiree Shelley sent an email detailing some of her family's experiences in the seven years since they met Taylor. Multiple times, she said, Taylor went out of his way to help her family on farm projects. ""On one occasion after we attended a series of forest farming workshops, Adam volunteered in his free time after hours to come to our house to help us set up our first Shiitake mushroom logs,"" Shelley said. ""Due to a child care issue, we were not able to attend this workshop so Adam offered to come by our place and show us."" Another story came from Alexis Meyer, who described in an email a ""feeling of grief knowing that we no longer have such a wonderful resource led by such a capable person."" She said events Taylor coordinated helped to form a group of like-minded small farmers in Craig County. ""The workshops, community meetings about alternative energy and other land management topics brought together a network that did not exist prior to Adam's hand in implementing them,"" Meyer said. ""For this there is an incredible gratitude that many people like us feel for Adam's role.""

Thai central bank says no unusual market moves after US government shutdown,"The Bank of Thailand (BoT) reported on Wednesday there had been no unusual movements in the country's financial markets following the US government shutdown, and it was monitoring the situation. In a statement, the BoT said businesses should manage their risks from market volatility. The US dollar sank to a one-week low against major currencies on Wednesday as the US government shutdown unsettled markets and threatened to delay key jobs data, seen as crucial for Federal Reserve (Fed) policy decisions. The shutdown commenced hours after the Senate rejected a short-term spending measure that would have kept government operations afloat through Nov 21. Senate Republican Leader John Thune said the chamber would vote again on the House-passed measure on Wednesday. The Senate is due to convene at 1400 GMT. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against six major peers, slipped 0.2%. The price action across the broader markets bore a few hallmarks of safe-haven buying, giving low-yielding currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc a bid, while US Treasuries and gold held firm. Rabobank chief currency strategist Jane Foley said it was tricky discerning if yen strength was driven by safe-haven demand or speculation about the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raising rates. ""It's a market that is not sure it's supposed to be nervous. It's not blindingly obvious that there is a very strong safe-haven bid. There are small pockets of evidence that there is."" The dollar was down 0.5% against the yen, around its weakest in two weeks, while losing around 0.2% against the Swiss franc, another traditional safe haven. US President Donald Trump warned congressional Democrats on Tuesday that letting the federal government shutdown would allow his administration to take ""irreversible"" actions including closing programmes important to them. The US Labour and Commerce departments said their statistics agencies would halt data releases in the event of a partial shutdown. That includes Friday's scheduled nonfarm payrolls release, considered key in determining whether a Fed rate cut is likely at the end of this month. On Tuesday, a mixed reading for the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, pressured the dollar. The report showed US job openings increased marginally in August while hiring declined, consistent with a softening labour market. In the absence of official data, more emphasis will fall on private-sector economic indicators. The ADP employment report is due later on Wednesday. The length of any shutdown may be key for markets, as the Fed's next policy decision on October 29 remains weeks away. Traders currently see a quarter-point cut as a near certainty, with market-implied odds of around 95%, according to LSEG data. In contrast, traders are placing a roughly 40% chance the BOJ will raise interest rates this month. The central bank's quarterly ""tankan"" corporate sentiment survey on Wednesday showed confidence among big Japanese manufacturers improved for the second straight quarter and firms maintained their upbeat spending plans. BOJ officials have tilted more hawkish in recent days, including formerly dovish board member Asahi Noguchi, who said on Monday that the need for policy tightening was increasing ""more than ever."" ""The BOJ does not actually appear especially worried about how Trump tariffs might affect the Japanese economy,"" said Yusuke Matsuo, senior markets economist at Mizuho Securities. The euro shrugged off a survey on Wednesday that showed euro zone manufacturing activity slipped back into contraction last month, with new orders falling at their fastest pace in six months. The euro, which gained 0.2% in September and is up 13.5% this year, rose 0.25% to $1.1763, around one-week highs.",Bangkok Post,2025-10-01T08:54:00Z,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3114033/thai-central-bank-says-no-unusual-market-moves-after-us-government-shutdown,2025-10-01 17:27:02.132182,-0.1764705882352942
Is Dubai strict on women's clothing? - Curious Expeditions,"Is Dubai Strict on Women's Clothing? Navigating Fashion and Expectations Dubai is not rigidly strict on women's clothing in the way some perceive. While respecting local customs is crucial, the city generally promotes tolerance and encourages modest, but not necessarily restrictive, attire in public spaces. Dubai, a dazzling metropolis renowned for its towering skyscrapers, luxury shopping, and vibrant culture, often evokes curiosity regarding its social norms, particularly concerning women's clothing. Misconceptions abound, leading to anxiety among potential tourists and expatriates. It's essential to navigate these perceptions with accurate information and a balanced perspective. While adherence to local customs is important, the reality on the ground is often more nuanced than the stereotypes suggest. The common image of Dubai as adhering to a staunchly conservative dress code for women, mandating head coverings and long, flowing garments, is largely inaccurate. While modesty is valued and expected, the enforcement of specific dress codes is generally limited to religious sites and certain government institutions. In tourist areas, shopping malls, restaurants, and public beaches, visitors will encounter a diverse range of attire. Western clothing styles are common, with many women opting for jeans, t-shirts, dresses, and skirts. The emphasis lies on respectful attire, avoiding excessively revealing clothing that might cause offense. Respecting local sensibilities is paramount for a comfortable and enjoyable experience. While not legally enforced, modesty is a cultural value ingrained in Emirati society, stemming from Islamic traditions. This translates into an expectation for both men and women to dress respectfully in public spaces. For women, this generally means avoiding overly revealing outfits, such as extremely short skirts, low-cut tops, and sheer clothing. Understanding the context of cultural sensitivity is key. While Dubai is a cosmopolitan city that embraces diversity, respecting the local customs is a sign of courtesy and appreciation. This extends beyond clothing and encompasses behavior and interactions in public spaces. Despite the overall relaxed atmosphere, specific situations warrant extra attention to dress code guidelines. These include visiting religious sites, attending formal events, and interacting with government officials. When visiting mosques or other religious sites, women are required to dress modestly, covering their heads, arms, and legs. Many mosques provide abayas (long, loose-fitting robes) and headscarves for visitors to use. Refusal to adhere to these guidelines may result in denial of entry. Government buildings and offices often maintain a stricter dress code. It is advisable to dress conservatively when conducting business or interacting with government officials. Avoiding revealing clothing and opting for modest business attire is recommended. While bikinis and swimsuits are generally acceptable at beaches and swimming pools in hotels and resorts, it is important to avoid public displays of immodesty. Walking around in swimwear outside designated areas is generally considered inappropriate. Yes, you can wear shorts in Dubai, but it's advisable to opt for longer shorts that reach the knee or just above. Very short shorts may be considered inappropriate in certain areas, especially outside of tourist zones. No, you do not need to cover your hair in Dubai, unless you are visiting a mosque or other religious site. For business meetings, professional attire is recommended. For women, this could include a pantsuit, a skirt and blouse, or a modest dress. Tank tops are generally acceptable in tourist areas, but avoid excessively revealing tank tops with very thin straps or low necklines. Yes, bikinis are acceptable at beaches and swimming pools in hotels and resorts. However, avoid walking around in swimwear outside of these designated areas. Avoid wearing clothing that is excessively revealing, such as very short skirts, low-cut tops, sheer clothing, and clothing with offensive slogans or imagery. While there are no explicit fines for wearing ""inappropriate"" clothing, you may be asked to cover up or leave a particular establishment if your attire is deemed offensive. The best way to show respect is to dress modestly, avoid public displays of affection, and be mindful of local customs and traditions. Leggings are generally acceptable if worn under a long top, skirt, or dress that covers your bottom. Pack a mix of lightweight, breathable clothing that can be easily layered. Include items such as jeans, t-shirts, dresses, skirts, and a light jacket or sweater for evenings. While ripped jeans are not strictly prohibited, it is best to avoid excessively ripped or distressed jeans that may be considered inappropriate in certain settings. Dubai offers a wide range of shopping options, from luxury boutiques to budget-friendly stores. You can find affordable modest clothing in malls, local markets, and department stores. Navigating the dress code in Dubai is about understanding the nuances of cultural expectations and embracing a respectful approach to fashion. While there are no rigid laws mandating specific attire for women, modesty is valued and appreciated. By being mindful of local customs and dressing respectfully, visitors and residents alike can enjoy all that Dubai has to offer without causing offense. The key takeaway is to prioritize respect and cultural sensitivity in your clothing choices, ensuring a positive and enriching experience in this vibrant and cosmopolitan city.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T09:04:22Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/is-dubai-strict-on-womens-clothing/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.132844,0.1843137254901961
US DOE's TRACE-Ga to fund gallium recovery from US metal processing feedstocks,"US DOE's TRACE-Ga to fund gallium recovery from US metal processing feedstocks The US Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) has announced up to $6m in federal funding available for R&D projects to help establish a secure domestic supply chain for gallium. The Technology for Recovery and Advanced Critical-material Extraction-Gallium (TRACE-Ga) initiative aims to drive innovative and cost-effective technologies for gallium recovery from US metal processing feedstocks, advancing the USA's commitment to strengthen its critical mine rals supply chain. Developing domestic supply chains for gallium should help to strengthen the USA's national security by fostering the commercialization of cutting-edge technologies, expanding the nation's critical materials portfolio, and reducing the reliance on foreign sources. The TRACE-Ga initiative is managed by ENERGYWERX through a Partnership Intermediary Agreement set up by the DOE's Office of Technology Commercialization. The agreement enables ENERGYWERX to broaden DOE's engagement with innovative organizations and non-traditional partners, facilitating the rapid development, scaling and deployment of energy solutions. Projects will test and validate prototype technologies with a goal of producing at least 50kg of pure gallium from at least one 14-day campaign of continuous operation with a real-world metal industry processing stream, such as aluminium or zinc. The objective is to validate a prototype that is capable of producing at least 1 metric ton per annum scale of gallium. Successful projects will restart domestic primary gallium recovery for the first time in almost 40 years. Applicants to the TRACE-Ga funding opportunity must qualify as a domestic entity. With a submission deadline of 20 November, eligible applicants will be asked to provide: DOE expects to make between one and three awards with a minimum of 20% cost-sharing from the awardees. Awardees are expected to be notified in early 2026.

New museum at QF's Education City to celebrate life and work of Maqbool Fida Husain,"Doha, Qatar: Qatar Foundation will launch Lawh Wa Qalam: M. F. Husain Museum, a new addition to Qatar's cultural landscape, dedicated to the life and work of one of the most influential figures in the history of modern art: Maqbool Fida Husain. The museum, which opens its doors to the public on November 28, 2025, will foster creativity and dialogue while being a space for learning and discovery, as it joins the growing number of public spaces within Qatar Foundation's Education City that celebrate and perpetuate art, heritage, and innovation. Offering a deeply immersive art experience, the museum will invite visitors to step inside the world of Maqbool Fida Husain and explore the influences, philosophies, and memories that shaped his artistic journey. Through multimedia storytelling and art forms including paintings, films, tapestry, photography, and poetry, the museum will bring Husain's creativity to life in bold and innovative ways. Chairperson of Qatar Foundation, H H Sheikha Moza bint Nasser commissioned Husain to produce a series of paintings inspired by Arab civilisation. He completed over 35 of these before his death, some of which will be among the artworks displayed in the galleries of Lawh Wa Qalam: M. F. Husain Museum. The design of the museum mirrors a sketch by Husain depicting the architectural concept he envisioned for the building, which he saw as being an artwork in itself, reflecting his lifelong pursuit of innovation and his artistic work across diverse fields. ""Designed as a space for inspiration and creativity, Lawh Wa Qalam: M. F. Husain Museum reflects Qatar Foundation's dedication to providing spaces for everyone to explore, enjoy, learn from, and be inspired by art and culture,"" said Executive Director of Community Engagement and Programming, Qatar Foundation, Kholoud M. Al-Ali. ""This immersive museum will provide a space for exploration, discovery, and critical thinking, fostering artistic dialogue and creating meaningful connections with audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

World Shares Are Mixed As A US Government Shutdown Adds To Uncertainty,"The U.S. futures sank and world shares were mixed after a U.S. government shutdown began on Wednesday. The future for the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.7%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Dow gained 0.2%, to set an all-time high. The Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher to 22,660.01. In early European trading, Germany's DAX lost 0.3% to 23,818.68 and the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% lower, to 7,890.60. Britain's FTSE rose 0.4% to 9,390.92. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.9% to 44,550.85 after the Bank of Japan reported a slight improvement in business sentiment among major manufacturers. The indications from the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey raise the odds that the central bank will increase its key interest rate to counter inflation that has topped its target range of about 2% for some time. Political uncertainty is also looming over Japan's markets, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party due to chose a new leader and prime minister later this week to replace embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Although markets and offices in mainland China are closed Oct. 1-8 for the National Day holiday, China's central bank said it plans a 1.1 trillion yuan ($160 billion) reverse repo operation on Oct. 9, to increase the amount of cash in circulation and stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,455.83, while Taiwan's Taiex added 0.6% on heavy buying of semiconductor-related shares. Markets appeared to be taking the U.S. shutdown, which took effect at midnight U.S. Eastern time, in stride. Past U.S. government shutdowns have had a limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Also Read: Who Will Produce India's 5th-Generation Stealth Fighter Jets? -Details Many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. This shutdown could be different, with the White House prone to push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs won't derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Tuesday brought mixed reports on the U.S. economy. A Conference Board survey showed consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ""low-hire, low-fire"" state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that's neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, since a government shutdown would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday's on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. The Department of Labor has said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there's a lapse. The agency already was strained by Trump's firing of Erika McEntarfer as BLS commissioner on Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed a rapid slowdown in hiring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Late Tuesday, the White House said Trump was withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the bureau, according to an AP source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a White House action that hadn't been publicly announced. Early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 40 cents at $62.77 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 41 cents to $66.44 per barrel.

Islamabad High Court allows 15-year-old girl to stay with husband,"ISLAMABAD : The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has allowed a 15-year-old girl to live with her husband, despite highlighting that marriage under the age of 18 is a crime under the Islamabad Child Marriage Restraint Act. The court also issued a series of recommendations for harmonizing Sharia principles with Pakistan's legal framework on marriage, juvenile protection, and criminal law. The case involved Madiha Bibi, who had expressed her desire not to return to her parents' home and instead live with her husband. Even during her stay at a crisis centre, the girl consistently maintained that she wished to be with her husband of her own free will. According to the court's findings, her marriage certificate (nikahnama) listed her age as approximately 18 years. However, NADRA records confirmed she was only 15 years old. In its written decision, the IHC observed that under Sharia law, marriage is considered valid once an individual has reached puberty and given consent. However, the court stressed that marriage below the age of 18 is a punishable offense under the Islamabad Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025. The judgement also referenced the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 and the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, underscoring the need for consistency across different legal instruments. The IHC issued several recommendations aimed at addressing gaps in Pakistan's legal system regarding underage marriages: To ensure compliance, the IHC directed that copies of the decision be sent to: In conclusion, the IHC emphasized the need for a legal framework that both respects religious principles and protects children's rights. The court made it clear that while Sharia recognizes marriage after puberty, the state has a responsibility to prevent child marriages through enforceable legislation and institutional safeguards.",The Frontier Post,2025-10-01T09:06:31Z,https://thefrontierpost.com/islamabad-high-court-allows-15-year-old-girl-to-stay-with-husband/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.134369,-0.02745098039215688
What cash is best for Mexico? - Curious Expeditions,"What Cash is Best for Mexico? Navigating Currency Exchange Like a Pro The Mexican Peso (MXN) is undoubtedly the best cash to use in Mexico, offering the best exchange rates and widest acceptance. While US dollars are widely accepted, understanding the nuances of currency exchange can significantly enhance your travel experience and save you money. Choosing the right currency to use while traveling in Mexico can seem daunting, but understanding the local economic context is key. While US dollars are accepted in many tourist areas, relying solely on them can lead to unfavorable exchange rates and limit your purchasing power. Embracing the Mexican Peso allows you to experience the country like a local and often secure better deals. The Mexican Peso is the official currency of Mexico, and its ubiquitous presence throughout the country makes it the most practical choice for everyday transactions. From bustling markets to quaint corner stores, using Pesos will ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience. Local vendors often offer lower prices when paying in their national currency. The US Dollar holds a certain allure due to its widespread recognition and relative stability. However, its acceptance in Mexico comes with caveats. Businesses accepting USD often apply their own exchange rates, typically less favorable than official rates. While convenient in tourist zones, relying solely on USD can result in paying a premium. The key to maximizing your spending power lies in understanding how to exchange your currency strategically. Avoiding airport exchange counters and exploring alternative options like local ATMs and banks will yield better results. Airport exchange counters often offer the least favorable exchange rates, capitalizing on travelers' urgency and convenience. It is best to avoid exchanging currency at airports whenever possible. Withdrawing Pesos from ATMs in Mexico is generally a more cost-effective approach. Be mindful of potential withdrawal fees from both your bank and the local ATM. Opt for ATMs operated by major banks, as they tend to offer better security and exchange rates. Always decline the ATM's offer to convert to your home currency, choosing to be charged in Mexican Pesos. This allows your bank to handle the conversion, usually resulting in a better rate. Visiting a local bank in Mexico can offer competitive exchange rates, particularly for larger transactions. However, be prepared for longer wait times and potentially more stringent identification requirements. This option is most suitable for those planning extended stays or needing to exchange substantial amounts of currency. While cash is essential, credit and debit cards offer convenience and security, especially for larger purchases and emergencies. However, be aware of potential foreign transaction fees and inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid card blocks. Choose cards with no foreign transaction fees to maximize savings. Mexico is experiencing a surge in digital payments, making platforms like Mercado Pago and QR code-based transactions increasingly common. While not as ubiquitous as cash, understanding these emerging payment methods can offer added convenience in certain situations. Keep an eye on developing trends and potential adoption by local businesses. The optimal approach is a combination of cash and cards. Carry enough Pesos for everyday expenses and smaller vendors, while using cards for larger purchases and situations where security is a concern. This balanced approach ensures flexibility and minimizes potential risks. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you navigate the currency landscape in Mexico with confidence: It is generally not recommended to exchange large sums of money before leaving for Mexico. Airport exchange rates at your departure location are typically unfavorable. However, carrying a small amount of Pesos for initial expenses, such as airport transportation, can be helpful. Exchange rates fluctuate constantly based on market conditions. You can find current exchange rates on reputable financial websites like Bloomberg, XE.com, or Google Finance. However, remember that actual exchange rates offered by banks, ATMs, and businesses may vary. Traveler's checks are becoming increasingly obsolete and are not widely accepted in Mexico. Cashing them can be difficult and time-consuming. It's best to rely on cash and credit/debit cards. Using ATMs operated by major banks in well-lit and secure locations is generally safe. Be aware of your surroundings and cover the keypad when entering your PIN. It's also wise to use ATMs inside banks rather than standalone machines on the street. Be wary of street vendors offering exchange services, as they may engage in scams like providing counterfeit bills or manipulating exchange rates. Always use reputable banks or ATMs for your currency exchange needs. Also, double-check your change. While tipping in US dollars is acceptable, tipping in Mexican Pesos is preferred. It shows respect for local customs and ensures that the recipient doesn't have to deal with the hassle of exchanging the currency themselves. The amount of cash you need to carry depends on your spending habits and the type of activities you plan to engage in. As a general guideline, carrying the equivalent of $50-$100 USD in Pesos per day should suffice for most travelers, excluding larger purchases like hotel bills. You can exchange leftover Pesos back to your home currency at a bank or currency exchange counter. Alternatively, you can keep them for future trips to Mexico or use them to pay for goods and services at duty-free shops in Mexican airports. There are no specific Peso denominations to avoid. However, carrying a mix of smaller bills (20, 50, and 100 Pesos) is helpful for tipping and making small purchases. Larger denominations (200, 500, and 1000 Pesos) are suitable for larger transactions. Mexican Peso bills have several security features, including raised print, watermarks, and security threads. You can also compare the bill to a known genuine bill. If in doubt, refuse to accept the bill. Credit cards are widely accepted in major cities and tourist areas, particularly in hotels, restaurants, and large stores. However, smaller establishments and local markets may prefer cash. Always check with the vendor beforehand to confirm whether they accept credit cards. Several mobile apps can assist with currency conversion and tracking expenses while traveling in Mexico. Popular options include XE Currency Converter, Revolut, and Wise. These apps can help you stay informed about current exchange rates and manage your travel budget effectively. Remember to be aware of data roaming charges if you are not using local Wifi.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T08:58:44Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/what-cash-is-best-for-mexico/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.135170,0.3647058823529412

China's ride-hailing companies try to quell the smell in cars where some drivers sleep,"BEIJING -- You're on the move in China's capital. You've just booked a ride through a ride-hailing app and, in no time, it seems, a sleek new electric vehicle pulls up to whisk you away. Sometimes, though, not everything goes so well. Occasionally, once inside the car, a rank or funky odor assails your nostrils. After your ride, as you rate your driver, your app asks you: ""Was the car smelly?"" You click yes, and a broken heart emoji appears. ""Most taxi drivers whose cars smell bad actually live in their cars,"" explains 36-year-old driver, Shao Wei. ""I can understand them. They just want to save some money to help their families live a little better."" The smell of economic hardship is in part the result of millions of Chinese being thrown out of work by the coronavirus pandemic and China's slowing economy. Many have piled into the ride-hailing business and the wider gig economy. In 2018, Shao Wei, then 28, quit his financial sector job to return to his hometown in northeastern China, to get married, buy a home and settle down. But his business failed, he went into debt and his marriage ended in divorce. He returned to Beijing last year to drive a ride-hailing car. With no family to support, he's able to save half his earnings, and he's given himself 600 days to pay off his debt. Like many drivers, he has to work up to 15 hours a day just to get enough fares. He doesn't live in his car, which he rents and cleans daily to avoid odors. But he sympathizes with colleagues who are less fortunate. ""I think the drivers whose cars smell bad are heroes who bravely face life,"" he says, ""and I hope passengers will give them some understanding."" But Chinese consumers are increasingly demanding a more pleasant experience -- and that includes cleanliness -- for their money. In response to riders' complaints, China's biggest ride-hailing company, DiDi Chuxing, put a new policy in place last year. If drivers get too much negative feedback about their car's smell, DiDi may temporarily suspend them, until they're trained to keep their cars clean. Forty-seven-year-old driver Yang Guangdong has been driving a ride-hailing car for a decade. He doesn't sleep in his car, but he has received some odor complaints, which he says are often unfair and subjective. His advice to colleagues: Forget about using car air fresheners and perfumes, because they may backfire. ""For example, let's say you like the smell of apples, and your passenger likes jasmine,"" he says. ""You don't like each other's scents, in which case, he's sure to say your car stinks."" Beyond that, some critics say this system of ranking rides' rankness misses the point. ""I'm not sure this measure will solve the problem, except adding more surveillance on the workers,"" says University of Toronto associate professor Julie Yujie Chen, who researches labor and technology. ""I feel it's more for public relations, to kind of like appease the passengers,"" she says. China's gig economy is dominated by digital platforms, such as ride-hailing giant DiDi Chuxing, and food delivery firm Meituan. Their ""super-apps"" provide an array of services and functions, from retail sales to travel bookings to financial services. While these platforms increasingly use customer ratings, big data and algorithms to try to improve the services their employees provide, Chen argues, ""the most fundamental issues here are related to overworking drivers, and so I don't think this can be fixed by platforms alone."" Chen also notes that the platforms are publicly listed firms, and are often under pressure to please shareholders. And their business model, she says, involves taking a cut of transactions they facilitate, all of which result in their tendency to squeeze labor costs. China's central and local governments try to regulate the ride-hailing industry, sometimes encouraging laid-off workers to join it, at other times, stopping issuing new licenses to control the oversupply of drivers. But Chen says enforcement of the government's rules has often been inconsistent and lax. China's overall economic situation has added to ride-hailing service drivers' woes. The earnings report for DiDi Global Inc., the app's parent company, says that its number of registered car owners, who either drive themselves or lease them to other drivers, increased by more than 20% last year to nearly 19 million. But with economic growth slowing, consumers are taking fewer trips, and order volume last year shrank by 8%. That leaves many DiDi drivers not unemployed, but underemployed -- struggling to make ends meet and spending a lot of time waiting for fares. None of this deters the enterprising and gregarious driver Shao Wei. He says he's glad to have a job, and doesn't like to complain. He adds that, just as riders need to be tolerant of drivers who live in their cars, drivers need to put up with riders, many of whom climb aboard not exactly smelling like roses. ""Sometimes on the late shift, I meet riders who have just eaten, or have bad breath. And they're very willing to communicate with me,"" Shao says. But, he adds, it can make a long journey pass quickly, when driver and rider are shooting the breeze.

US flood insurance program expires | Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"Authorization for the largest residential flood insurance program in the U.S. expired Tuesday, leaving homeowners unable to access new coverage and potentially wreaking havoc on home sales in flood-prone areas. Millions of policyholders rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to secure flood coverage that is rarely part of standard homeowners policies and is required for mortgages in areas deemed high-risk. Without passage of a spending bill, the NFIP, like much of the federal government, will freeze. Claims could still be paid, but with two months left in the Atlantic hurricane season and winter weather on its way, homeowners and renters would be unable to buy, renew or add to policies. That would also thwart real estate transactions where mortgages require flood insurance. Lenders are prohibited from issuing government-backed mortgages for properties in Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated ""special flood hazard areas "" unless the building or mobile home is covered by flood insurance. Since private insurance does not offer flood coverage in many parts of the U.S., buyers often depend on the National Flood Insurance Program. ""Each day a shutdown continues, the effects on the housing sector grow,"" said Shannon McGahn, executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at the National Association of Realtors. The program supports nearly half a million home sales annually, according to the Realtors group. Past lapses have shown the potential impact on the market: During a roughly 30-day freeze in June 2010, the National Association of Realtors estimated 1,400 home sales were canceled or delayed each day. The problem would be most acutely felt in Florida where about 14,800 monthly home sale closings depend on securing flood insurance. Texas, with 3,500 monthly closings, would also be affected. Flood insurance access is ""just one of the many ways the extended shutdown could worsen the outlook for the housing market across the country,"" said Francis Torres, associate director for housing and infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, citing housing vouchers and FHA-backed loans for first-time homebuyers as other areas that could be undermined by limited funds and staff. ""There is a direct through-line between a protracted shutdown and worsening conditions for the nation's housing crisis,"" Torres said. Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program through the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. It was meant to improve flood insurance access and affordability but also to set floodplain management standards. ""It's not just an insurance program, and that's probably the most misunderstood aspect,"" said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. The over 22,500 communities participating in the program must adopt minimum standards to access the program. They can also apply for mitigation funding to reduce risk ahead of time. The FEMA-managed program has over 4.7 million policies representing $1.3 trillion in coverage. The National Flood Insurance Program's last long-term reauthorization was in 2012. Since the end of 2017, its continuation has depended on 33 short-term reauthorizations. Lawmakers, industry groups and policyholders have long called for reform to give the program stability and to address issues with floodplain mapping, affordability and solvency. Floods are the ""most common and widespread"" type of disaster in the U.S., according the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, occurring in every state and territory and putting pressure on the insurance system. But only about 4% of homeowners had flood coverage as of November 2024, according to the Government Accountability Office. The GAO has cautioned that FEMA maps ""may not reflect current flood risks,"" and Berginnis said the agency has a long way to go in mapping flood zones: ""We've only mapped about a third of the nation's floodplains, and we wonder why flood losses keep going up,"" he said. The National Flood Insurance Program has also struggled to set premium prices that balance affordability with solvency. The program borrows from the U.S. Treasury when it cannot payout claims and currently owes almost $23 billion. A group of House lawmakers introduced a bill last week to reauthorize the program until Nov. 21. But Congress must look at a longer term solution, said Amanda Devecka-Rinear, executive director of the disaster-survivor advocacy group New Jersey Organizing Project. ""It's not fair to storm survivors and their communities to have this unpredictability and instability,"" she said.",Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2025/oct/01/us-flood-insurance-program-expires/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.137413,0.05098039215686279
UPI Transactions Free From Charges: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra Says Central Bank Has No Proposal To Impose Fees | 📲 LatestLY,"New Delhi, October 1: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday reiterated that the central bank has no proposal to impose a fee on transactions done through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The governor's clarification came during his address after the post-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Malhotra stated that he had never said UPI could stay free forever, but he noted that someone needs to bear the costs associated with its functioning. ""What I said was there are costs associated with UPI transactions, and the same need to be paid for by someone,"" the governor said. The governor had clarified the same during the previous post-policy conferences. Earlier in the morning, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data showed that the UPI saw 31 per cent transaction count growth (year-on-year) at 19.63 billion in September. UPI Transaction Witness 31% YoY Growth in September 2025 at 19.63 Billion: NPCI. The transaction amount also rose 21 per cent to Rs 24.90 lakh crore.

Tala Expands In Latin America,"Since its launch in 2014, Tala has delivered over $7 billion in credit to more than 12 million customers across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and East Africa. Global financial infrastructure company Tala has announced its expansion into Latin America, beginning with a launch in Guatemala, with plans to enter the Dominican Republic and Panama by the end of 2025. The company says the move will leverage its proprietary ""Tala in a Box"" technology, enabling rapid geographic growth by combining credit intelligence, payments execution, and relationship expertise. While most adults in Latin America have access to basic financial products, many still lack essential services such as credit. Tala says its integrated model is designed to bridge that gap by scaling responsible financial access. Since its launch in 2014, Tala has delivered over $7 billion in credit to more than 12 million customers across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and East Africa through its flagship credit app. In East Africa, Tala remains a major player in the digital lending space, extending access to underserved communities who often fall outside the reach of traditional banking. Tala says it has already served nearly four million customers in Mexico, where it has issued 20 million loans over the past eight years, making it its fastest-growing market. In East Africa, particularly Kenya, the company's mobile-first lending model has introduced millions to the formal financial system, often providing their first-ever digital credit. ""Through our experience serving the Mexican market, we have developed deep insights in the region and found that existing services still don't serve the majority of the population,"" said Annstella Mumbi, General Manager, Tala, Kenya. ""We have the technology and products to change that."" Tala says its growth is being fueled by proprietary innovations such as Tala InSight, a patent-pending AI model that helps create financial identities for users, and a full-stack financial supply chain that includes transfers, payments, and rails abstraction services. The company is building on a three-year revenue CAGR of 35 per cent, supported by over $500 million in equity and debt funding from global investors. The new expansion, Tala says, represents a fresh phase of growth driven by its decade-long experience in building digital credit infrastructure across three continents.",CIO Africa,2025-10-01T08:57:32Z,https://cioafrica.co/tala-expands-in-latin-america/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.137945,0.2549019607843137

"ASEAN's ""Mini Silicon Valley"" Boom, Why Singapore is Becoming Magnet for Tech Startups - Thailand Business News","Singapore is cementing its status as Southeast Asia's leading technology hub, attracting global investors and entrepreneurs eager to tap into the region's fast-growing digital economy. Singapore's strategic location, robust infrastructure, and business-friendly policies have made it a magnet for innovation. The city-state is home to cutting-edge research facilities, thriving startup ecosystems, and a highly skilled workforce, positioning it as a gateway to the broader ASEAN market. Branded by some as ASEAN's ""Mini Silicon Valley,"" the city-state has become a launchpad for startups thanks to deep pools of capital, a supportive government, and unrivalled access to neighboring markets. Southeast Asia's 680 million consumers, many of them young and mobile-first, represent one of the world's most dynamic growth opportunities. Analysts say Singapore has positioned itself as the most effective gateway to this market. Favorable regulation, strong intellectual property laws, and pro-innovation policies by agencies such as the Economic Development Board and Infocomm Media Development Authority make it an attractive entry point for foreign founders. Regional investment in research and development has also surged, rising from about US$10.6 billion in 2002 to nearly US$55 billion in 2023, with Singapore playing a leading role in commercialising innovation. Venture capital flows further underscore the city-state's dominance. Startups based in Singapore raised around 62 percent of all Southeast Asian funding in the first nine months of 2024, roughly US$2.3 billion. By early 2025, that share had climbed to an extraordinary 95 percent, reflecting investor preference for the city's stable ecosystem. Even as global markets remain cautious, Enterprise Singapore reports that deep-tech ventures, alongside fintech, artificial intelligence and health technology, continue to attract strong interest. The city-state's rise reflects broader shifts across Asia. McKinsey research projects that by 2040, the region could account for 42 percent of global GDP and nearly 60 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies. Artificial intelligence and digital services are at the heart of this transformation, with investment in AI across Asia expected to reach US$110 billion by 2028. As Asia assumes a more prominent role in global innovation, Singapore is emerging as a trusted connector linking multinational capital, regional talent and a fast-growing consumer base. The path forward is not without challenges. Startup funding remains cyclical, with early-stage deals vulnerable to investor pullbacks. Competition for highly skilled talent is intensifying, particularly in deep tech and AI. Geopolitical tensions and tighter global credit conditions could also weigh on expansion plans. Yet analysts argue that Singapore's fundamentals remain strong. With a pro-business government, a robust legal framework and a reputation as a safe and reliable hub, the city-state is well placed to entrench its role as ASEAN's innovation capital, and potentially one of the world's most important startup ecosystems.",Thailand Business News,2025-10-01T09:00:28Z,https://www.thailand-business-news.com/startups/248957-aseans-mini-silicon-valley-boom-why-singapore-is-becoming-magnet-for-tech-startups,2025-10-01 17:27:02.138501,0.4901960784313726
"Pesalink, Cellulant Partner To Ease Bank To Business Payments","L-R: Plounne Oyunge, Chief Growth Officer at Pesalink and Michael Muriuki, VP Group Innovation and Software Engineering at Cellulant. Integrated Payment Services Limited (IPSL), operators of Pesalink and Cellulant have expanded their partnership to simplify and scale customer-to-business (C2B) payments for online in Kenya. The goal of the partnership is to reduce delays, cut down on errors, and give both businesses and customers a more reliable way to handle digital payments. The integration of Cellulant's robust payment platform, Tingg, platform with Pesalink's real-time bank network is aimed at solving practical issues many businesses face especially with reconciling payments and handling high-value transactions. At the same time, it gives customers more flexibility and control when paying online. The partnership connects over 80 financial institutions in Kenya, including 39 commercial banks, SACCOs, and fintech companies. According to the two companies, it's meant to strengthen the infrastructure that supports bank-to-merchant payments in the country. Instead of switching between cards and mobile money apps, customers can now pay directly from their bank account up to USD 7737 (Kes 999,999) per transaction with the option to confirm payment details before sending. This reduces errors, builds trust, and makes digital payments more dependable. With the rollout of the partnership, every payment, comes with a clear reference number, so both the customer and the business can easily track and confirm what the payment was for. It's a small detail, but one that helps reduce disputes and confusion. The service has gone live with businesses in the airline and travel sectors and will be rolled out more widely over the next few months. ""Pesalink was built to simplify life through instant, affordable payments for everyone, everywhere, every time. Our partnership with Cellulant directly addresses recurring merchant pain points in payment reconciliation, while providing customers with a seamless experience,"" said Plounne Oyunge, Chief Growth Officer at Pesalink. ""We believe this will be a catalyst for growth in Kenya's digital economy, and we are showing how payments can truly move differently."" She adds For companies that rely on larger or more frequent transactions like those in travel or aviation bank payments are often preferred, but they come with their own set of issues. Late settlements, unclear payment references, and delays in reconciliation are common. This integration is aimed at addressing that. Cellulant operates Tingg, its single API payment platform, which supports over 200 payment methods, including cards, bank transfers, and mobile money, across both online and offline channels, simplifying accepting and making payments. Tingg today processes more than 4.5 million transactions daily, powering payments for local, regional, and global businesses across Africa. ""At Cellulant, we believe that transforming how money moves transforms lives. Every time we remove friction from the movement of money, we enable businesses to grow faster, consumers to access more opportunities, and communities to thrive,"" said Michael Muriuki, VP Group Innovation and Software Engineering at Cellulant. ""Seamless and secure payments are a tool for progress: they build trust, drive commerce, and open doors to innovation. This partnership with Pesalink demonstrates our commitment to improving the everyday transaction experience for businesses and the customers they serve."" The collaboration comes at a time when Kenya's digital payments sector is expanding rapidly. The market is expected to reach USD 9.36 billion this year, with mobile money accounting for USD 5.85 billion. Pesalink alone processes over USD 31 Million daily, and over USD 852 Million per month, with 41 percent year-on-year growth.",CIO Africa,2025-10-01T08:53:20Z,https://cioafrica.co/pesalink-cellulant-partner-to-ease-bank-to-business-payments/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.138911,0.2
FM to launch on Oct 4 nationwide awareness campaign on unclaimed financial assets - The Statesman,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will launch from Gandhinagar on October 4 a three-month nationwide awareness campaign (October-December) on unclaimed assets in the financial sector, titled ""Aapki Poonji, Aapka Adhikaar (Your Money, Your Right)"". The campaign is being launched by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) in the Ministry of Finance in coordination with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA). Unclaimed financial assets, including insurance policy claims, bank deposits, dividends, shares, and mutual fund proceeds, often remain unclaimed due to a lack of awareness or outdated account details. During the campaign, the citizens will be provided with on-the-spot guidance on how to search for their unclaimed assets, update records, and complete claim procedures. Digital tools and step-by-step demonstrations will also be showcased.

Stripe Eyes National Trust Charter Amid Stablecoin Push - FinanceFeeds,"Stripe is preparing to apply for a national trust charter with U.S. regulators as part of a broader expansion into stablecoin services, according to reports from industry outlets. The application, expected to be filed through its crypto-focused subsidiary Bridge, would allow Stripe to align with anticipated federal oversight of digital dollar tokens and position itself as a leader in regulated stablecoin payments. The planned charter application signals Stripe's intention to work under direct supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the primary regulator for national banks. A national trust charter would enable Bridge to provide custody and settlement for digital assets, while granting Stripe the ability to operate under a single, uniform framework across the United States. For merchants and institutional clients, this could mean greater confidence in using Stripe's infrastructure for digital asset transactions. The move comes at a time when U.S. lawmakers are finalizing legislation aimed at establishing a formal regulatory structure for stablecoins. Draft bills moving through Congress propose that stablecoin issuers and intermediaries must hold federal banking charters or equivalent authorization. Stripe's decision to pursue a trust charter suggests the company is preparing for these upcoming requirements rather than waiting to react once new laws take effect. Bridge co-founder Jess Turner confirmed the company's intent to apply, noting that stablecoin markets will require strong federal oversight to grow sustainably. The announcement follows Stripe's recent rollout of new products tied to stablecoin payments, further underscoring its ambitions to become a dominant player in the digital asset ecosystem. By aligning early with regulators, Stripe could position itself as the compliance-ready partner of choice for businesses looking to integrate stablecoin payments. Industry analysts suggest Stripe's pursuit of a national trust charter may put competitive pressure on other major payment providers and fintech firms. While crypto-native companies such as Anchorage and Paxos have already secured trust charters, Stripe would be among the largest global payment platforms to take this regulatory step. That scale could accelerate institutional adoption of stablecoins and push the broader industry toward higher compliance standards. For Stripe, a trust charter could unlock the ability to offer dollar-backed stablecoin services at scale and integrate them directly into its existing merchant payment rails. This would give the company a strategic advantage as stablecoins gain traction as a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional cross-border settlement methods. The move could also enhance Stripe's credibility with U.S. regulators, policymakers, and corporate clients, many of whom have expressed concerns about the risks of unregulated stablecoin operators. The formal filing with the OCC has not yet been submitted, and the approval process could extend over several months. If granted, the charter would represent a milestone in Stripe's evolution from a payments processor into a regulated digital asset service provider. It would also mark a key moment in the ongoing convergence of mainstream finance and blockchain technology. As regulatory clarity around stablecoins emerges, Stripe's proactive pursuit of a national trust charter underscores its bet that compliance will be central to the future of digital payments. The decision could position Stripe not only as a payment giant, but also as a pioneer in shaping the stablecoin market for businesses, merchants, and consumers worldwide.",FinanceFeeds,2025-10-01T09:04:57Z,https://financefeeds.com/stripe-eyes-national-trust-charter-amid-stablecoin-push/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.139784,0.3568627450980393

Pakistan's textile sector faces mounting challenges despite reduced Indian presence in US market - Profit by Pakistan Today,"High production costs, tariff issues, and flood damage hamper textile exporters' ability to capitalize on India's declining market share in the US Pakistan's textile sector is grappling with significant obstacles, preventing it from capitalizing on the reduced Indian presence in the US market. Despite expectations of increased market share due to tariffs on Indian textiles, rising production costs, declining cotton quality, and policy changes have hindered the sector's growth, according to a news report. Key issues include high tariffs on Pakistani textile exports, flood damage to cotton crops, and changes to the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). The US has imposed a 29% effective tariff on Pakistani textiles, which includes a 19% additional tariff and a 10% base tariff, making Pakistani products less competitive compared to regional competitors like China and Vietnam. Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, questioned the viability of competing in the US market amid escalating costs. ""How can we compete when production costs are so high that selling in the US market becomes unviable?"" he remarked. Adding to the challenges, floods have severely impacted cotton crops, resulting in a decline in both the quantity and quality of the crop. Pakistan's cotton output is expected to fall to five million bales this year, exacerbated by continuing flood impacts. While the government has yet to complete a full damage assessment, exporters stress that the quality of cotton is a more critical concern than production levels. Moreover, outdated agricultural practices and poor seed quality have contributed to a drop in cotton quality, further complicating efforts to produce yarn and textiles that meet export standards. Experts argue that improving cotton quality through research and seed innovation is essential for the sustainability of the textile sector. Recent amendments to the EFS have compounded the situation. Previously, the scheme allowed for duty- and tax-free imports of raw materials for export production. However, the new rules exclude cotton, yarn, and grey cloth from zero-rating, forcing exporters to pay taxes upfront. This change strains liquidity and increases production costs, making exports even less competitive.",Profit by Pakistan Today,2025-10-01T09:06:08Z,https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/10/01/pakistans-textile-sector-faces-mounting-challenges-despite-reduced-indian-presence-in-us-market/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.141093,-0.04313725490196074
What are the different types of cabins on a ferry? - Curious Expeditions,"Ferry cabins range from simple, budget-friendly options to luxurious suites offering expansive views and exclusive amenities. Understanding the spectrum of cabin types available allows passengers to select the accommodation that best suits their needs, budget, and travel style, ensuring a more comfortable and enjoyable voyage. The specific types of cabins available on a ferry depend on factors like the route (international or domestic), the size of the vessel, and the operator. However, some common categories exist across different ferry lines. These categories represent a general hierarchy of comfort and price. Inside cabins are the most economical option, offering a private space without a window. They are typically located in the interior of the ferry. Outside cabins, also known as ocean view cabins, boast a window offering natural light and sea views. This feature significantly enhances the comfort and ambiance of the cabin. Deluxe cabins represent a step up in terms of space, amenities, and comfort. They often include extra features aimed at enhancing the passenger experience. Suites are the most luxurious accommodations available on a ferry, offering ample space, premium amenities, and often personalized service. Ferry operators are increasingly committed to providing accessible accommodations for passengers with disabilities. These cabins are designed to meet specific needs and ensure a comfortable and safe journey. Generally, cabin assignments are made during the booking process. However, some ferry operators may only guarantee a cabin type (e.g., inside cabin) and assign the specific cabin number at check-in. Always confirm this policy with the operator beforehand. ""Port side"" refers to the left side of the ferry when facing forward, while ""starboard side"" refers to the right side. The choice between these sides depends on personal preference. Some travelers prefer one side over the other based on the route and anticipated views. The vast majority of cabins on ferries, especially on longer routes, do have private bathrooms that include a toilet, sink, and shower. However, budget options, particularly on shorter routes, may offer shared bathroom facilities. Always verify this detail before booking. While not always guaranteed, some ferry operators allow you to select your specific cabin number for an additional fee or as a benefit of a higher fare class. Contact the ferry operator directly to inquire about this possibility. Pet policies vary significantly between ferry operators. Some allow pets in designated pet-friendly cabins, while others require pets to be kept in carriers or kennels located in a separate area of the ferry. Always check the operator's pet policy before traveling. A cabin with a ""double bed"" features one bed designed to accommodate two adults. A cabin with ""twin beds"" features two separate single beds. Some cabins may offer the option to convert twin beds into a double bed. Yes, linens and towels are typically provided in all cabin types. However, it is always a good idea to confirm this with the ferry operator, particularly for budget accommodations. Most cabins on modern ferries, especially on longer routes and in warmer climates, are equipped with air conditioning. However, this may not be the case for older ferries or cabins on shorter, regional routes. Some ferry operators offer day cabins, which can be booked for daytime use only, providing a private space to relax during the voyage without requiring an overnight stay. Availability and pricing vary. While bringing snacks and non-alcoholic beverages is generally permitted, restrictions may apply to alcohol. Many ferry operators prohibit bringing outside alcohol onboard and may require passengers to purchase alcoholic beverages from the onboard bar or restaurant. The check-in process typically involves presenting your booking confirmation and identification at the ferry terminal. Cabin keys are usually distributed at check-in or shortly after boarding. Check-out procedures are generally straightforward, requiring passengers to simply vacate the cabin before arrival at the destination port. Specific timings are often announced onboard. In the event of a significant ferry delay, the ferry operator will typically provide updates and assistance to passengers with cabin bookings. This may include offering complimentary meals, alternative accommodation if necessary, or refunds for unused cabin time. Always check the operator's policies regarding delays and cancellations.",Curious Expeditions,2025-10-01T08:55:16Z,https://curiousexpeditions.org/what-are-the-different-types-of-cabins-on-a-ferry/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.141586,0.2862745098039217

Ambac buys ArmadaCare for $250m to expand specialty insurance platform,"Ambac Financial Group, a New York-based insurance holding company, has announced a definitive agreement to acquire ArmadaCare from SiriusPoint, in a deal valued at $250m. The transaction forms a key part of Ambac's strategy to expand its specialty insurance platform and diversify its product portfolio, according to InsurTech Insights. The company said the acquisition will materially accelerate the growth and scale of its distribution platform, enhance product diversification, and broaden relationships with distribution and capacity partners. Founded to provide innovative workplace benefit products, ArmadaCare develops supplemental health and employee insurance solutions designed to complement primary healthcare plans. Its offerings are tailored to employers seeking to enhance staff benefits and strengthen talent retention. Ambac, meanwhile, operates a diversified mix of specialty underwriting and distribution businesses across the United States and the United Kingdom. Ambac said the acquisition will strengthen its position in the attractive Accident and Health sector. It also highlighted ArmadaCare's differentiated model, which includes white-glove service and regulatory expertise, as a sustainable competitive advantage. ArmadaCare will continue to be led by CEO Ed Walker and his management team following the close of the transaction. The deal is expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand and newly issued debt. Financing includes a $120m commitment from Truist Bank, made up of a $100m Term Loan A and a $20m revolving credit facility. Ambac expects the acquisition to become accretive to shareholders by 2026, support progress toward its 2028 EBITDA targets, and deliver revenue synergies. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. Truist Securities, UBS, and BMS Capital Solutions acted as financial advisors to Ambac, with Norton Rose Fulbright as legal counsel. SiriusPoint was advised by Jefferies LLC and Paul Hastings LLP. Ambac also plans to discuss the transaction and its broader strategic priorities on a conference call and webcast scheduled for 30 September 2025. Ambac president and chief executive officer Claude LeBlanc said, ""The addition of ArmadaCare materially accelerates the growth and scale of our distribution platform, strengthens specialty product diversification, and expands relationships with distribution and capacity partners. Led by CEO Ed Walker, the ArmadaCare team has a proven track record of building a successful business with exceptional leadership and a clear vision of how to compete and succeed in their niche market. We are pleased to welcome them to the Ambac family as a highly valuable addition to our platform."" ArmadaCare chief executive officer Ed Walker said, ""We could not be more excited to join the Ambac family of MGAs. Ambac's commitment to empowering their MGAs, coupled with our deep relationships with long-term underwriting partners, will fuel the continued growth and future success of our business and further establish our position as a leading health insurance solutions provider."" SiriusPoint chief executive officer Scott Egan said, ""We are delighted to continue our long-term capacity agreement with Armada and look forward to the team continuing to drive strong underwriting performance for our Accident and Health segment. We wish the team well for an exciting new chapter under the ownership of Ambac.""",FinTech Global,2025-10-01T08:55:42Z,https://fintech.global/2025/10/01/ambac-buys-armadacare-for-250m-to-expand-specialty-insurance-platform/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.142390,0.4509803921568627

BYD Denza B5 and Denza B8 SUVs confirmed for Australia,"The first two models to arrive in Australia from BYD's luxury sister brand Denza have been locked in for a November launch. BYD Australia has announced the Denza B5 and Denza B8 plug-in hybrid (PHEV) large SUVs will be the first two models to be released by its Denza sister brand here, confirming a November 2025 local launch for the new Chinese luxury brand. The five-seat Denza B5 is similar in size to the Toyota Prado and GWM Tank 300, while the seven-seat B8 is a larger three-row SUV designed to take on the likes of the Toyota LandCruiser 300 Series and Nissan Patrol. Pricing and equipment levels for the two new models are yet to be announced, as are any official details of Denza's Australian dealer network. The Denza B5, essentially an SUV version of the BYD Shark 6 PHEV dual-cab ute already in local showrooms, is priced between ¥239,800 and ¥302,800 in China, which equates to approximately A$50,950-$64,340. The Denza B8 is priced between ¥379,800 and ¥407,800 in China, or approximately $A80,700-$A86,650. A right-hand drive B8 was previously spotted undergoing testing on Australian roads, and CarExpert tested both the B8 and the B5 earlier this year in China. Denza is a sister brand of Chinese auto giant BYD, offering premium rather than mainstream models and echoing the relationship between Lexus and Toyota. In a statement, BYD said it will offer ""a curated range of premium vehicles from BYD's three acclaimed sub-brands - reimagined under the Denza name"". That means models sold overseas under the Fangchengbao, YangWang and Denza brands will sold under the Denza name here. The two new models are sold in China as the Fangchengbao Bao 5 and Fangchengbao Bao 8, which translates to 'Formula Leopard', but they will ditch the Fangchengbao branding in favour of Denza badges in Australia. The B5 and B8 are both based on a rugged ladder-frame chassis and employ BYD's 'DMO' platform, which refer to their PHEV powertrain technology. The Denza B5 sits on a 2800mm wheelbase, measures 4890mm long, 1970mm wide and 1920mm high, and features adjustable 'Disus-P' adjustable air suspension offering up to 310mm of ground clearance. Power comes from a 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine and a pair of electric motors - one on each axle - to deliver a combined output of 505kW of power and 760Nm of torque, and a claimed 0-100km/h time of 4.8 seconds. Total claimed range of 1020km (WLTP) includes 100km of electric-only driving, thanks to a 31.8kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack, while in Chinese-market versions the cabin mirrors that of the BYD Shark 6 launched in Australia earlier this year. The larger B8, meantime, delivers 550kW/760Nm outputs from its 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine and twin electric motors, and also offers 100km of EV-only driving as part of its claimed total range of 984km (WLTP). BYD claims the B8 offers the same 0-100km/h time of 4.8 seconds as the B5, despite the fact it sits on a longer 2920mm wheelbase and has a longer overall length of 5195mm. In comparison, the LandCruiser 300 Series has a 2850mm wheelbase and is 4965mm long. It also features BYD's adjustable 'DiSus-P' air suspension system, offering ground clearance of between 220mm and 310mm, and has a maximum water fording depth of 890mm. Driving modes include Snow, Mud, Sand, Wading, Mountain, Burst and Sport+, while the interior of the B8 we tested in China had swathes of leather on the doors, dash, seats and steering wheel, plus a massive 17.3-inch central touchscreen. The flagship B8 was also fitted with BYD's 'God's Eye' advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), which uses cameras, radars, LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors to offer functions including adaptive cruise control and BYD's Navigate on Autopilot system. As well as the B8 and B5 off-road SUVs, Denza is also tipped to bring the Z9 GT sports car - which features Porsche Panamera-like styling - as well as its D9 electric people-mover and N9 electric SUV to Australia.",7NEWS.com.au,2025-10-01T09:05:32Z,https://7news.com.au/motoring/byd-denza-b5-and-denza-b8-suvs-confirmed-for-australia-c-20204831,2025-10-01 17:27:02.142953,0.04313725490196085
Bitcoin (BTC) Nears Key Breakout Level: Price Analysis and Predictions,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price has turned back up on Wednesday and is a very short distance from a key breakout level that would likely take the king of the cryptocurrencies back to the all-time high if it can be broken and held above. Can Bitcoin put on a spurt and break this level, or will relatively overbought conditions lead to a rejection? The above 8-hour chart shows the $BTC price returning to the top of a parallel channel. The fact that horizontal resistance converges with the top of the channel means that this level is going to be a difficult one to break. It must be noted that this level has become the most important zone for the bulls, given that a breakthrough here would likely lead back to the all-time high, with only the $117,400, and the $120,000 horizontal levels providing any kind of resistance. Just taking into account the measured move for the channel breakout would push the price up above $129,000. The daily chart reveals that the $BTC price is holding above the 50-day SMA. This means that buyers are defending the intermediate trend. As long as this remains the case, this is a bullish occurrence. That said, if this 50-day SMA is dropped and confirmed below, this could lead to the price falling back down, perhaps all the way to the bottom of the channel. The Stochastic RSI indicators are climbing in this time frame, and the RSI indicator has already crossed up above the yellow moving average line. If it can also cross above the downtrend line, this would likely coincide with a breakout of the channel in the price action. Zooming right out into the 2-week chart there are very important implications to take into account. Firstly, bearish divergence continues to be a very dangerous consideration for the bulls. As the price action has risen, the Stochastic RSI and the Relative Strength Index have continued their downtrends. On such a high time frame this is the kind of thing that puts an end to a bull market. However, there is still the chance that the bearish divergence can be nullified, especially if $BTC embarks on a prolonged multi-month price rise. The first sign of just such a rise could be the change in the Stochastic RSI indicators. These indicators generally travel all the way to the bottom once they cross down, but in this case it looks as though the 50.00 level could act as support, allowing the indicators to head back up again. This could be a hugely bullish event for the $BTC price, and can signal a return to strong upside price momentum. Right at the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator will need to cross up through the descending trendline and start on the long climb to take it above 87.7 and nullify the bearish divergence.",cryptodaily.co.uk,2025-10-01T08:52:25Z,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/bitcoin-btc-nears-key-breakout-level-price-analysis-and-predictions,2025-10-01 17:27:02.143264,-0.09019607843137256
Wyandotte County may ban homeless people from sleeping outside: 'There's nowhere to go',"Wyandotte County lawmakers are poised to pass an ordinance that advocates say would effectively criminalize homelessness by making it illegal to sleep outside without a permit. The Board of Commissioners of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, could vote on the measure as early as this Thursday, Oct. 2. A meeting agenda is not yet published online. People found sleeping or camping outside without a temporary permit from the Unified Government could face citations of up to $200 and jail stays of up to a month. The ordinance states that ""the purpose of this chapter is to maintain streets, parks and other public property and areas within the city in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition to adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the community."" It cites bodily fluids, pests and trash found on camping sites as immediate threats to the health and public safety of residents. The Unified Government's Public Safety Works Committee voted to advance the proposal on Sept. 22. Commissioners Tom Burroughs, Phil Lopez, Mike Kane and Bill Burns did not respond to KCUR's requests for comments. If the ordinance passes its final vote Thursday, advocacy groups around Kansas City, Kansas, worry about a lack of other options for unhoused residents. Wyandotte County does not have a permanent overnight shelter, and there does not seem to be current plans to create one. Susila Jones, executive director of the nonprofit Cross-Lines Community Outreach, says her organization has waiting lists full of people looking for housing, who will become even more vulnerable. ""It's the worst feeling as a service provider when you're telling someone who wants a safe place to be that there's nowhere to go,"" Jones said. ""It's really difficult already and this will make it even more difficult."" Jones wants to see lawmakers focus on expanding permanent housing opportunities in order to combat homelessness, ""rather than try[ing] to shuffle it under the rug."" Another concern is about enforcement. Community members say that Wyandotte County law enforcement should be focused on stopping crime, rather than issuing citations to people who sleep outdoors. And Jones adds that increased interactions with law enforcement could worsen conditions for unhoused people -- who would find it difficult to get to court and pay fines. Wyandotte County's ordinance follows similar policies targeting homelessness across the country. Missouri's legislature passed a law three years ago that made sleeping on state-owned property a Class C misdemeanor. The Missouri Supreme Court later struck down the law for violating the constitution's single-subject rule. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling allowing cities to ban camping in public, more than 100 places across the country introduced anti-homeless legislation. ""Homelessness is not a moral failure, and for people that are experiencing homelessness to be criminalized because they have no safe place to go is, in my opinion, unlawful,"" said Ondra Penn, facility manager for the Wilhelmina Gill Multi-Service Center in Wyandotte County. The Willa Gill Center provides clothing, personal hygiene kits, telephone access, mail pick-up and long-term case management services to unhoused residents. Penn emphasized the need for not only an overnight shelter in Wyandotte County, but also more facilities with wraparound services to assist people dealing with mental health and substance abuse issues. Tom Lally, CEO and president of Hillcrest Transitional Housing, urged Wyandotte County leaders to pause and work instead on community-oriented solutions, rather than ""going from point A to point B at 100 miles an hour."" He says this ordinance may lessen visible homelessness only by forcing people to move to other parts of the metro without proper resources. ""Let's get them the needed services that they desire and they require, and get them on the right path,"" said Lally. ""We don't need to put them in jail.""","KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Ministry of Education honours winners of Cyber Eco and Cybersecurity Curricula projects,"DOHA: The Private Schools and Kindergartens Department at the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in cooperation with the National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) and Digital Safety, organised a ceremony to honour the winners of the ""Cyber Eco"" project and the ""Educational Cybersecurity Curricula"" project at the Ministry's headquarters. The ceremony was held in the presence of H E Dr. Ibrahim bin Saleh Al-Nuaimi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, H E Eng Abdulrahman Ali Muhammad Al Farahid Al Malki, President of the National Cyber Security Agency, and a number of directors from the Ministry and the NCSA, along with school principals, teachers, students, and parents. In a speech on this occasion, Al-Nuaimi, stated, ""The impact of these initiatives has extended to include more than (400) schools from various sectors, benefiting thousands of students, teachers, and parents. These blessed efforts are the fruit of the State of Qatar's focus on investing in quality education. Thousands of students have benefited from the initiative through intensive awareness and training programs that contributed to refining their digital skills and instilling a culture of safe technology use, which helps them face challenges and gives them the confidence to deal with the demands of the digital age with awareness and responsibility."" Ahmed Al Hammadi, Director General of the National Cyber Security Agency, confirmed that the Curricula project targeted 433 public and private schools within the state, and the awareness content was delivered to more than 583,000 male and female students. Furthermore, teachers and students around the world benefited from the open platform that includes the educational content and learning resources specific to this project. He added, ""At the level of the Cyber Eco project, 207 schools were visited, and awareness content was delivered to 10,608 male and female students."" He pointed out that teachers and students' parents were at the core of both projects' focus through training workshops that targeted 353 teachers and 500 parents. He concluded his speech by affirming that the partnership between the National Cyber Security Agency and the Ministry of Education and Higher Education is continuous and will soon result in the launch of the second phase of the Curricula project. This will enhance the positive impact achieved in the first phase, leading to the NCSA's main goal: to promote a secure cyber environment for students. A total of 15 male and female students, 10 schools, and 4 Ministry leaders who played a role in the project's success were honored. The programme included field visits to schools to assess the students' ability to study and apply the educational curricula for cybersecurity and Cyber Eco, an initiative aiming to increase students' awareness of the best ways to protect digital information through innovative workshops and activities to enhance cybersecurity understanding.",The Peninsula,2025-10-01T09:07:01Z,https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/01/10/2025/ministry-of-education-honours-winners-of-cyber-eco-and-cybersecurity-curricula-projects,2025-10-01 17:27:02.144128,0.5137254901960784
"Housing market : Property prices steady in Luxembourg, but construction continues to lag","As the third quarter of 2025 closes, the state of the property market is mixed. Prices, which had been rising for some time, stabilised between July and September and even dropped in some categories since the first quarter: down by 1% for existing houses and 1.7% for new-build apartments. These figures are based on averages calculated by real estate portal atHome at the beginning of October. Analysts at the Cloche d'Or-based group describe this as ""a transition stage"", but the question is: towards what? For new builds, difficulties persist. As housing market expert Julien Licheron of the Habitat Observatory notes, off-plan sales (VEFA) remain at just half their pre-crisis level. Meanwhile, the shortage of housing in Luxembourg continues to worsen, a concern also raised by construction industry representatives. The housing support package, introduced last year and extended until summer 2025, helped to partially revitalise the Luxembourg property market. However, this renewed activity was seen almost exclusively in the resale market, where volumes returned to near pre-crisis levels. While this was welcome news for buyers and sellers of existing properties, these transactions did not contribute to increasing the housing stock, which represents a major problem for Luxembourg. With around 10,000 new arrivals each year, the country urgently needs more housing construction, yet has fallen far short. Very few new builds have been completed in the past two years, further straining a market already under pressure for more than a decade. The expiration of the housing package is expected to weigh even more heavily on off-plan sales. The package's tax incentives were designed to draw investors back into the market but failed to attract the big players in rental investment. Meanwhile, the government stepped in to purchase development projects, yet without significantly increasing the annual supply of affordable housing. Without new construction, pressure on the private housing market will only grow. Housing support schemes are not a cure-all either. Over the past 18 months they appear to have contributed to a ""mechanical rise"" (for editor: or ""automatic rise""?) in new-build prices. This suggests Luxembourg can no longer rely on past mechanisms such as accelerated depreciation to offset low construction levels. Stakeholders are now searching for ""new solutions"". Among the proposals, the Chamber of Skilled Trades has called for the introduction of zero-interest loans for first-time buyers.",RTL Today,2025-10-01T07:41:45Z,https://today.rtl.lu/news/luxembourg/a/2341562.html,2025-10-01 17:27:02.144473,-0.04313725490196074
Budget 2026: Christmas Bonus bombshell as social welfare hikes may go further than expected - Irish Mirror,"Budget 2026 is expected to cut 'universal' cost of living handouts but may include a Christmas Bonus and a €12 rise in core social welfare rates. Budget 2026 is just days away, and households across Ireland are eagerly waiting to see what support measures - if any - will be offered to help ease the ongoing cost of living crisis. Last year's social welfare package was worth €1.2 billion and included once off lump sum payments ranging from €100 to €400, double welfare payments such as the Christmas Bonus and a €12 per week rise in core welfare rates. Every household also benefited from €250 off their electricity bills through two €125 credits - a measure many hoped would return, particularly as several energy companies have recently announced price hikes. But hopes of a repeat have largely been dashed. Taoiseach Micheal Martin has already confirmed that there will be no ""universal"" cost of living payments this time around, while Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe was even more direct, stating that the Government ""will not repeat"" last year's widespread handouts. Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers also quashed rumours of a new €80 energy credit, saying: ""I don't expect them to be part of Budget 2026."" Despite this, speculation is now mounting that social welfare recipients could see a significant boost. According to the Irish Examiner, Government sources indicate that Social Protection Minister Dara Calleary is pressing for the annual Christmas Bonus, which provides a once off double payment of a person's usual rate ahead of the festive season. One source told the paper that the Christmas Bonus has become almost a ""permanent fixture"", citing its prevalence in recent budgets. Calleary is also reportedly pushing for a €12 increase in core social welfare rates. The weekly increase would follow a similar €12 rise in Budget 2025, which benefited around 27 groups. Speaking in the Dail on Tuesday, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said the overall social protection package could reach €1.8 billion. However, many major decisions for next Tuesday's Budget will go down to the wire, with agreements expected either on Sunday or Monday, including for the Social Protection budget. The full details of Budget 2026 will be revealed when Ministers Paschal Donohoe and Jack Chambers officially present the financial package on Tuesday, October 7.",Irish mirror,2025-10-01T09:03:56Z,https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/politics/budget-2026-christmas-bonus-bombshell-35994214,2025-10-01 17:27:02.144773,0.4980392156862745
"Inter Milan 3-0 Slavia - Dream start, no room for complacency","Inter Milan eased past Slavia Prague in their second Champions League game last night, cruising to a 3-0 victory at San Siro. According to Gazzetta dello Sport via FCInterNews, the Nerazzurri cannot afford to get complacent despite a 'wonderful' start. After a 2-0 win at Ajax in the opening round, Inter thumped the Czech champions to maintain their perfect European record. Indeed, Cristian Chivu has won both Champions League games in charge of the San Siro giants without conceding. However, there's no room for complacency. Last night's win marked Inter's fourth consecutive triumph in all competitions. More importantly, the Italian heavyweights head into the Champions League round three boasting a +5 goal difference. Keen to secure direct last-16 qualification, Inter must not let their guard down in the upcoming fixtures. Therefore, victories against Kairat Almaty and Royale Union Saint-Gilloise will be imperative. That rings particularly true when factoring in Inter's next rivals in the league phase.

Keeping Your Apartment Secure | Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"According to ADT, apartments are broken into far more frequently than houses. Here are some tips for keeping your apartment safe. See how the windows, doors and sliding doors (if you have them) are secured. You can ask your landlord if it's okay for you to install additional locks or even a security system or camera. A deadbolt is a must. If your landlord doesn't want you to install something permanent, there are portable options, such as door security bars (also called door jammers). These are angled bars that can be wedged between the doorknob and floor to provide extra reinforcement should someone try to break in. Items like door jammers are great to protect you when you're home, but most robberies occur when you're not there. If your landlord doesn't allow a security system that has to be screwed into the wall consider a DIY security system. These are attached with peel-and-stick adhesive. Wireless and battery-operated products also tend to create less damage than wired products. Amazon's Alexa also offers security features: Alexa Guard can turn your Alexa-connected Echo devices into listening devices that sense sounds like breaking glass or footsteps, and Alexa Intruder Alert allows you to program Alexa devices to flash the lights, shout at the intruder, or play loud music or an alarm sound. Of course, it's always a smart idea to get renters insurance. It's an inexpensive way for you to get some peace of mind in case you have to replace things that are stolen.

Guest nights booked online continue solid growth,"In the second quarter of 2025, guests spent 245.9 million nights in short-term rental accommodation in the EU, booked via Airbnb, Booking or Expedia. As the first quarter of the year already indicated, 2025 is looking like a promising year for tourism. The total number of guest nights in the second quarter of 2025 increased by 17.8% compared with the same quarter of 2024 and by 36.8% compared with the second quarter of 2023. Nights spent in short-stay accommodation increased by 34.3% in April 2025, compared with April 2024, mostly due to the Easter holidays, which took place in April this year. This increase was followed by a more modest growth of 5.3% in May 2025 and a bigger bump of 18.1% in June 2025, compared with their respective months in 2024. This information comes from monthly data on short-stay accommodation offered via online platforms. Today, Eurostat published the data for the second quarter of 2025 at national level and the first quarter of 2025 at regional level. This news article presents several highlights from the more detailed Statistics Explained article.

Three farms of land in Limerick go under the hammer in a week for close to €2m,"IT WAS a busy week for GVM's auction room in Kilmallock Mart with three highly successful sales of land in Kilmallock, Athlacca and Castletown. The first two auctions took place on Friday, September 12 with GVM Kilmallock's Richard Ryan starting proceedings with a 35.5 acre residential roadside farm at Millmount, Kilmallock (pictured below). The lands are of excellent quality, laid out in easily managed, well-sheltered fields, ideal for livestock or dairy farming. Farm buildings include a haybarn, cattle pen, crush, and ancillary outbuildings. The property included a single-storey farmhouse, which was in need of complete refurbishment. READ NEXT: Prime Limerick land sold for €6m, bought back for €450k and now goes sale agreed at €4m Mr Ryan said a significant feature is the River Loobagh, which runs along a generous stretch of the boundary. ""The farm benefits from ample road frontage and is divided by the main Dublin-Cork railway line. However, a viaduct connects both sections, ensuring uninterrupted access,"" he said. The property was offered for sale in its entirety. The bids came from both in house and through the online LSL facility with a modest opening bid of €350,000. Mr Ryan had to use all his skill and experience to arrive at €530,000 where a recess was called. After the break more bids were invited but the bid remained at €530,000. There was another short recess and on returning the property was placed on the market. At that juncture two further bids followed with the hammer coming down at €540,000 in favour of well known Limerick city based estate agent JC Gubbins, who was believed to have been representing a well-known local family. Commenting after the auction, Mr Ryan said that it was a property that offered great potential given that there was an existing residence and it was well situated on the outskirts of Kilmallock. He was satisfied with the price achieved which was in line with the vendors' expectations. Drombeg, Athlacca The second offering was a 64 acre residential roadside farm situated at Drombeg, Athlacca (pictured at top of the page). The lands, which are of excellent quality, are all in permanent pasture and are laid out in easily managed well-sheltered fields. The Morning Star river flows along the southern boundary. There is a haybarn with lean-tos, open slurry pit and ancillary out offices. The residence is a traditional farmhouse which is maintained in good decorative order throughout. The property was first offered for sale in lots. Lot 1, 59.5 acres reached €660,000. Lot 2, a 4.5 acre holding including the residence and yard only received one bid of €250,000.00. However, it was lot 3 (the entire) that truly lit the fuse in the room with a combined bid of €910,000. Mr Ryan looked for offers in excess of it and wasn't disappointed as there was a rapid exchange of bids from three in-house bidders. A recess was called at €1,110,000. On returning, Mr Ryan declared that he had received instructions to place the entire property on the market. A number of minutes later his gavel came down in favour of a County Kerry based in-house bidder at a very impressive €1,250,000 or €19,531 an acre. After the auction, Mr Ryan said that the property was well presented for sale with a large portion of the land reseeded in recent years. Both he and the vendors expressed satisfaction with the price achieved. Mr Ryan noted there were two disappointed underbidders still seeking similar holdings, underlining the strong demand for quality farms in the area. Ballyguile and Ballynoe, Castletown The third auction took place a week later on Friday, September 19. A roadside farm extending to 39.75 acres at Ballyguile and Ballynoe, Castletown (pictured below) was offered in a number of lots. The lands were all in permanent pasture and were of varying quality. Some areas are considered good quality, while others, being of a heavier nature, are regarded as reasonably good grazing land that would benefit from improvement works to reach their full potential. The farm did contain a considerable amount of road frontage Both lot 1 and lot 4 sold under the hammer to online bidders. Lot 1, 14.25 acre roadside holding sold for €165,000.00 while lot 4, 1 acre made €10,000. Lot 2 failed to get an opening offer as did lot 3 which was a combination of lot 1 and 2 combined. Lot 2, 24.5 acres with yard is now available for sale by private treaty and Mr Ryan is confident that it won't be around for long as his phone is busy with enquiries since the auction.","Limerick Today: News, Sport, Jobs, Property, Cars, Entertainments & More",2025-10-01T09:00:12Z,https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/farming/1907609/three-farms-of-land-in-limerick-go-under-the-hammer-in-a-week-for-close-to-2m.html,2025-10-01 17:27:02.146183,0.2705882352941176
Bitcoin price eyes $115K as spot BTC ETFs see $429M inflows,"Bitcoin price is holding above $114,000 as institutional demand strengthens, with spot exchange-traded funds registering their largest inflows in weeks. At press time, BTC traded at $114,400, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 1.5% over the week. Over the last 30 days, the asset has gained 6.1% and now sits just 7.9% below its record high of $124,128 reached on Aug. 14. Daily trading volume came in at $56.3 billion, down 6.1% from the previous session, hinting at lighter activity in spot markets. In derivatives, Coinglass data shows mixed conditions. Bitcoin (BTC) futures volume rose 2% to $80.95 billion, while open interest slipped slightly by 0.5% to $81.79 billion. This suggests traders are active but keeping leverage in check. ETF flows continue to drive optimism as October begins. Data from SoSoValue shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $429.9 million in net inflows on Sept. 30, marking a second straight day of gains. BlackRock's IBIT led the way with $199.4 million, followed by Ark Invest's ARKB at $105.7 million and Fidelity's FBTC with $54.7 million. No ETF reported outflows, pushing total monthly inflows to $3.53 billion. Analysts suggest this trend could extend into Q4. Over the past year, Bitcoin's market capitalization has increased from $870 billion to $1.07 trillion, with average daily inflows of $385 million, according to Carmelo Alemán, a contributor to CryptoQuant. Large wallet accumulation and cautious miner selling indicate a structurally bullish market, and record-high global liquidity may help BTC's rise even more. Alemán argued that these factors set the stage for a new all-time high, with an ambitious projection of $180,000 within Q4. Bitcoin is consolidating just below the $115,000 resistance level. Bollinger Bands indicate that volatility is likely to increase as the price leans toward the upper band. While the stochastic reading of 61 suggests the market is not yet overheated, the relative strength index is at 54, indicating neutral momentum. The bullish case is supported majority of moving averages. The 200-day simple moving average at $104,920 offers a solid floor, and both the short- and long-term averages are still in buy territory. A strong breakout above $115,000 could open the door to August's high, which is close to $124,000. Immediate support lies around $113,000. In a bullish scenario, if institutional accumulation and ETF demand persist, Bitcoin could rise to new highs. Although the overall structure is still supportive, a bearish turn would probably result in a retest of $110,000.",crypto.news,2025-10-01T09:07:01Z,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-price-spot-btc-etfs-record-net-inflows-2025/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.146478,0.2784313725490195

"Student whose bank account was used in fake SAF bulk order scams gets jail, in first such sentencing","SINGAPORE: A foreign student in need of money sold her bank account details for cash. It was later used to funnel almost S$18,000 (US$13,980) in scam proceeds, with most of the money coming from a fake Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) bulk order scam. Rajadi Rajasinghe Manamendra Patabadilage Vishwa Madavi, a 22-year-old Sri Lankan, was sentenced to jail for three months and two weeks. She was also fined S$1,100. If she does not pay the fine, she will have to serve three days' jail in default. She pleaded guilty to one count under the Computer Misuse Act of of abetting an unknown person by giving her bank login details to them for an illegal purpose. This is the first time a person linked to a spate of bulk order scams by people impersonating personnel from the SAF has been sentenced, and the first time the details of how the scam worked came to light. Rajadi faced financial difficulties in September this year and her friends told her about an unknown person, purportedly from Sri Lanka, whom she could sell her bank account details to for money. Rajadi obtained the contact details from her friends and sold her DBS account details to him for S$1,100. After relinquishing her account to the person, more than S$30,000 was deposited in the account and later withdrawn. The amount includes a sum of S$16,000 from a 59-year-old Singaporean victim who owns Karu's Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant. The victim received a phone call from a man identifying himself as Marcus on Sep 2. He claimed to be calling from Stagmont Camp and requested to place an order for 150 biryani meals worth S$2,325 from the victim's restaurant. Marcus said he would collect the order two days later and pay upon collection. The victim accepted the order and liaised with Marcus periodically in the following days about the preparation. On the morning of Sep 4, Marcus contacted the victim and asked him to buy 40 ready-to-eat meals from a person called Kelvin, a distributor for such meals, on Marcus' behalf. Marcus claimed he needed help as there was ""a lengthy process within the army for him to obtain approval"" to buy such meals directly from Kelvin. Marcus promised to pay the victim for the 40 meals together with the 150 biryani orders when he collected the food later that day. The victim agreed and ordered 40 ready-to-eat meals from Kelvin, whose contact details were provided by Marcus. Kelvin insisted that he be paid S$8,000 to confirm the order, and the victim did so via PayNow. Kelvin said the meals would be delivered later that day. Marcus then contacted the victim again and asked him to order 80 more such meals from Kelvin. The victim did so and paid another S$16,000 to Kelvin on Kelvin's request. At about 5pm on Sep 4, Marcus asked the victim to order more meals from Kelvin. This time, the victim noted that Marcus had not collected the biryani. The ready-to-eat meals had also not been delivered by Kelvin. Suspecting he had fallen for a scam, the victim lodged a police report. Of the sum that went through Rajadi's bank account, another S$1,980 was from a 48-year-old female scam victim who had received a WhatsApp message asking for a loan from a person posing as her cousin. The WhatsApp account had been compromised. The police froze Rajadi's DBS account on Sep 4 with about S$89 inside. The prosecutor sought a sentence of between three-and-a-half and four months' jail and a fine of S$1,100 to disgorge the profit Rajadi had made by giving up her bank account. Rajadi was remanded and made her mitigation plea through a Sinhalese interpreter. She said she was very sorry for what she did, and that she did not know the gravity of the offence at the time. ""I ran into financial difficulties. My mother was a heart patient and she was unable to send me money,"" she said. ""I had no choice, I borrowed from friends. However, they threatened me, then some of my friends suggested selling the bank account details, I agreed."" She said she was deeply remorseful. ""Your honour, I came here to study. I have disappointed my mother. Please give me a chance,"" said Rajadi, pleading for the minimum sentence. In sentencing, the judge noted the prevalence of scams and related offences. For disclosing her bank account login details for an illegal purpose, Rajadi could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$50,000, or both.",CNA,2025-10-01T09:06:53Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/student-jail-fake-saf-bulk-order-scam-bank-account-5379556,2025-10-01 17:27:02.147062,-0.1686274509803921

Better Crypto Buy: Chainlink vs. BNB | The Motley Fool,"The question for investors here is, between these two coins, where can value compound more broadly over time? Chainlink's core job is to bring real-world data onto blockchains and move messages and tokens across them. That makes it an indispensable piece of infrastructure for the entire crypto sector, as many different applications require a structured data import functionality for the backend. Its data catalog covers price feeds, proof-of-reserves, and macroeconomic stats. Plus, it also offers CCIP, a cross-chain interoperability protocol that lets applications ship tokens and messages from one chain to another. The investment thesis for buying begins and ends with its impressive fee flywheel. Decentralized applications (dApps) pay user fees for Chainlink data oracle services. Those fees support its node operators and, via staking, the network's security. As more apps integrate data feeds, more fees show up to fund the development of more data services, which attracts more apps, and also a wider variety of them. Importantly, CCIP's billing model lets developers pay a single fee denominated in LINK on the chain where the data gets used, thereby significantly simplifying cost predictability and making the service easier to adopt at scale, as well as across blockchains. This scheme also ensures that projects operating on multiple chains can keep the portion of their working capital that's used to pay data fees distributed based on data usage. App deployments on smaller or less-used networks are less economically burdensome as a result, lowering the barrier for cross-chain expansion. There is evidence the core value generation loop is working. Chainlink is the category leader by revenue in the crypto interoperability segment, generating $9.6 million in revenue over the last three years. Furthermore, large financial institutions have tested or used Chainlink to move and verify fund data across chains, and the U.S. government is even using it to publish economic data to the blockchain now. Chainlink's neutral, multi-chain posture positions it to earn fees wherever activity shows up, rather than betting on one chain's success. That makes it resilient, and it will be exposed to a lot of growth over the coming years as well. BNB is the utility token for the Binance exchange's ecosystem. Holders use it for trading fee discounts on Binance, and as the gas fee asset on the BNB Smart Chain, and also for its layer-2 (L2) chains. So right off the bat, this coin's chosen field of competition is fairly constrained, as the Binance ecosystem is almost entirely dedicated to providing crypto exchange services. BNB's tokenomics include ways to burn tokens and thus increase the value of it for holders. There's an auto-burn mechanism, which aims to reduce supply over time toward a 100 million BNB target, and a real-time fee burning mechanism that's based on activity on the network. As of today, the circulating supply is near 139 million, implying there is still a meaningful path to the stated supply target, so new buyers would benefit from this process playing out over time, assuming it continues. The strategic challenge here, as stated before, is that most of BNB's utility is bounded by Binance's footprint. While it's true that Binance is a systemically important crypto exchange platform, and a titan within the space, the coin's growth fully depends on continued adoption of BNB Chain and its L2s, plus the durability of trader-targeted benefits like trading fee discounts on Binance itself. And the BNB Chain, while effective at being a platform for the needs of Binance's exchange, is not itself a network with any notable competitive advantages, despite its decently fast settlement times and relatively low usage fees. Plus, its inseparable relation with Binance itself carries plenty of idiosyncratic risk. In late 2023, Binance entered a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, agreeing to extensive compliance reforms, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (more famously known as CZ) later received and served a short prison sentence in 2024. The exchange is still on questionable legal footing in the U.S., and suspended its operations there in late 2024. Could BNB still surprise to the upside if you buy it now? It's possible, if the growth of the crypto exchange leads to more on-chain activity, which then accelerates fee-based burns. But in comparison to Chainlink's chain-agnostic fee capture across many ecosystems, BNB's upside is structurally tied to a single brand and stack. Chainlink's business model lets it monetize wherever crypto grows, and its fee flywheel is already spinning. BNB remains compelling for believers in Binance's platform, but its opportunity set is far narrower and carries more single-ecosystem risk, as well as legal risks. Therefore, Chainlink is the better long-term buy for investors seeking exposure to crypto's broadening utility rather than a single venue's expansion.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:40:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-crypto-buy-chainlink-vs-bnb/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.148642,0.2549019607843137
Deepway signs distribution agreement in Oman,"Deepway Technology Company, a Chinese manufacturer of new energy heavy trucks, has signed a distribution agreement in Oman, as the company steps up its overseas expansion by targeting markets in the Middle East. The agreement, signed in Oman's capital city of Muscat with local dealer group Top Autos LLC, is the company's second distribution deal in the region, having recently established a similar partnership in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Deepway said the new deal creates a ""complementary north-south presence"" in the Gulf region. By providing a transportation link between the two countries, the company aims to strengthen its sales and service coverage and step up its growth momentum in the region. The company claims that its trucks are designed for long-distance haulage, offering high energy-efficiency and suitability for the region's extreme heat operating conditions. Deepway's entry into this market is also in line with the Omani government's target for 35% of new vehicles sales in the country to be electric by 2030, as part of the country's transition to a low carbon local economy.

In his new role, Ritchie will be responsible for overseeing daily operations, establishing strategic direction, and growing the team and local relationships in Bermuda.

"Fundamental Market Analysis for October 1, 2025 USDJPY for SAXO:USDJPY by Fresh-Forexcast2004","The summary of opinions from participants at the Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting in September showed that board members discussed the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. This confirmed market expectations that the central bank would stick to its policy normalization course. In addition, growing geopolitical tensions and the US government shutdown may continue to provide some support for the Japanese yen (JPY) as a safe-haven currency, which in turn could be a headwind for the USD/JPY pair. Meanwhile, the BoJ's stance differs significantly from forecasts that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut borrowing costs twice this year. The latter does not help the US dollar (USD) attract significant buyers. Moreover, the divergence in the policy outlooks of the Bank of Japan and the Fed should favor the lower-yielding Japanese yen and help limit the USD/JPY pair. Therefore, it would be wise to wait for strong follow-through buying before taking a position in anticipation of a significant strengthening.

PA MEDI can help take the mystery out of Medicare,"The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) is a national program set up to assist those eligible for Medicare as they navigate Medicare enrollment, coverage, options and other issues. In Pennsylvania, this program is called Pennsylvania Medicare Education and Decision Insight (PA MEDI). The Chester County PA MEDI program is staffed with a coordinator and volunteer counselors. Our local program coordinator and volunteer counselors operate within the Chester County Department of Aging. The counselors provide free, unbiased, confidential guidance with one-on-one counseling. Counselors are the key to the program. To become a PA MEDI counselor, the volunteer must pass a background check and go through a certification process that includes online training modules, classroom instruction, a competency exam and a period of working with a mentor before counseling clients on their own. Once certified, training continues with monthly meetings, webinars and regional updates. The counselors come from varied backgrounds and areas of expertise. ""Michael was phenomenal in helping me get my Medicare coverage in a very timely manner after I was having communication issues with Social Security Administration,"" said a client who received one-on-one counseling. Individuals have three different opportunities to enroll in Medicare. It is important to know the enrollment timelines for Medicare. People who have been collecting Social Security benefits before turning 65 will automatically be enrolled in Part A and Part B of Medicare upon turning 65. After the 24th month of Social Security disability, Medicare enrollment is also automatic. Otherwise, enrollment is required and should occur within the 7-month period surrounding the 65th birthday (3 months before, the month of the 65th birthday and 3 months after). This is the Initial Enrollment Period (IEP). There are two other opportunities for Medicare enrollment. These are SEPs and the GEP. A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) is available if leaving employer coverage after working beyond Medicare eligibility. If a beneficiary misses the IEP and an SEP, there is a General Enrollment Period (GEP) each year from Jan. 1 - March 31. Each enrollment period has different rules, which can be confusing. PA MEDI counselors are acquainted with these enrollment periods and the rules for each. Counselors can help beneficiaries understand what applies to their individual situations. There are still some important decisions to make even when Medicare enrollment has been completed. At the time of Medicare eligibility beneficiaries may want to consider options for help with medical expenses, such as a Medigap policy, a Medicare Advantage Plan and a Part D Prescription Plan. PA MEDI counselors can provide detailed information on all these options. Counselors have access to an actuarial website that provides important Medigap considerations, such as pricing, that are not usually included in the advertising brochures flooding your mail and inbox. During personalized, one-on-one counseling sessions, clients are routinely screened for eligibility for government assistance programs such as Medicaid, Extra Help, Medicare Savings Program, and PACE. Counselors will provide assistance with applications for these programs, if needed. ""I'm researching Medigap and Part D plans for my sister and have some questions as the medicare.gov is a bit confusing,"" one client said. In-person, one-on-one counseling takes place at local senior centers or other community sites. We can also counsel beneficiaries by phone or Zoom. Counseling is available year-round, but the busiest time is during the Annual Open Enrollment Period (AOEP) from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. One-on-one sessions during the AOEP include a review of Prescription Drug Plans and Medicare Advantage Plans using the Medicare website Plan Finder tool. These reviews may help beneficiaries find a new plan that can save hundreds, even thousands, of dollars over the course of the year. ""For the past two years you have been of great assistance with helping me to enroll in Medicare Part D Prescription Plans,"" said one client. ""Your assistance has saved me at least several thousand dollars this past year. ""Thanks so much for all your time and patience with us as we navigated the Medicare Part D world with you. Your knowledgeable assistance is the reason we are able to save money and understand the process so that we can make the necessary decisions -- we can't thank you enough."" Counselors help clients with all kinds of issues and questions related to Medicare coverage: understanding a bill, what procedures are covered, how to change plans when moving, how to file an appeal when a service has been denied, how to apply for some of the assistance programs. Quite often PA MEDI counselors are asked to help with difficult situations. These might involve issues of lost coverage, inadequate coverage or inability to get coverage. PA MEDI has direct contact with other agencies. ""I am beyond frustrated,"" one client said. ""I have been unsuccessful after multiple times trying. At one point it (the Social Security website) locked me out."" Group presentations are also available in the community at local libraries, churches and senior centers. Attendance at these presentations is by reservation only. The schedule and instructions for registration are available at https://www.chesco.org/calendar.aspx?CID=22 You can also call the Help Line for information at 610-344-5004, Option 2. ""Medicare 101"" is a presentation for individuals becoming eligible for Medicare and provides a great opportunity to learn the basics of enrollment and coverage. People who attend a Medicare 101 presentation ask more informed questions at their one-on-one sessions. ""Medicare 102"" is especially informative for those already enrolled in Medicare. ""Medicare 102"" presentations include such topics as Medicare-covered preventive services, outpatient therapy, home health services, medical equipment, diabetic supplies, fraud prevention and more. "" Medicare Open Enrollment -- Fine Tune Your Medicare"" presentations help to make beneficiaries aware of changes that can be made during the Medicare Annual Open Enrollment Period to get the most out of Medicare during the next year. ""You have such a great way of presenting the information which really helps to reduce one's anxiety over trying to figure out the complex world of Medicare,"" a client said about the presentations. ""Very thorough."" ""I know what to do now,"" said another. ""Better than expected."" The overriding goal for our PA MEDI program is to educate and provide information that gives Medicare beneficiaries the tools to better understand and navigate their medical coverage, ultimately to have best access to their care. Contact for PA MEDI can be by phone on our Help Line (610-344-5004, Option 2) or by email (smilam@chesco.org). Counselors pick up these messages daily and return calls within one business day. The website www.chesco.org/477/PA-MEDI has a collection of articles and newsletters with information on many topics relating to Medicare.

The Best Growth Stocks to Buy With $100 Right Now | The Motley Fool,"In a thriving bull market, growth stocks usually lead the pack. The market is back to strong growth this year as tariffs, inflation, and increasing unemployment don't seem to be derailing it. The S&P 500 is up 13% year to date, and it's a great time for growth investors to buy great stocks that are moving up. Even if you only have $100 to invest today, you can take part in some excellent growth stories. If you have $100 to invest monthly, you will be able to benefit from the consistent additions and the magic of compounding over time. SoFi Technologies (SOFI -4.05%), Lemonade (LMND -1.65%), and Nu Holdings (NU 0.38%) are three top growth stocks to add to your portfolio, and you can buy at least a share of each for about $100 or less. SoFi likes to call itself the only one-stop shop for digital money management. It sees itself as differentiated from the large pack of neo-banks because it offers a broad array of services, and that model resonates with an upwardly mobile class of younger consumers who want to engage with financial management from their smartphones. Growth has been impressive. Adjusted net revenue increased 44% year over year in the second quarter, an acceleration. Management attributes the faster increase to an upward spiral that starts with an easy-to-use platform that attracts new clients; a complete assortment of services that generates higher engagement; and more money plowed back into the business to upgrade, add new tools, and become even more attractive. It's also a low-cost model that breeds loyalty. There are no physical branches, and customers typically start out with one product, which means a relatively low acquisition cost. But as each customer signs up for more products, they come with a high lifetime value. SoFi's target market is customers who are just getting started in managing their money, and this cohort has a long financial road ahead of it. It's no wonder the market sees tremendous opportunities here and is rewarding SoFi stock accordingly: It's up more than 225% during the past year. Lemonade is another disruptor in its industry. It offers most types of insurance, but it's all built with artificial intelligence (AI), and customers are flocking to its online platform. Its top line has grown rapidly for years, but it's taken some time for it to gather enough data to price policies competitively and drive profitability. That's finally happening, and Lemonade stock is finally taking off; it's up more than 200% during the past year. For insurance companies, the first step toward profit is reducing the loss ratio, or the average amount of policy premiums paid out as claims. That requires some serious underwriting skills, and it naturally takes time to collect enough customers, assess patterns, and create algorithms to make the business work. Lemonade's goal is to keep its loss ratio under 75%, and it was 70% for the trailing 12 months in the second quarter, or nine percentage points lower than the year before. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and net income are following. Management said it expects adjusted EBITDA to become positive next year, with positive net income in 2027. Lemonade has been able to keep its operating expenditures steady despite the business growing at a fast pace, leading to increasing cash flow. This is just the beginning. Lemonade has an edge over legacy insurance companies, and look for it to take a big leap forward in the coming years. Nu is taking banking to a new level in its home country of Brazil, as well as its newer markets of Mexico and Colombia. Its founders were frustrated by the barriers to banking services for the mass market, and Nu's all-digital platform provides access to the financial system for every type of customer. Its low-fee, user-friendly model appeals to these customers, who were previously locked out of the system, but it's also catching on with affluent consumers who are dissatisfied with the stodgy incumbent banks. That's leading to consistently outstanding results. Revenue increased 40% year over year in the second quarter (on a currency neutral basis), and it added 4.1 million customers in the quarter and 18 million in the trailing 12 months, a 17% increase. As an all-digital player, it has low costs, and profitability has been soaring; second-quarter net income increased 42% to $637 million. Even in Brazil, where it already has 60% of the adult population as customers, it's adding new members at a rapid pace. It's also finding new ways to monetize them, cross-selling and upselling new products and services to users who are still getting started in engaging with the financial system. It has many growth drivers, from adding new customers to monetizing existing ones, as well as entering new markets and adding new features and tools to the app. Nu has an incredible future, and now is a great time to buy.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:30:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/the-best-growth-stocks-to-buy-with-100-right-now/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.151263,0.5450980392156863
Pfizer and Pharma Stocks Rise After Trump Decision for NYSE:PFE by FXOpen,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Other Pharmaceutical Stocks Rise Following Trump's Decision According to media reports, US President Donald Trump launched a website allowing Americans to purchase medicines directly. He announced that Pfizer would offer some of its drugs on this platform and introduce new medicines to the US market at reduced prices. Trump added that his administration is working with other companies, including Eli Lilly, to reach ""similar agreements."" Reports state that Pfizer's deal with the Trump administration will enable patients to receive significant discounts. In return, the company will receive a three-year exemption from any tariffs. The news pushed pharmaceutical stocks to the top of yesterday's gainers list: → Pfizer Inc. (PFE) rose by 6.8% → Merck & Co Inc. (MRK) rose by 6.8% → Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) rose by 5.0% Technical analysis of the PFE chart The chart indicates that: → In the long term, PFE's share price remains in a bearish trend, highlighted by the descending orange channel. → However, in April the stock reached its lowest level in nearly 13 years, after which the price began showing an upward trajectory, forming higher highs and higher lows within the ascending blue channel. A strong fundamental driver yesterday caused PFE's share price to rebound sharply from the lower boundary of the blue channel towards its median, encountering little resistance when breaking through the September local barrier at $24.75. It is possible that positive market sentiment will persist and be leveraged by bulls to extend the rally. However, the real test of their resolve might come at resistance near the summer highs around $26.00. A more substantial obstacle might lie in the $27-27.50 area, where multiple resistances converge, including: → the upper boundaries of both the blue and orange channels; → key highs from the first half of 2025. Nonetheless, assuming the fundamental backdrop continues to be supported by positive news on progress in cancer treatments (Pfizer is conducting large-scale developments in this area, aided by its acquisition of Seagen, a pioneer in antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs), this could lead to an attempt to break the long-term downward trend as early as this year.

Liverpool gave me my chance - now I want young Scousers to get their shot in their own city,"As someone who was born and raised in Walton in the north of Liverpool, I feel I owe the city a great deal. Liverpool gave me my education, a lifelong passion for the creative arts and, crucially, a council grant that enabled me to graduate from the University of Cambridge. I want to give back to the city. That's what inspired me to join forces with Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram and Liverpool city council leader Liam Robinson in their task to launch Imagine Liverpool, a major regeneration board for the city. Imagine Liverpool is an ambitious and wide-ranging initiative, led by a passionate and multifaceted board of directors. We don't just want to attract some investment into Liverpool - it's about creating a large-scale vision to transform the city and its future. At the heart of this ambition is the Littlewoods Building on Edge Lane. With government support and the backing of my regeneration partners, we want to turn the historic building into a state-of-the-art film and television production hub. The hub will be complete with two major studios and a vocational training school for 16- to 18-year-olds to try and provide the same support I received at that age through my council grant. The school will sit inside a working production centre, giving students direct access to industry professionals. The creative industries are one of Britain's greatest economic success stories. They contribute over £100bn annually to our economy and employ more than two million people. Yet access to these careers is uneven. Opportunities remain concentrated in London and limited for those outside the capital. This project will help decentralise opportunity and ensure that young people in Liverpool, Manchester and across the North West can build careers in film, television and digital media without having to leave the areas they know best and hold dear. We've already made significant progress. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has committed up to £17m to the studios. Remediation work is complete. We have backing from the London Screen Academy to bring a proven model of vocational training to Liverpool. But to realise this vision, we need political support. We need government investment in this project, which has the potential to be transformational in so many areas. Early conversations with ministers have been encouraging, but we need extensive support to bring the idea to reality. The Littlewoods project aligns perfectly with national priorities. It will boost regional economies and expand vocational education. It's a chance for the government to show that it is serious about investing in the North and back a sector that not only drives growth but shapes our national identity. Liverpool has always punched above its weight in terms of cultural impact. From The Beatles to one of the most successful football clubs in the country Everton FC (and the other one that plays in red), the city has rarely ever been away from the limelight. Liverpool is the most filmed city in the UK outside of London. In TV alone, the city has provided the backdrop for several of the most impactful and captivating TV shows of recent years. From coming-of-age comedies such as G'Wed to gritty crime dramas such as This City Is Ours, Liverpool has continued to grow in prominence at the forefront of British television. However, despite Liverpool being the UK's second city on screen, the problem remains that talent continues to be funnelled in from elsewhere, with relatively few opportunities for locals. Now is the perfect time to create more opportunities for young Scousers to be able to proudly put their names on projects in their home city. I'm proud to be involved in this historical project and I am grateful for the support we have already received. With additional support from government - particularly the Department of Culture, Media and Sport - we can bring it to fruition. Let's make Liverpool the creative education hub it should be.",Politics Home,2025-10-01T09:06:24Z,https://www.politicshome.com/opinion/article/liverpool-gave-chance-now-want-young-scousers-get-shot-city,2025-10-01 17:27:02.151966,0.5058823529411764
Is #STX Ready to Make an Explosive Bullish Move? Must Watch   for BINANCE:STXUSDT by MyCryptoParadise,"Yello Paradisers! Are we about to witness a powerful breakout of #STX, or is a trap lurking right under our feet? Let's decode this #STXUSDT setup before it's too late: 💎#Stacks has been stuck in a clear falling wedge on the daily timeframe by consistently respecting both the descending resistance and descending support lines since late July. Price action is now compressing near the lower end of this structure, showing signs of potential accumulation. 💎Right now, #STXUSD is trading around $0.59, sitting just above the support zone at $0.51, and not far above the final demand zone at $0.40. This area is crucial. As long as bulls defend this zone, the structure remains intact and the bullish scenario is valid. 💎A confirmed breakout above the descending resistance, ideally with a retest of that line alongside support from the 50EMA, would flip this into a high-probability bullish setup. If that happens, we'll first be targeting the moderate resistance at $0.818. A sustained move above $0.818 opens the door toward the strong resistance at $1.018. That's your upside target, but only if we break the descending channel cleanly. 💎However, a break below $0.40 would invalidate this entire bullish structure. If this demand zone fails, the setup is broken, and the market could go on to sweep the lower liquidity zones, likely toward $0.30 and below. That's where over-leveraged bulls will get wiped out. Strive for consistency, wait for clear confirmations, and remember that discipline always beats chasing quick profits.

2 High-Yield ETFs to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid | The Motley Fool,"Investors looking for reliable option income ETFs should avoid the lure of huge yields and stick with something a bit more boring. Income-focused investors have plenty of options at their disposal when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). One type of ETF that is gaining a lot of traction today is option income ETFs. The big draw is large yields, but there are material risks to consider before you buy one of these funds. In the end, most investors will be better off with fairly simple options like Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO 0.18%) and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (IDVO 0.24%). The ultra-high yields on offer from ETFs like YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY 1.45%) could be a siren's song that hurts you more than helps you. Options are created when a person sells another person the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a future date. The person buying the right pays a fee to the person selling the right. The most common type of option is a covered call, in which a person who owns a stock sells someone the right to buy that stock at a future date. If the option is used (exercised), the stock must be sold. If the option is not exercised, nothing happens. Either way, the fee that is paid is kept by the stockholder. Selling covered calls is a fair amount of work and only more active, and probably aggressive, investors should use this income-generating approach. However, it is a way to create an additional income stream from your stock portfolio that could be valuable. This is where option income exchange-traded funds come in. Simply put, you don't have to do the work because someone else is doing it for you. Tread carefully with option income ETFs. There are some that offer dividend yields that just can't be sustained over the long term. And often, those same ETFs are so highly concentrated that there is material asset-specific risk (also called idiosyncratic risk) to consider. If you were going to sell covered calls to generate additional income from your dividend portfolio, you would likely start by building a portfolio of stocks you like. And then you would start looking at selling covered calls on those stocks. You would probably find that selling covered calls worked better at different times for different stocks, which would leave you strategically selling covered calls across the portfolio. This is what Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF both do. The difference between these two covered call ETFs is in the name. One is focused on international stocks and the other is U.S.-focused. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 30 stocks that are fairly well diversified by sector. And it sells covered calls on just a portion of the portfolio at any given time. That allows the owners of the ETF to generate extra income and benefit from capital appreciation, too. (Covered calls can limit the upside of a stock if the call is exercised.) Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 60 or so stocks, applying the same basic approach to foreign stocks. In both cases, the outcome has been a fairly reliable dividend over time, accompanied by a rising share price. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a yield of around 4.6%. Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a trailing 12-month yield of around 5.5%. Both are actively managed ETFs and have fairly high expense ratios of 0.56% and 0.66%, respectively. But if you are looking for consistent income from a covered-call strategy, these ETFs basically do what you would do if you chose to sell covered calls yourself. At the other extreme is YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF. It is actually just one of an entire family of option income ETFs offered by YieldMax. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's trailing 12-month yield is 81%. If that sounds too good to be true, it likely is. For starters, many of the YieldMax ETFs are focused on just one stock, and they use a complex options approach to generate income instead of buying the stock and then selling covered calls. That's a lot more aggressive than what either of the Amplify ETFs does. On top of that, option income can be highly variable from month to month for any given stock. Amplify addresses that issue by having a diversified portfolio and selling covered calls strategically. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy can't do that. The income it generates is entirely reliant on just one stock. As the chart below highlights, the income you actually collect can change dramatically each month. Then there's the risk posed by return of capital. Notice in the chart above how YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's price has declined over time. That's because it is paying so much out in dividends that it is depleting its capital. There are some fairly complex tax issues involved here, but from a practical point of view, you are getting some of your original investment back with each dividend you collect. The only way to avoid that is if the underlying stock goes up dramatically. That can happen for a period of time, but Wall Street has a habit of pushing up stocks and then eventually pushing them down again. There are no free lunches, as the saying goes. Meanwhile, the expense ratio for YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF is a lofty 1.27%. You are paying more for a less reliable income stream and the risk of your capital declining over time. To be fair, the huge yield numbers from YieldMax Option Income ETFs are very alluring. And perhaps for some investors, they will be a good fit. But if you are looking for a long-term investment, you should probably keep it simple and focus on option income ETFs that do what you would do. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF don't have the highest yields, but they do have much more sustainable investment approaches.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:25:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/high-yield-etf-buy-hand-over-fist-1-to-avoid/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.152757,0.07450980392156858
"Hajiji thanks Petronas for RM980,000 aid to Sabah flood victims | Borneo Post Online","KOTA KINABALU (Oct 1): Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor has expressed his appreciation to corporate companies, government-linked companies (GLCs) and NGOs that have stepped forward to assist disaster victims in Sabah, particularly Petronas and Yayasan Petronas, which have channelled aid worth RM980,000 so far this year. He said the contributions not only help ease the burden of flood victims but also demonstrate the private sector's concern in sharing responsibility with the State Government to safeguard the welfare of the people. ""The State Government greatly appreciates the contributions of Petronas and Yayasan Petronas. This effort reflects the strong commitment of the national energy company in ensuring the well-being of the people of Sabah, especially during flood disasters,"" he said when witnessing the symbolic handover of Petronas disaster relief contributions at Menara Kinabalu on Wednesday. The aid, which includes essential supplies, was presented by Petronas Sabah and Labuan Regional Office General Manager Siti Ayu Abdul Wahab to State Secretary Datuk Seri Panglima Safar Untong, who is also chairman of the State Disaster Management Committee. The latest contribution was made as part of preparations for the upcoming monsoon season. Siti Ayu said the initiative forms part of Petronas' ongoing commitment to support disaster preparedness and relief efforts in Sabah. ""Through close collaboration with state and federal agencies, we want to ensure that aid is delivered promptly when needed. This initiative is also planned proactively every year to strengthen preparedness for the flood season,"" she said. She added that Petronas also contributed equipment such as foldable mattresses, canopies, fans, drinking water supplies, food packs to the Malaysian Civil Defence Force (APM), as well as a donation card worth RM10,000 for fuel purchases to support relief operations. So far this year, Petronas and Yayasan Petronas have channelled a total of RM980,000 to support disaster preparedness and post-disaster relief in Sabah, including contributions made earlier this year. Hajiji stressed that the support of the private sector and NGOs is crucial in complementing government efforts and accelerating recovery for disaster victims. ""The State Government hopes more corporate companies will step forward to assist. With strong support like this, we can ensure that aid reaches the people in need quickly and effectively,"" he said.",Borneo Post Online,2025-10-01T09:03:45Z,https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/10/01/hajiji-thanks-petronas-for-rm980000-aid-to-sabah-flood-victims/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.153015,0.2392156862745098
Owner of CT funeral homes faces new charges following investigation into preplanned services,"The owner of multiple funeral homes in Connecticut is facing more charges following an extensive investigation into allegations of fraudulent activity involving preplanned funeral services. Philip Pietras was taken into custody on Tuesday on an active arrest warrant and charged with 20 counts of second-degree larceny and 60 counts of intent to defraud funeral service contracts, according to the Vernon Police Department. The Vernon investigation began in April 2025 and involved interviews with more than 60 victims, police said. Pietras is the owner, president and funeral director at Pietras Family Funeral Homes, which had locations in Vernon, East Windsor, Coventry and Tolland. CT funeral home owner charged after allegedly stealing more than $70,000 in prepayments In April, Connecticut State Police charged Pietras with one count of first-degree larceny by embezzlement. State police investigators arrested Pietras after finding that he allegedly stole more than $70,000 in prepayments from clients. Authorities began investigating Pietras in October 2024 after being contacted by an employee with a company that works with agencies like the state Department of Social Service and the Department of Developmental Services. The employee, who helps assist individuals with physical and cognitive disabilities, told police her employer helps manage the finances and accounts of these clients, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. One specific type of account that they help manage is a prepayment funeral/burial fund, which involves payments that are made to a particular funeral home, the warrant affidavit said. The funeral home then typically deposits these payments into a trust account via an escrow agent, where they accrue interest over time until an individual dies and their funeral services are needed, according to the warrant affidavit. The individual who contacted police said she was assessing client accounts when she noticed a discrepancy involving a payment made to the Pietras Funeral Home's Coventry location, the warrant affidavit said. She told investigators a check had been given to the funeral home and was cleared by the bank, but was allegedly never deposited into the trust account, the warrant affidavit said. When interviewed by police about the alleged fraud in February 2024, Pietas allegedly blamed the discrepancies on the ""age of the accounts, accounting problems, checks getting filed improperly, COVID and the frequency of how checks are received,"" according to the warrant affidavit. He also allegedly said he was working with the DPH to rectify the issue, but the department told police he had not responded to their inquiries, the warrant affidavit said. After his arrest in the spring, Pietras posted a $50,000 bond, court records show. He has not yet entered a plea to the larceny charge. Pietras was arrested again on Sept. 17, his time by the Coventry Police Department, and charged with 22 counts of selling a funeral service contract with intent to defraud, 11 counts of second-degree larceny by embezzlement and one count of second-degree forgery. Coventry police alleged that they able to identify more than 20 victims who collectively lost more than $160,000 over the past decade. CT funeral home owner faces new charges alleging he embezzled over $160K from prepaid contracts The Sept. 17 arrest came after a lengthy investigation involving multiple police department and the Rockville State's Attorney's Office. According to Coventry police, multiple alleged victims reported that they had entered into prepaid funeral contracts with the funeral home's Coventry location and that the contracts were fraudulent. Coventry police said Pietras posted a $150,000 bond following his arrest. On the new charges, Pietras was being held on an $800,000 surety bond and was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Anyone with additional information about the investigation is asked to contact the Vernon Police Department at 860-872-9126.",Hartfort Courant,2025-09-30T20:24:35Z,https://www.courant.com/2025/10/01/owner-of-ct-funeral-homes-facing-more-charges-following-investigation-into-preplanned-services/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.153414,-0.2705882352941177
Millions of households urged to act today over energy bills - Liverpool Echo,"Over seven million households on a standard energy tariff are being urged to submit meter readings to avoid paying higher prices from October 1. The energy price cap is set to rise by 2 per cent from Wednesday for a typical household in England, Scotland and Wales, coinciding with the onset of cooler temperatures and increased central heating use. This means that the annual energy bill for the average household paying by direct debit for gas and electricity will increase from the current £1,720 to £1,755. StepChange debt charity has highlighted that while the £35 per year increase ""seems like a small amount"", new figures reveal a 32 per cent surge in average energy arrears among its clients seeking debt advice over the last two years, reports the Daily Record. Simon Trevethick, head of communications at StepChange, said: ""Not only will people find they are having to switch on their heating now as the weather turns colder, but bills are also set to go up this month, which is another blow to household finances. Energy arrears are the most common type of debt across household bills that we see at StepChange, and people have had little respite from steep costs over the past three years."" ""For anyone who is struggling or worried about energy bills, there is support available out there - contact your supplier, check to see if you're eligible for any grants, and of course you can always get in touch with an organisation like StepChange."" Emily Seymour, Energy editor at Which?, has voiced her concerns about the upcoming energy price cap increase. She said: ""As we head into the colder weather, many households will be concerned that the energy price cap is going up by 2 per cent this week."" She continued: ""There are several deals on the market for lower than the price cap, so now is a good time to shop around if you're looking to fix. As a rule of thumb, we'd recommend looking for deals cheaper than the current price cap, not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees. If you're on a variable tariff, make sure to submit a meter reading to ensure you pay the cheaper rates for any energy used before the new price cap takes effect."" Despite a 2 per cent decrease in wholesale prices over the last three months, energy costs are set to rise. This is largely due to an increase in standing charges - the daily rate consumers pay for energy supply to their homes - which are expected to rise by 4 per cent for electricity and 14 per cent for gas, or 7p a day. This increase is primarily driven by the UK Government's expansion of the Warm Home Discount. The scheme will now include an additional 2.7 million low-income households, including 900,000 families with children, after the removal of the ""hard to heat"" eligibility criteria. The Labour Government estimates that approximately 6.1 million households will benefit from the £150 Warm Home Discount this winter. Ofgem has attributed the latest price hike to an increase in electricity balancing costs, which are incurred by network operators to ensure a stable electricity supply when there is both an excess and a shortage of power in the system. This has added approximately £1.23 per month to the average household bill. The energy regulator adjusts the price cap for households every three months, primarily based on the cost of energy on wholesale markets. Introduced by the Government in January 2019, the energy price cap sets a maximum price that energy suppliers can charge consumers in England, Scotland and Wales for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy they use.",Liverpool Echo,2025-10-01T08:58:28Z,https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/millions-households-urged-act-today-32586033,2025-10-01 17:27:02.153780,0.2784313725490195
Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: BigBear.ai vs. SoundHound AI | The Motley Fool,"However, their fortunes on the stock market have been quite contrasting in 2025. While BigBear.ai's stock price has jumped an impressive 47% as of this writing, SoundHound has lost more than 21% of its value. Let's look at the reasons why one of these AI stocks has made investors richer this year and the other one has struggled. BigBear.ai provides AI software solutions to help improve the decision-making processes of both commercial and government customers. It applies AI and machine learning (ML) tools to clients' data for applications such as predictive analytics, threat detection, facial recognition, and biometrics, among others. Though the company points out that it is present in multiple areas such as defense, intelligence, border security, travel, hospitality, manufacturing, and supply chain, the bulk of its revenue comes from government contracts. The similarity that BigBear.ai's business has to that of Palantir's explains why investors have been buying this stock hand over fist. But then, a closer look will tell us that BigBear.ai's stock price surge isn't justified by its poor financial performance. The company reported an 18% year-over-year decline in its revenue in Q2 to just under $40 million. Management attributed this sharp drop to ""lower volume on certain Army programs,"" which tells us that its reliance on federal contracts for a big chunk of its revenue isn't paying off. Moreover, BigBear.ai's margins shrank, and its losses increased on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, Palantir is enjoying outstanding growth in its business by attracting both commercial and government customers. This clearly suggests that BigBear.ai isn't finding much traction in the fast-growing AI software market. Additionally, the company's revenue backlog indicates that it doesn't have much visibility going forward as well. That's because only a small portion of its backlog is funded. Almost 95% of the $380 million backlog it reported at the end of Q2 is either unfunded or unexercised, which means it will only be recognized as actual revenue if its customers decide to buy its solutions. We have already seen that BigBear.ai struggled last quarter thanks to lower demand from a key government customer, which also forced it to lower its 2025 guidance. In fact, BigBear.ai's top line is set to drop by double-digit percentages this year, suggesting that it may find it difficult to deliver more upside to investors, especially considering that its price-to-sales ratio of 12 is on the expensive side. While Bigbear.ai is finding it difficult to grow its business despite operating in a lucrative market, SoundHound AI isn't facing any such problem. The company's revenue in the second quarter was up by a whopping 217% from the year-ago period to $43 million. The good part is that SoundHound AI's growth trajectory has been picking up in recent quarters. The pick-up in the company's growth isn't surprising, considering that it has been quick to build a solid customer base through its product development moves and acquisitions. SoundHound AI's voice AI solutions are used by customers in the automotive, hospitality, restaurant, financial services, retail, and healthcare industries. What's more, it was sitting on a much bigger potential revenue backlog of $1.2 billion at the end of 2024. The fact that it has been growing at an outstanding pace clearly tells us that it has been successfully converting that massive backlog into revenue. That's also the reason why the company has raised its revenue guidance for 2025. Its top line is on track to double this year to $169 million, which is the midpoint of its guidance range. Another thing worth noting is that SoundHound is growing at a faster pace than the 23% annual growth rate of the conversational AI market, which means it's winning a bigger share of this lucrative space that's expected to generate over $79 billion in annual revenue by 2033. As a result, there is a good chance that SoundHound will be able to sustain its remarkable growth rate in the long run and eventually become a much bigger company. That's why investors would do well to buy it following its slide this year. Of course, the stock is expensive right now at 47 times sales, but that seems justified, considering how fast it is growing and its solid prospects. As such, buying SoundHound AI over BigBear.ai seems like the smart thing to do for anyone looking to choose from one of these two AI stocks right now.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:20:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-bigbearai/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.154221,0.1215686274509804

3 Reasons the Crypto Sector Tumbled Last Week | The Motley Fool,"Think last week's crypto drop came out of nowhere? Here's the timeline and the three main forces behind it. The crypto sector took a collective tumble last week. It wasn't a completely harmonious drop, as stablecoins held firm (as intended) and outliers such as Zcash (ZEC 29.89%) posted big gains. But the overarching crypto trend was unmistakably bearish: Let's take a look at the factors that inspired these crypto price swings last week. Last week's crypto action needs a bit of additional context. The two weeks before this period were pretty bullish thanks to signs of stabilization in the American economy. Encouraged by helpful trends in recent inflation reports and other macroeconomic data points, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time since December 2024. As a result, risk-averse investors such as large financial institutions poured fresh cash into cryptocurrencies and crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Mature cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, for example) posted roughly 5% gains and moved close to their all-time highs; Dogecoin and Solana enjoyed double-digit percentage gains. That crypto-friendly period led up to a wave of profit taking last week. Some of the sales were also forced, as leveraged crypto investors had to settle margin calls on trades financed by borrowed funds. That's a risky business, folks. Investors who prefer spot-priced cryptocurrency ETFs over holding the cryptos directly are usually not big fans of high-risk, high-reward strategies. This on-ramp to the crypto world is available to many accounts that simply can't touch Bitcoin or Ethereum directly -- large-scale institutional investors, personal retirement plans, and risk-dodging people who prefer an extra layer of regulatory protection. It's not surprising to see these groups take profits too, especially when the price peak was largely motivated by political and regulatory moves. ETF owners can't make trades over the weekend, though. Therefore, the direct cryptocurrency drawdown on Sunday, Sept. 21, translated into a modest outflow of ETF funds on Monday, Sept. 22. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT 0.05%) saw a $38 million outflow that day, while the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA -0.60%) lost $15 million of customer funds. These figures aren't huge, but that's still a sharp trend reversal from steady inflows in recent weeks. And then there's the wonkish elephant in the room. On Thursday, Sept. 25, more political pressure was piled on cryptocurrencies (and other investment markets). Congress threatened to close down government operations on Oct. 1, the Trump administration pledged to take military action in Gaza, and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issued a stern warning that ""there is no risk-free path"" to a healthy economy. That's the big dip you saw in the chart earlier. Crypto investors took Powell's warning seriously, and a $200 million outflow from the iShares Ethereum Trust made the earlier retreat look forgettable. That's a bitter brew of profit taking and politics. I should point out that all five cryptocurrencies in the chart are up by at least 34% over the last year, more than doubling the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.41%) stock market index's 15.5% gain over the same period. Hence, crypto bears can still argue that the market remains overheated, while the bulls can treat this price dip as a buying opportunity. Either way, the events of last week probably didn't move many investors from one side to the other in that eternal clash.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:17:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-reasons-the-crypto-sector-tumbled-last-week/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.155103,0.3098039215686275
Cardano Vs Remittix: Which Of These Could Produce Up To 20x ROI In Q4,"As excitement builds toward Q4, many investors ask whether Cardano still has room for explosive gains. Could Cardano deliver 20x returns in a few months? Into that debate comes Remittix (RTX), now frequently tipped as a high-multiplying crypto pick. This article compares Cardano's current strength and limits with Remittix's emerging narrative to see which one might realistically hit up to 20x in Q4. The contrast between a mature Layer 1 and a rewards-driven utility play provides a clearer view of upside potential. Cardano (ADA) carries credibility from its long history, academic backing and methodical development approach. Its price recently tested the $0.75 support zone, with analysts suggesting that if it holds, a rebound toward $1.20 or even $2.00 may occur. Still, achieving 20x in a single quarter is a steep climb. ADA's market cap is already large, making room for parabolic moves more limited. Its recent upgrades (Hydra, modular enhancements) are promising but require adoption and tooling before turning into multiplier gains. When comparing Remittix to Cardano in Q4 potential, the gap in risk and reward is stark. Cardano's strength lies in its legacy and network effect. Remittix is built around reward engineering, incentive mechanics, and adoption velocity. In that sense, Remittix may offer a clearer path to 20x if its utility and traction accelerate. On metrics, Remittix has sold over 673 million tokens, trades at $0.1130 and has raised over $26.8 million. It passed critical funding thresholds of $20M and $22M to secure two CEX listings and is preparing for a third listing. Remittix is now VERIFIED by CertiK and currently holds the #1 ranking on CertiK's list for Pre-Launch Tokens. Its wallet is in beta testing, with community users actively testing transfers, UX flows and network integrations. The 15% USDT reward system is live, enabling users to claim USDT every 24 hours via the Remittix dashboard. Here are five core strengths that could fuel its 20x trajectory: Cardano offers stability, credibility and gradual upside, but 20x seems an extreme stretch within a few months, given its size and current momentum. Remittix, by contrast, combines incentives, early traction and listing momentum in a way built to accelerate. If everything aligns, reward adoption, listing catalysts and network usage, Remittix has a far clearer path to 20x returns. For the bold investor chasing upside, Remittix may justify inclusion alongside Cardano as a balanced growth play.

"Removing Corrupt Petroleum Subsidy Was A Tough, But Necessary Decision - President Tinubu Opens Up","President Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday, admitted that it was not an easy decision to end the controversial fuel subsidy regime in Nigeria. He, however, added that it was a necessary and timely decision needed to save Nigeria's economy from total collapse. Naija News reports that President Tinubu made the acknowledgement during his nationwide broadcast to Nigerians on the occasion of the country's 65th Independence Anniversary celebration. It would be recalled that President Tinubu, on May 29, 2023, right from the venue of his inauguration, declared an end to the fuel subsidy regime, prompting an immediate rise in the price of petrol, heightened inflation and other economic pressures. Addressing the issue during his speech on Wednesday, Tinubu stated that the fuel subsidy regime was a corrupt system that needed to be abolished. He added that since the removal of fuel subsidy, the accruing financial resources have been deployed to other areas of development in the country. ""As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform. We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. ""In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our commonwealth,"" he said. The President explained that the money saved from subsidy removal was channelled to other key areas, education, healthcare, security, agriculture, and infrastructure, areas he said would improve the lives of Nigerians. ""Following the removal of the corrupt petroleum subsidy, we have freed up trillions of Naira for targeted investment in the real economy and social programmes for the most vulnerable, as well as all tiers of government. ""I have always candidly acknowledged that these reforms have come with some temporary pains. However, the alternative of allowing our country to descend into economic chaos or bankruptcy was not an option. Our macro-economic progress has proven that our sacrifices have not been in vain. Together, we are laying a new foundation cast in concrete, not on quicksand,"" he said. Tinubu boasted that the tough choices made by his administration have resulted in the availability of more resources for the government at all levels to care for the people and cater to developmental projects. ""As a result of the tough decisions we made, the Federal and State governments, including Local Governments, now have more resources to take care of the people at the lower level of the ladder, to address our development challenges,"" the president noted.",Naija News,2025-10-01T09:00:35Z,https://www.naijanews.com/2025/10/01/removing-corrupt-petroleum-subsidy-was-a-tough-but-necessary-decision-president-tinubu-opens-up/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.156771,0.08235294117647052

Etsy and Shopify Cozy Up With OpenAI's ChatGPT: What You Need to Know | The Motley Fool,"A new ChatGPT checkout could push more shopping into AI conversations -- and both commerce platforms want in. E-commerce just took a step further into artificial intelligence (AI). On Monday, OpenAI announced that U.S. users can now buy from U.S. Etsy (ETSY -10.70%) sellers directly inside ChatGPT, with support for more than one million Shopify (SHOP -0.22%) merchants ""coming soon."" The experience -- called Instant Checkout -- keeps shoppers in the conversation from discovery to payment and was co-developed with Stripe. For investors, any AI headline these days is flashy -- and likely to cause moves in share prices. Indeed, Etsy stock soared almost 16% on Monday in the wake of this news. And Shopify shares jumped more than 6%. The real question, however, is whether this changes traffic patterns and conversion enough to matter for Etsy and Shopify over the long haul. Etsy operates a two-sided marketplace known for handmade, vintage, and unique goods. Shopify provides commerce infrastructure for businesses of all sizes across online and offline channels. Both already benefit when product discovery happens off their platforms (social, search, influencers). Generative AI chats becoming a transactional channel is the next logical extension. OpenAI says product search results with Instant Checkout in ChatGPT are organic, ranked purely on relevance (not any sort of sponsored placement), and can now be purchased simply by users tapping ""Buy"" within their chat threads. Orders are still fulfilled by the merchant; ChatGPT simply passes information securely via the new Agentic Commerce Protocol. That matters because it keeps merchant branding and relationships intact while potentially capturing impulse purchases that start as conversations about gift ideas or prompts like, ""Show me ideas under $100."" Importantly, ChatGPT is no small partner. OpenAI says it has over 700 million people who already ""turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love."" Instant Checkout is live first for U.S. Etsy sellers. This builds on the company's recent efforts to integrate ""emergent AI technologies,"" as CEO Josh Silverman said in the company's second-quarter update. This, combined with efforts to make its shopping experience more browsable and personalized, is ""creating a significant runway for growth, as well as an opportunity to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders by capitalizing on what makes Etsy special,"" he added. The catalyst comes at a good time for Etsy, because it has been struggling. Etsy's gross merchandise sales (GMS) in Q2 fell 4.8% year over year to $2.8 billion. Notably, however, revenue for the quarter did grow 3.8% to $672.7 million as the company leaned on ads and payments, lifting its take rate to 24%. If ChatGPT-driven discovery can reactivate lapsed buyers or lift conversion on gift-centric searches, investors should see it first in GMS stabilization and active-buyer trends. While Etsy goes first, Shopify's upcoming inclusion may be an even bigger unlock. Shopify's merchant scale (its second-quarter GMS was $87.8 billion, dwarfing Etsy's) gives this feature real distribution. But investors will have to watch to see whether Instant Checkout is incremental to existing channels and doesn't simply shift orders from merchants' own sites. Odds are, however, that a meaningful portion of these orders will be incremental. Shopify's VP of Product Vanessa Lee said in a press release about the upcoming integration that it will let merchants ""show up naturally"" inside AI conversations with no links or redirects, giving shoppers ""a way to buy without breaking their flow."" Unlike Etsy, the integration comes at a time of strength for Shopify. Its second-quarter revenue rose 31% year over year to $2.68 billion, and GMV rose by the same amount. Management framed results as the payoff from ""bold bets we made years ago."" As exciting as the announcement is for Etsy and Shopify, investors should keep their expectations in check. First, Instant Checkout only supports single-item purchases today, with multi-item carts to follow. Second, OpenAI says rankings are unsponsored; that's good for trust and the user experience but means sales volumes will depend on user behavior, not paid placement. Finally, remember that OpenAI states merchants will pay a ""small fee"" on completed transactions, so it will be interesting to see how the economics unfold over time. After a sharp pop on the news for both stocks, investors shouldn't be treating this as an automatic buy signal. But if evidence builds over time that chat-commerce funnels new, incremental demand at healthy conversions, and that merchant adoption stays high despite fees, then this could be a big deal. Investors should keep an eye on the integration over time to see how it impacts both e-commerce businesses.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:16:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/etsy-and-shopify-cozy-up-with-openais-chatgpt-what/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.157566,0.1450980392156862
"Facing no income for 6 months, these construction workers might have to abandon their Canadian dreams | CBC News","A construction company in Dartmouth is desperate to find help for three employees from the Philippines who may have to leave Canada because of a mistake in their applications to renew work permits. In two cases, Brycon Construction forgot to pay a $230 employer fee as part of the application. In the third, it neglected to submit a labour market impact assessment. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) rejected the renewals and told the men they had to stop working immediately, leaving them with the option to either restart their entire application from scratch or depart the country in 90 days. ""I thought, oh my God, is this really happening?"" said Dave Hiscock, the operations manager at Brycon Construction. He said he can't understand why the department didn't flag that a small detail of the application was missing. ""It's an awful penalty for whether a fee wasn't paid or a piece of paper wasn't put in. You're uprooting three-plus lives,"" said Hiscock. ""These people have done nothing wrong while they've been in Canada. They've paid their taxes. They're good working staff."" In a statement, IRCC told CBC that the onus is on the workers to make sure their applications are complete. If they believe there was an error made in the decision, they can appeal. Otherwise, they have to reapply. On average, it takes about 180 days, or six months, to consider a new application. During that time, the men cannot work and their provincial health card is made invalid. Brycon Construction just began work on the Highway 103 twinning project between Hubbards and Chester on the province's South Shore. The men -- Jafferson Palabasan, Raddy Adams Manicadao and Rene Logrinio -- are vital to the project, said Hiscock, who called his local member of Parliament but was told nothing could be done to expedite the process. The rejections came as a shock for the three men, who arrived at the same time in 2022. All have applied to become permanent residents, hoping to stay here and bring their families to Halifax. Now, they don't know how they'll afford food. ""It's a dream city to me. It's a better future to my daughter,"" said Palabasan, who has been waiting for approval to move his wife and six-year-old daughter out of the Philippines. ""Seeing them struggling, it's doubling the hardship I'm experiencing now."" Logrinio sends money home to support his wife and three daughters. He doesn't know if he can afford to wait out the new six-month process. ""Without a job or income, I cannot survive here,"" he said. Adams Manicadao said his savings are almost gone and he can no longer pay for his wife's insulin to manage her diabetes. The situation is becoming more and more common, said Elizabeth Wozniak, an immigration lawyer based in Halifax. She said years ago, immigration officers could use their discretion to flag a missing piece of an application that could be fixed within minutes. Now, she said, the work permits are rejected outright. ""When it doesn't work, it goes really, really badly really fast, and the consequences are huge,"" she said. ""It's a bit of a minefield when you're applying for extension applications."" In the meantime, it's next to impossible for Brycon to hire local staff or contract out the work, Hiscock said. When he books six job interviews, he's lucky if one applicant shows up, he said. ""There's a lot of days of pulling hair and wondering where are we going to find people to get the work done,"" he said. Brycon now employs 18 international workers among a staff of 120. All of them are hoping to stay with the company long term and become permanent residents in Canada, Hiscock said. The operations manager said he's learned a terrible lesson, and is advising other companies to learn from the mistake. In the future, Brycon will use immigration consultants to make sure the applications for his international employees are done correctly, he said. ""This will never happen again under my watch, never. Lesson learned.""",CBC News,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/facing-no-income-for-6-months-these-construction-workers-might-have-to-abandon-their-canadian-dreams-1.7646294,2025-10-01 17:27:02.157959,-0.2
Legacy Gold Provides Exploration Update on Baner Gold Mine Property in Central Idaho,"Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Legacy Gold Mines Ltd. (TSXV: LEGY) (the ""Company"", ""Legacy"" or ""Legacy Gold"") has been carrying out its drilling and surface sampling exploration programs on the Baner gold mine property in central Idaho, USA (the ""Baner Gold Mine Property"") over the last 12 months pursuant to a 3 year property option it has with Champion Electric Metals Inc. In its news release dated August 21, 2025, Legacy announced commencement of its first drilling program on the previously drilled Main Zone in the center of the Baner Gold Mine Property. Assay results from the first holes drilled are expected in mid-to-late October. The Baner Gold Mine Property sits within the historic Orogrande Gold Mining District that has hosted numerous historic gold mines since Idaho's first gold rush in the late 1800's. Legacy's 2025 drilling is testing for the continuity of high grade and wide low grade zones of gold mineralization in a flatter dip interpretation along the 1 km section of the Orogrande shear structure within the Main Zone. Legacy's 2025 soil sampling program that took place included an area northwest of the Main Zone confirming its prospectivity and accordingly is expected to be drilled in the current drill program. ""The support Legacy Gold has received from its drilling and exploration partners in its first year operating in Idaho has been excellent,"" said Brian Hinchcliffe. ""The results of the surface sampling in the northwest of the Baner Gold Mine Property has caused Legacy to re-direct drilling targets as we received all necessary permitting adjustments very promptly."" The drill program underway has primarily targeted the Main Zone in areas with results produced from previous drilling by Champion Electric that included 20.8 grams per tonne gold (""g/t Au"") over 12.0 metres (""m"") and 8.7 g/t Au over 6.3 m, along with 27 intersections that are greater than 10.0 m, and that average 18.6 m (at 1.16 g/t Au) in the 21 drill holes in the Main and NW zones. Legacy's 2025 drilling has followed up on this previous drilling, but assumes that greater potential width to the mineralized zones can be captured by angling the drill hole direction differently. Hence the goal of the drilling program is to prove the flatter interpreted dip, extend the strike length and expand zones of mineralization within the Main Zone. Highlights of the 2025 Soil Sampling Program 174 samples returned values of >10ppb and 2 samples returned values of >1,000 ppb.Three significant target areas identified with high soils in these areas of 1.25 gram per tonne gold (""g/t"", ""Au""), 1.7 g/t Au, and 1.03 g/t Au.Historical soils combined with the new soils show multiple anomalies with good widths and very good horizontal extents that overlap the locations of interpreted, as well as known fault structures, and geophysical anomalies (magnetic highs and Induced Polarization conductors).Work to date suggests the potential for a prospective and extensively mineralized system that remains open along strike, up-dip, and at depth, along with other un-drilled large anomalies - all of which warrant additional follow-up. 2025 Soil Sampling Program The Baner Gold Mine Property contains an interpreted textbook shear system which is a common feature at producing gold mines world-wide. There are two major fault structures (the Orogrande Fault and the Orogrande West Fault) that act as conduits for fluids carrying gold, as well as at least two other structures (vein systems) that are crossovers between them. Legacy Gold completed a surface soil sampling program aimed at tightening the grid spacing on previous sampling, sampling areas with no previous information, and targeting the gold bearing structures. Results have refined existing targets and uncovered numerous additional targets for future drilling. A total of 841 samples were taken, with 174 samples above 10 ppb Au and 2 samples above 1,000 ppb Au. Three target areas identified are especially significant. In the southwest portion of the property (""Baner SW""), a large north-south soil anomaly is present on both sides of a known fault structure in an area of strong magnetic features. The highest soil in this area is 1.25 g/t Au. It is at least 2.2 km long and 550 m wide which is larger than the soil anomaly at the Main Zone (1.6 km long). In the north-central part of the property, a strong 1.7 km long soil anomaly exists at the top of the hill (suggesting that the soils could not have come from anywhere else or be contaminated by water flow). This anomaly coincides with similar magnetic highs as the Main Zone and coincides with geophysical conductors reaching in that direction. The highest soil in this area is 1.03 g/t Au. In the northwest part of the property, there are two 700 m long anomalies that are along the same fault as Baner SW. The soils completed by previous operators combined with the new soils show multiple anomalies with good widths and very good horizontal extents that overlap the locations of interpreted and known fault structures which are the conduits for gold fluids. The pattern is the same for a textbook shear system where geophysical anomalies corroborate these locations. These suggest the potential for a prospective and extensively mineralized system that remains open long strike, up-dip, and at depth, along with other un-drilled large anomalies, which warrant additional follow-up. Soil sampling is undertaken in some areas of the world where gold from underlying gold mineralization frequently show up in the ""B"" horizon of soils just below the roots of plants, as is the case with the Baner Gold Mine Property. Soil assays above 10 ppb indicate areas of interest that are considered anomalous. For scale, the >1.0 g/t soil assays received equate to 1,000 ppb (i.e. extremely anomalous). High soils don't always result in high grade drill intersections below them, however, they give a good indication of mineralization opportunity and provide additional confidence in targets before drilling. Surface soil samples is one of the cheapest exploration methods available.

Business News | European Flour Fuels India's Growing Pizza Passion | LatestLY,"European flour helps create dough that is light yet sturdy, airy yet crisp, and always authentic New Delhi [India], October 1: Few foods have managed to capture the Indian imagination quite like pizza. Once considered a novelty reserved for five-star hotels and international chains, pizza today has become a true household favourite. From roadside stalls in Ahmedabad serving spicy fusion slices, to artisanal wood-fired ovens in Goa, and gourmet pizzerias in Mumbai and Delhi--the love for pizza spans every corner of the country. Its adaptability is what makes it so popular: it can be indulgent or light, vegetarian or meaty, traditional or adventurous. Whether shared at festive gatherings, enjoyed during family movie nights, or ordered late into the night by college students, pizza has become a part of India's modern food story. Also Read | Realme 15x 5G Price, Specifications and Features Revealed, Know Everything About Newly Launched Realme Mid-Range Smartphone in India. At the heart of this global phenomenon lies a simple truth: great pizza begins with great flour. The crust is the foundation, the canvas on which all toppings and flavours come alive. And increasingly, Indian chefs, bakers, and discerning home cooks are reaching for European soft wheat flour, the same flour trusted for centuries in the birthplace of pizza--Italy. Known for its purity, elasticity, and consistency, European flour helps create dough that is light yet sturdy, airy yet crisp, and always authentic. More than just an ingredient, it brings with it a heritage of milling expertise, strict EU quality standards, and a reputation for excellence that sets it apart from local atta or maida. In short, it is the ingredient that transforms a pizza from ordinary to extraordinary. Why Indian Pizza Makers Choose European Flour Also Read | RBI MPC Meeting: Reserve Bank of India Announces New Measures To Internationalise Rupee. * Elasticity & Strength - essential for achieving the airy yet chewy crust of authentic Italian-style pizza* Consistent Performance - dough that handles perfectly in both wood-fired ovens and modern kitchen ovens* Strict EU Safety & Purity Standards - guaranteed quality and trust in every batch* Centuries of Milling Expertise - the heritage of Italian pizzaiolos brought straight to Indian kitchens Classic Neapolitan PizzaA harmonious blend of tradition and technique, this recipe honours the simple elegance of Naples. Ingredients: * 1.6 kg type ""00"" flour* 1 litre water* 50g salt (added after combining flour and yeast)* Yeast: 3g fresh brewer's yeast or 1g dried yeast The ""Three Commandments"" of Neapolitan Dough: Only four ingredients: flour, water, salt, yeast.Proof for no less than 12-14 hours (or longer for better digestion), at a controlled temperature of 15-20°C with 70-80% humidity.Bake exclusively in a wood-fired oven. After the first fermentation (~4 hours), divide the dough into 10 portions (~250 g each), enough to make a 30 cm pizza each. Then proof for at least another 8 hours--this slow maturation allows complex flour sugars to break down, enriching flavour and improving digestibility. Method Highlights: * Handle the dough gently--stretch from the centre outwards, keeping the centre thin (a few millimetres), while allowing the cornicione (crust) to stay airy and around 2 cm high.* Bake in a blazing wood-fired oven (~450 °C) for just 60-90 seconds for that signature char and melt. The outcome is the iconic Neapolitan pizza--a light, elastic crust with a tender, airy interior and a beautifully blistered cornicione. Each bite balances chew and crispness, delivering authentic flavour that transports you straight to Naples. Simple, digestible, and deeply satisfying, it's pizza in its purest and most celebrated form. Impact of the ""Pure Flour from Europe"" Campaign Launched in 2021 and now set for renewed outreach in 2025, the campaign is actively educating Indian chefs, bakers, importers, and media on the excellence of EU soft wheat flour. From product demonstrations to recipe development and awareness initiatives, it has played a crucial role in building recognition for Italian flour among Indian professionals and consumers alike. The steady rise in imports and the shift from generic or re-branded options to certified Italian products--highlights a broader transformation: India's food sector is evolving toward premium, health-focused, and origin-assured ingredients. Italian flour, with its combination of tradition, safety, and versatility, is well-positioned to meet that demand. As part of its relaunch in India, the ""Pure Flour from Europe"" campaign will be participating in AAHAR- The International Food & Hospitality Fair, taking place in March 2026 at the Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. The event will provide a platform to reconnect with the food trade, showcase the superior quality and versatility of European flour, and engage directly with chefs, bakers, importers, and food professionals across India.

"Lead with safety: how decision-makers can inspire a culture of protection, not just compliance","In high‑risk industrial settings, safety forms the backbone of every successful operation. It supports productivity, quality, and trust - and without it, the rest quickly unravels. Yet too often, safety is viewed only as a compliance exercise: a series of tick boxes, reports, and audits that satisfy regulators but fail to truly protect workers. For safety managers and site leaders, there's a growing opportunity - and responsibility - to change that mindset. By leading with safety as a core value rather than a regulatory requirement, leaders can build a culture that inspires trust, boosts morale, and empowers teams to take ownership of their own protection. × Expand Credit: MSA Safety 514269723 Chemical & Petrochemical plant abstract at night. Beyond the compliance mindset Compliance is the baseline. Regulations exist to keep people safe, but when safety is reduced to minimum standards, the human factor can get lost. Workers begin to see PPE and safety protocols as obligations rather than tools to protect their lives. When safety is treated as a checklist exercise, workers may become complacent, going through the motions without truly engaging in safe behaviours. If PPE is uncomfortable or restrictive, some may look for ways around wearing it properly. Over time, this can erode trust, especially if employees feel safety measures are imposed without their input. True safety leadership reframes protection as personal investment in every team member's wellbeing, not just a legal obligation. PPE choices that define leadership Safety managers and site leaders set the tone for workplace culture, and every decision, from the policies you create to the PPE you choose, signals your true priorities. A compliance‑focused leader might ask, ""Does this meet the standard?"" A safety‑focused leader asks, ""Will this protect my people in the scenarios they may face?"" Few decisions make those values more visible than the choice of PPE. Selecting protection that is comfortable, high‑performing, and easy to integrate into daily tasks shows you're investing in more than compliance, you're investing in your people. The appropriate PPE should be lightweight and ergonomic, meet or exceed safety standards, and work seamlessly with other equipment so it's easy for workers to adopt and trust. Choosing it with care sends a clear message: We value your safety and will equip you with the appropriate protective equipment. Building trust through involvement A genuine safety culture takes shape where the work happens. It's influenced by leadership, but forged through the daily actions, decisions, and interactions of the people on site. Involving employees in PPE decisions can transform how they view safety equipment. Involving workers in PPE selection builds trust and ensures the chosen equipment works in real-world conditions. Give teams the chance to trial new products before procurement, provide feedback on comfort, fit, and usability, and share practical insights from the field that may not surface in a purchasing meeting. This collaboration not only improves PPE selection but also shows respect for workers' expertise and increases the likelihood of consistent, correct use. People are more likely to use and advocate for equipment they've helped choose. Leadership sets the tone for safety As a safety manager or site leader, your influence goes far beyond compliance checklists. You are the visible embodiment of your organisation's commitment to protection. When leaders consistently wear PPE, follow protocols, and speak openly about safety, those behaviours are far more likely to be mirrored across the workforce. Conversely, when corners are cut, even occasionally, it undermines every safety message. Embedding safety into the fabric of everyday work life starts with visible, consistent leadership. It means making safety a core value in meetings, training, and updates; recognising workers' safe behaviours publicly and often; and closing the feedback loop so employees see how their input drives change. It also means investing in trusted PPE, providing ongoing training, and making sure equipment meets operational needs. This daily commitment not only builds credibility and trust but also leads to tangible benefits: higher morale, fewer incidents, stronger retention, and a reputation for genuinely valuing worker wellbeing. Lead with protection, not just policy, and safety will follow. At MSA, we share your commitment to safety, and design PPE that fits, functions, and protects.

Woman buys £4.99 mystery bag from Morrisons and is gobsmacked by contents - Manchester Evening News,"Buying mystery items is all the rage at the moment. From Too Good To Go food bags to Labubu blind boxes, we're all just a little bit obsessed with not really knowing what we're getting. Sometimes, we're over the moon with what we find, but other times, shoppers can be left feeling a little disappointed. But Maia Allen was far from gutted when she opened her Morrisons Too Good To Go bag. Maia received a ""mountain"" of food so large that she struggled to carry it back home, and she was thrilled to realise that it was worth almost eight times the £4.99 she paid for it. The Londoner was stunned when staff handed her the stash, which included fresh items such as mangos, grapes, apples, plums, bananas, pomegranate, mixed peppers and more. What the 25-year-old expected to be a modest mystery bag turned into a bumper food haul that filled her fridge and cupboards. She said she had enough fruits and veggies to keep her going for over a week. Not bad for less than a fiver! Maia said that she was ""beyond happy"" with the bag, and it came at a good time as she's ""currently on a health kick"" so it was ""perfect"" for what she wanted at the moment. She said: ""I used the food across dinners and lunches for the next week and a half, made smoothies, and even froze some of the fruit. ""I was genuinely shocked at how much I got. ""The lady who gave it to me was lovely and joked, 'I hope you can carry this!' which made me laugh since I'd just come from the gym and was in full gym gear trying to carry home a mountain of fruit and veg"". The bag also came with several ready-to-cook medleys, such as an edamame and broccoli stir-fry and herby baby potatoes, which were perfect accompaniments for the meals she made. Had Maia bought the same items individually in the store, the haul would have cost around £35 to £40, meaning that she got an absolute steal. The Too Good To Go bag is rivalled only by a Wasabi sushi bag that she picked up a few years ago. She added: ""The best Too Good To Go I've ever had was a sushi bag from Wasabi a few years ago. Sushi is my favourite cuisine. ""I received so much in that bag and still think about it! I usually get at least one bag a month. ""Lately, I've been going more for supermarket ones instead of bakery or takeaway bags, as they last longer and encourage me to try new things. ""The food lasted really well - some bits I froze, but I managed to eat everything in the end"".",Manchester Evening News,2025-10-01T09:02:03Z,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/woman-buys-499-mystery-bag-32585992,2025-10-01 17:27:02.160115,0.0117647058823529
Social Security Benefits Get a COLA in 2026. Here's the Best and Worst Scenario for Retirees. | The Motley Fool,"Even in the best-case scenario, retired workers may be disappointed with Social Security's 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The Social Security Administration will announce the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 on the October 15, shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its September inflation report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Surveys conducted by The Motley Fool show most retirees found Social Security's COLAs insufficient in 2024 and 2025, meaning the additional income did not completely offset rising prices. The same outcome is likely next year due to a significant increase in Medicare Part B premiums and tariffs imposed by President Trump. Here's the best-case and worst-case scenario for 2026 COLA. Annual cost-of-living adjustments are designed to protect the purchasing power of Social Security benefits from inflation. You can think of COLAs as yearly pay increases tied to a subset of the Consumer Price Index known as the CPI-W. That metric tracks how prices change across over 200 items weighted based on spending habits of hourly workers. The math is explained below: The Social Security Administration will mail COLA notices in December. They will explain your updated benefit, any deductions like Medicare premiums and tax withholdings, and your net payment amount. Alternatively, you can view your updated benefit through the my Social Security portal. The pay increase takes effect in January. The Social Security Board of Trustees in a report published earlier this year outlined three possibilities for the 2026 COLA: The high estimate says benefits will increase 3%, the low estimate says 2.4%, and the middle estimate says 2.7%. Here's what those figures mean for different beneficiaries: Importantly, Medicare Part B premiums are usually deducted from Social Security benefits and the standard premium is forecast to increase $21.50 to $206.50 per month next year, according to the Medicare Board of Trustees. That would be the largest increase in nominal dollars since 2022, and more than double the $10.30 increase in 2025. Unfortunately, retired workers may once again feel like their cost-of-living adjustment was insufficient next year. Not only because Medicare Part B premium are expected to increase significantly, but also because many economists expect inflation to worsen in the months ahead as companies pass along a larger percentage of President Trump's tariffs. Indeed, BNP Paribas economists estimate U.S. companies have absorbed about 64% of tariffs to date, while foreign exporters have shouldered 20% and U.S. consumers have paid 17%. But those economists expect companies to pass along 63% of the cost increases in the coming months, which could have a material impact on inflation.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:15:00Z,https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/10/01/social-security-benefits-get-cola-2026-best-worst/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.160375,0.1529411764705881
SILVER BULL PROVIDES UPDATE ON ITS ARBITRATION CASE AGAINST MEXICO,"OTCQB: SVBL, TSX: SVB VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 1, 2025 /CNW/ - Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (""Silver Bull"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that the hearing for its Arbitration case against the United States of Mexico (""Mexico"") will commence on October 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C., and will conclude no later than October 11, 2025. As reported in Silver Bull's June 29, 2023 news release, the Company commenced international arbitration proceedings against Mexico under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA"") and the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""). The arbitration has been initiated under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States process, which falls under the auspices of the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (""ICSID""), to which Mexico is a signatory. The arbitration arises from Mexico's refusal to take action with respect to the illegal blockade of Silver Bull's Sierra Mojada Project, which commenced in September 2019 and remains ongoing. Silver Bull is represented in these proceedings by Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (""BSF""), a leading international law firm with extensive experience in investor-state arbitration and is financially supported by Bench Walk Advisors LLC via a Litigation Funding Agreement for up to US$9.5 million to finance the case and the running of the Company. The Management of Silver Bull is confident in its legal position and looks forward to presenting its case at the upcoming hearing in Washington, D.C. On completion of the hearing, it is customary for an Arbitration Tribunal to deliver its findings within approximately six months following the hearing, although this timing may vary. BACKGROUND TO THE CLAIM: Silver Bull officially notified Mexico on March 2, 2023 of its intention to initiate an arbitration owing to Mexico's breaches of NAFTA by unlawfully expropriating Silver Bull's investments without compensation, failing to provide Silver Bull and its investments with fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security, and not upholding NAFTA's national treatment standard. Silver Bull held a meeting with Mexican government officials in Mexico City on May 30, 2023, in an attempt to explore amicable settlement options and avoid arbitration. However, the 90-day period for amicable settlement under NAFTA expired on June 2, 2023, without a resolution. Despite repeated demands and requests for action by the Company, Mexico's governmental agencies have allowed the unlawful blockade to continue to this day, thereby failing to protect Silver Bull's investment. THE SIERRA MOJADA DEPOSIT: Silver Bull's only asset is the Sierra Mojada deposit located in Coahuila, Mexico. Sierra Mojada is an open pittable oxide deposit with a NI 43-101 compliant Measured and Indicated ""global"" Mineral Resource of 70.4 million tonnes grading 3.4% zinc and 38.6 g/t silver for 5.35 billion pounds of contained zinc and 87.4 million ounces of contained silver. Included within the ""global"" Mineral Resource is a Measured and Indicated ""high grade zinc zone"" of 13.5 million tonnes with an average grade of 11.2% zinc at a 6% cutoff, for 3.336 billion pounds of contained zinc, and a Measured and Indicated ""high grade silver zone"" of 15.2 million tonnes with an average grade of 114.9 g/t silver at a 50 g/t cutoff for 56.3 million contained ounces of silver.

53. Crunch - TechRound,"Crunch is an online accounting platform for freelancers, contractors, and small businesses who would rather be running their business than wrestling with numbers. Our clever software does the heavy lifting, and our friendly accountants are always just a message or call away. We make tax, invoicing, and bookkeeping simple, so you can spend less time stressing and more time doing what makes you happy. In 2007, Darren Fell hit a wall with traditional accounting. Endless spreadsheets, hidden fees, and confusing advice left him frustrated. He decided enough was enough. The idea behind Crunch was simple: software that just works, prices that are fair, and real accountants who actually answer your questions without jargon. Trust was the biggest hurdle in the early days. Could business owners really put their financial lives in the hands of an online service? We proved they could by making accountants fully accessible, building bulletproof security, creating software anyone could use, and focusing on support that felt genuinely human. Another challenge was scale. Many SaaS companies lose the personal touch as they grow.

"Saudi budget deficit forecast more than doubles with less revenue, higher spending |  | AW","A view of the King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia said Tuesday it would run a budget deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP this year, more than double the previous forecast, with oil revenues falling and higher-than-expected spending. The deficit is forecast to remain high in 2026 at 3.3 percent of GDP, or 165 billion riyals ($44 billion). The finance ministry, which had previously forecast a 2025 deficit of just 2.3 percent of GDP, forecast expenditures of 1.3 trillion riyals and revenues of 1.15 trillion. It predicted GDP growth of 4.4 percent this year, driven by a five percent increase in ""non-oil activities"", and of 4.6 percent next year. The Arab world's largest economy is engaged in a major drive to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil revenues, with a focus on business and tourism. That includes mega-projects such as Neom, a futuristic desert metropolis. Those efforts come at a significant financial cost at a time when the finance ministry expects a decline of 13.4 percent in state revenues. That is driven in large part by recent falls in oil prices, which had spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter and a cornerstone of the Saudi economy, has experienced a decline in its profits over ten consecutive quarters since achieving record results at the end of 2022. Its profits fell 4.6 percent on a yearly basis in the first quarter of the year, and by 22 percent in the second quarter. The ministry expects Saudi Arabia's deficit to persist in 2027 and 2028, though shrinking to 2.3 percent and then 2.2 percent of GDP.",AW,2025-10-01T08:55:05Z,https://thearabweekly.com/saudi-budget-deficit-forecast-more-doubles-less-revenue-higher-spending,2025-10-01 17:27:02.161521,0.03529411764705892

Motorists warned against use of improvised plates,"The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has advised motorists that the use of improvised and temporary plates will be prohibited starting November 1, 2025. LTO Chief Vigor D. Mendoza II said ""there is no more justification in the use of either the improvised or temporary plates since there is no more backlog of license plates for both four-wheel cars and motorcycles."" ""Kaya sa hindi pa nakukuha ang kanilang mga plaka, we advise them to do so in order to avoid any inconvenience with regard to the strict implementation of this policy. Let us take advantage of the entire month of October to do so,"" said Mendoza. Once the policy is implemented, Mendoza said LTO enforcers and deputized personnel will be advised to apprehend drivers violating the Joint Administrative Order 2014-001 and other regulations. The penalties under the JAO 2014-001 are P5,000 fine and confiscation of the temporary and improvised plates. The LTO official added that motor vehicles with improvised or temporary plates will not be accepted for renewal of registration. Mendoza, however, clarified that ""the use of improvised plates will only be allowed provided that an authorization to use them shall be signed by concerned LTO offices that processed the duplicate plate request."" The improvised plate shall contain the assigned plate number of the vehicle with the words ""Improvised Plate"" below it, he added. Mendoza said the policy against the use of improvised and temporary plates is reinforced by ""aggressive efforts"" to distribute all license plates nationwide as soon as possible. He added that the policy will also be supported with the LTO's existing program of making sure that both the OR/CR and license plates must be available on the day of the release of newly-bought vehicles.",Sun.Star Network Online,2025-10-01T08:59:57Z,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/motorists-warned-against-use-of-improvised-plates,2025-10-01 17:27:02.162676,-0.1294117647058823

HC upholds life sentence of techie for brutal murder of ex-girlfriend in 2008,"Mumbai, Oct 1 (PTI) The Bombay High Court has upheld the conviction and life sentence imposed on a software engineer for the ""brutal"" murder of his former girlfriend and colleague in Pune in 2008. In its judgment of September 26, a copy of which was made available on Wednesday, a bench of Justices Girish Kulkarni and Advait Sethna said the case was a brutal homicidal death of a young woman driven by extreme hatred, jealousy and vengeance. The court dismissed the appeal filed by the techie Mohinder Madhuresh, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, challenging the December 2016 order of a sessions court convicting him of murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment. ""This is an unfortunate case where ordinary human conduct of a sensible and rational behaviour is subjugated by emotions of hostility and cruelty, reducing a human being to inhuman and demonic tendencies, leading to the commission of a grave crime,"" HC said. As per the prosecution, Madhuresh killed victim Khushbu Mishra in her flat in Pune on October 20, 2008. Both were 22 at the time and had moved to the city after securing jobs there. The duo was in a relationship during their college days in Madhya Pradesh. After shifting to Pune, the woman broke up with Madhuresh due to differences, enraging him. He then started harassing and threatening her. The court noted that the victim had also complained to their office against the accused for harassing her, following which he was reprimanded. Upholding Madhuresh's conviction, the HC said the prosecution has submitted a complete chain of circumstances that clearly indicate that it was none other than him who committed the murder. The motive behind the offence was anger and jealousy as the victim had ended the relationship, HC added.

"3 Stocks to Buy in October That Could Soar 34% or More Over the Next 12 Months, According to Wall Street Analysts | The Motley Fool","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says stocks are ""fairly highly valued."" Warren Buffett almost certainly agrees. The valuation metric that bears his name, the Buffett indicator, which measures U.S. total stock market capitalization to gross domestic product (GDP), is at an all-time high, indicating such. But can stocks still go higher? Absolutely. Some hold the potential to deliver especially explosive gains. Here are three stocks to buy in October that could soar 34% or more over the next 12 months, according to Wall Street analysts. Nebius Group (NBIS 1.85%) is a Netherlands-based artificial intelligence (AI) hyperscaler. It operates large-scale GPU clusters for hosting AI applications across Europe, and the U.S. Nebius Avride subsidiary develops autonomous vehicle technology for ride-hailing and delivery robots. Its TripleTen subsidiary operates a leading educational technology platform for workers in the technology sector. Few stocks have been hotter than Nebius Group in 2025. Its share price has more than quadrupled year to date. Wall Street thinks the stock could go much higher. The consensus 12-month price target for Nebius reflects an upside potential of 34%. Is this bullish view warranted? Probably so. Nebius Group's revenue in the second quarter of 2025 more than doubled -- not compared to the prior year period, but to the previous quarter. Founder and CEO Arkady Volozh said in the Q2 update, ""demand for AI infrastructure -- compute, software, and services -- is only going to get stronger as use cases multiply."" Nebius Group is rapidly scaling its capacity to capitalize on its huge opportunity. The company's main risk is a significant economic slowdown that curtails spending on AI infrastructure. Its valuation (Nebius' price-to-sales ratio is 98, a nosebleed level) could also be problematic if the company's growth slows. On Holding (ONON -2.87%) is one of the world's fastest-growing athletic sportswear companies. Founded in Switzerland in 2010, On has sold over 50 million products to date and has a presence in more than 80 countries. Its products include ""premium"" apparel, shoes, and accessories for high-performance sports. Unlike Nebius Group, On Holding hasn't been a big winner so far in 2025. The stock is down more than 20% year to date. However, Wall Street thinks a rebound could be on the way. The average 12-month price target for On Holding is roughly 55% higher than the current share price. On's business is booming. The company's net sales jumped 32% year over year in Q2, reaching a record high. On expects full-year net sales to grow by at least 31% on a constant-currency basis. What's not to like? For one thing, On posted a net loss in its latest quarter. And its stock isn't cheap, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of nearly 28. The company also faces intense competition from rivals with deep pockets. The Trade Desk (TTD -1.21%) operates a leading technology platform for buyers of digital advertising. Its cloud-based software enables ad buyers to run targeted advertising campaigns online and on streaming TV services. Once a high-flying stock, The Trade Desk's momentum screeched to a halt beginning in late 2024. The company's shares have plunged almost 60% in 2025. However, analysts believe that The Trade Desk can regain ground over the next 12 months. The consensus price target reflects an upside potential of 43%. The Trade Desk's revenue jumped 19% year over year in Q2. That's not bad, but it's well below the 26% year-over-year growth the company delivered in the same quarter of 2024. With slowing growth, why is Wall Street still optimistic about The Trade Desk's prospects? For one thing, analysts know the company's platform remains popular with customers, as evidenced by a customer retention rate of 95%. They also appreciate how big The Trade Desk's opportunity is, especially with continued growth in ad-supported connected TV.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T09:05:26Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-stocks-to-buy-in-october-that-could-soar-more-th/,2025-10-01 17:27:02.164211,0.08235294117647052

"Billionaires and Harvard's Endowment Are Piling Into a BlackRock ETF That Could Climb More Than 1,000%, According to Experts | The Motley Fool","This ETF offers the easiest way to invest in a high-potential asset class. Studying what the biggest and best investors in the world are doing with their and their clients' money can provide some interesting ideas for the average investor. Luckily for us, every investment fund with at least $150 million in publicly traded U.S. securities has to file a quarterly form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing their portfolio holdings. The most recent round of filings revealed several hedge funds and the largest university endowment in the world all piling into BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT 0.05%). The exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC 2.32%), offering an easy way for investment funds to gain exposure to the crypto asset class. Here are just a handful of billionaires putting their funds to work in the BlackRock ETF: Many analysts are bullish on Bitcoin, and growing investment from institutional investors like those above are a big reason. Here's why the BlackRock ETF could soar more than 10-fold during the coming years. Many long-term outlooks see Bitcoin climbing from about $114,000 per coin today to more than $1 million. There are two key factors driving those estimates: institutional adoption and the growth of Bitcoin as an inflation-protected investment. Institutional investors hold more than $100 trillion in assets currently. That amount could nearly double during the next decade based on historical growth. With $200 trillion in assets under management, a 1% allocation toward Bitcoin could add $2 trillion to Bitcoin's market cap. That amount would be enough to nearly double Bitcoin's value from today. Ark's analysts have a base case of 2.5% allocation from institutions, which could more than triple its value or more when you consider not all Bitcoins are available for purchase. The bigger growth driver, however, could come from Bitcoin overtaking gold as a store of value. Gold's current market cap exceeds $25 trillion. That's more than 10 times the total value of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, some analysts expect the recent strength of gold to continue as more investors seek an inflation hedge. That could result in the market for inflation-protected investments nearly doubling by the end of the decade. If Bitcoin takes one-quarter to one-half of that market, it could add $12 trillion to $25 trillion in market cap. That would increase Bitcoin's value by about 10-fold, on the high end. There are other factors that could drive the value of Bitcoin higher as well, including purchases by corporate and sovereign nation-state treasuries and growing adoption as a safe asset in emerging markets. But the potential market sizes for those aren't nearly as big as institutional adoption and the store-of-value argument. Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, and it could easily see its value cut in half in short order. Even the biggest Bitcoin bulls won't deny that the short-term volatility of Bitcoin is a meaningful risk for investors. Still, a small allocation of your portfolio to Bitcoin could make sense for many investors as a diversification asset with significant long-term upside potential. It's important to note, however, long-term price predictions are extremely unlikely to be totally accurate. But based on the analysis presented, these forecasts likely at least directionally accurate. It may be worth digging into the details of how these analysts came to their conclusions and price targets and developing your own model and assessing your own risk tolerance to determine whether Bitcoin deserves a spot in your portfolio.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T09:05:26Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/billionaires-and-harvards-endowment-are-piling-int/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.489767,0.4588235294117646
I inherited a near-collapsed economy - Tinubu,"Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has revealed that the country's economy was on the brink of collapse at the time of his inauguration in May 2023. ""Upon assuming office, our administration inherited a near-collapsed economy caused by decades of fiscal policy distortions and misalignment that had impaired real growth,"" said Tinubu. Tinubu made the statement during a national broadcast to the nation on Wednesday morning, marking the country's 65th Independence Anniversary. According to him, this situation put his administration in a tight corner and he had no choice but to implement reforms to revive the country's economy. ""As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform,"" Tinubu added. During his inauguration, Tinubu announced the total removal of the petrol subsidy. According to Tinubu, the petrol subsidy only benefited a minority of the population. ""In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our Commonwealth,"" Tinubu said. For years, petrol subsidy served as a cover shielding Nigerians from hardship. Following the removal of the subsidy, the pump price increased. By implication, the prices of goods and services skyrocketed, throwing millions of Nigerians into unprecedented hardship. Some economic experts have described the President's reforms as unfavourable, but the President has insisted on many occasions that the reforms will propel the country's economy to higher grounds. He reiterated this on Wednesday morning, saying, ""We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit.""",The Guardian,2025-10-01T09:04:14Z,https://guardian.ng/news/i-inherited-a-near-collapsed-economy-tinubu/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.489993,0.1137254901960785
Map shows where lands could be opened by Trump for coal mining,"The Trump administration has announced plans to open 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining, as part of President Donald Trump's aim to bolster the shrinking U.S. coal industry. The policy, unveiled Monday, includes subsidies of $625 million for recommissioning and modernizing coal-fired power plants, and a reduction in federal royalty rates for miners. The move follows executive orders signed by Trump aimed at reversing the industry's decline and increasing America's domestic energy output. The plan represents one of the largest expansions of coal mining access on federal land in recent decades, and raises questions about the direction of U.S. energy policy and commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Supporters argue the move will create jobs, secure domestic energy, and support communities dependent on the coal sector, while critics warn it will slow the transition to cleaner energy, increase pollution, and reverse progress in greenhouse gas reduction. The 13 million acres of federal land for potential coal mining leases could be made available in states such as Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Alabama and North Dakota -- a number of existing and historically productive coal regions. This comes after the Energy Department previously ordered fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand. The share of coal in U.S. electricity production has dropped dramatically in the last decade, down from 45 percent in 2010 to about 15 percent in 2024. Trump has also told the Energy and Interior departments, together with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to remove barriers to coal leasing and extraction and to expedite permits. The EPA also announced on Monday a delay in enforcing seven wastewater pollution regulations for coal plants and started a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to the regional haze rule, which limits pollution in national parks. This also follows Trump's sweeping tax bill reducing the royalty rate paid by mining companies to the federal government from 12.5 percent to 7 percent earlier this year. Some have said the move could have a positive impact on job opportunities. ""Opening land for coal mining would produce more jobs for people in certain regions,"" Susan Brantley, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, told Newsweek. However, others say this will not be the case. ""The argument about job creation is false because highly mechanized coal mining creates few jobs while destroying other economic opportunity,"" Michael Hendryx, a professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at Indiana University Bloomington, told Newsweek. He added that data indicates areas with higher coal mining have higher unemployment and higher poverty rates than areas with less mining or no mining. Environmental groups have also slated the move, with Jill Tauber, vice-president of litigation for climate and energy at the environmental association Earthjustice, saying that ""expanding mining and spending taxpayer money on burning coal, while rolling back vital health protections, will only exacerbate the deadly pollution and rising electricity bills that communities are facing across the country."" Jenny Harbine, Northern Rockies managing attorney at Earthjustice, also told Newsweek: ""While our country was on track to put coal in our rear-view mirror, we have an administration hell-bent on driving in reverse."" Putting environmental concerns aside, Harbine also said that the move made ""no sense"" considering coal ""can't compete with cheaper and cleaner wind, solar, and storage resources."" ""The administration is trying to rig the economics by reducing the royalty rates companies pay for publicly-owned coal and expanding mining on our federal public lands,"" she added. ""Make no mistake, coal is still on its way out, but the administration's insistence on prolonging its exit will mean more air and water pollution, a hotter climate, and missed opportunities to fully embrace the economic and environmental benefits of clean energy."" Hendryx also said the move would lead to more environmental destruction, more local air and water pollution from mining sites, more pollution from power plants, more harmful contributions to climate change emissions, and other negative impacts. ""It is a stupid, short-sighted, destructive decision,"" he said. He continued that while average Americans may not notice an immediate difference, ""some of the negative consequences from pollution and climate change will show up later."" ""Community residents near mining sites might notice more air and water quality problems,"" he said. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement: ""President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we're delivering. By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing, and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security, and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs. Washington doesn't build prosperity, American workers and entrepreneurs do, and we're giving them the tools to succeed."" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement: ""Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable. It is time to restore common sense to the programs and regulations we use to protect human health and the environment. Beautiful clean coal has been a reliable energy source supporting American communities and economic growth for generations. We can improve air quality in our national parks and protect our waterways while simultaneously unleashing domestic energy and reducing costs for American families."" Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement: ""Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America's reindustrialization and winning the AI race. These funds will help keep our nation's coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption. Coal built the greatest industrial engine the world has ever known, and with President Trump's leadership, it will help do so again."" The National Mining Association shared the following statement with Newsweek from CEO, Rich Nolan: ""Our vast coal resources and existing coal fleet are foundational pieces of U.S. energy security and economic competitiveness. While AI and data centers drive electricity demands increasingly higher on an already stressed grid, and the world's steel-hungry infrastructure, construction and emerging markets continue to grow, America's coal miners are ready to meet the need. The administration's comprehensive energy dominance strategy will ensure that our coal fleet can continue to buttress grid reliability with fuel-secure, dispatchable power-a significant win for American industry and consumers facing the specter of power shortfalls and rising electricity prices, and global customers needing high-quality coal."" Brantley told Newsweek: ""Coal is the dirtiest source of energy we know because it releases carbon into the atmosphere along with sulfur that rains back to the ground as acid rain, impacting fish and other creatures. Coal has been replaced in the U.S. as natural gas dropped in price with the increased use of new forms of fracking. In Pennsylvania, we see cleaner water and cleaner air because we burn less coal and more gas. Like all people, President Trump wants a clean environment and his choice to promote coal is confusing because it contradicts that."" She added: ""There are environmental drawbacks to everything we do, including our use of renewable energy. Simply put, humans cannot survive without generating pollution. But environmental drawbacks of coal far outweigh those of renewables, and because pollutants are released to the atmosphere, they spread regionally or globally. The fastest growing energy sources are wind and solar and I can't think of any reason why our President would not be supporting that growth instead of coal: with renewable fuels, the pollution impacts are lower than for coal. Americans have felt the negatives from mining and using coal for a hundred years and we are lucky today to have discovered newer and cleaner ways to generate electricity.""",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-where-lands-could-be-opened-trump-coal-mining-10803243,2025-10-01 17:27:04.490828,0.2627450980392156
Beko scales Second-Life 'Reduce-Refurbish-Recycle' program to factory level across Europe,"- Beko extends product lifecycles, proving that circularity delivers both affordability and sustainability. - In 2024, more than 114,000 appliances were refurbished globally, preventing wastethrough dedicated refurbishment centers in the UK, Italy, and Romania. ISTANBUL, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Beko, a leader in home appliances, today announced significant progress in its refurbishment strategy, with the scale up of Reduce-Refurbish-Recycle, the company's integrated returns and refurbishment program that transforms returned appliances into high-quality second-life products at factory scale. The approach ensures appliances remain functional, cuts waste and cost, and brings essential main home appliances within reach for more households, without compromising performance or safety and by significantly contributing to the circular economy. ""Refurbishment is about more than repairing appliances - it's about extending lifecycles, reducing waste, and giving consumers access to reliable, affordable products,"" said Fatih Özkadı, Chief Sustainability, Quality and Customer Care Officer. ""By investing in advanced refurbishment centers across Europe, we are proving that circularity can drive both sustainability and create value for households, while expanding our program to localize access to second-life Beko appliances through outlet shops and partner routes - ensuring refurbished units are available where demand is highest and consistent quality is maintained across every market."" Customer care is central to Beko's operations. The Reduce - Refurbish - Recycle Program begins with customer service, with most issues resolved remotely or during an engineer visit, reducing unnecessary returns and extending product life. Appliances that do enter refurbishment are tested, repaired with genuine parts, graded, and re-audited to ensure they perform in accordance with safety and reliability principles. The result is a closed-loop cycle that adds value for customers and the business. As European consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability, Beko's refurbishment strategy offers high-quality, affordable second-life appliances that reduce waste and extend value. At the heart of the network is Beko's Peterborough (UK) refurbishment center, a nearly 5,000 m² site that has been operating with zero waste to landfill since 2019. The site holds over 100,000 spare parts, manages 55 packaging types, and applies quality audits (QA) to up to 30% of refurbished units from different product categories before resale. Beyond the UK, Beko's European refurbishment footprint is growing. In Carinaro (Italy), in 2024 alone, appliances were refurbished across washing machines, cooking, cooling, dishwashing, and drying categories. The center employs 15 operatives and positions refurbished products at 10-30% below retail prices, making sustainable choices more accessible. In Romania, Beko aims to return more than three-quarters (75%) of eligible products to circulation, further proving that circular operations can be systematic, repeatable and market-specific. Beko's sustainability communications framework aligns the initiative with UN Sustainable Development Goals, enabling local teams to tailor messages while maintaining one European story of circularity at scale. About Beko Beko is an international home appliance company with a strong global presence, operating through subsidiaries in more than 55 countries with a workforce of over 50,000 employees and production facilities spanning multiple regions including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Lawmen rescue 4 potential human trafficking victims in Tawi-Tawi,"LAWMEN have rescued potential human trafficking victims as they tightened the watch in the southern backdoor's province of Tawi-Tawi, the police said Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Police Major Randy Veran, chief of the Tawi-Tawi Maritime Police Station (Marpsta), said the potential victims were rescued around 4 p.m. Tuesday, September 30, at the port of Bongao, the province's capital town. Veran said the rescued victims include two males and two females, who were recruited in different parts of the country. They were rescued during the conduct of profiling of passengers aboard a commercial ferry that had just dock at the port of Bongao. Veran said they conducted the profiling of passengers after they received reliable information that there are individuals who will be traveling to Malaysia via backdoor on board the passenger vessel that arrived in Bongao. Investigation showed the four individuals were recruited and promised good salary by their recruiters who are residents Kampung Batu, Sempornah, Sabah, Malaysia and Bentulu, Serawak, also in Sabah, Malaysia. They were turned over to the Ministry of Social Services and Development Office-Bongao for proper disposition, counseling and stress debriefing. Veran advised the public, especially those who wish to work in Malaysia and nearby countries, to apply legally for their protection against human trafficking.

Greggs steady in stormy retail climate,"Greggs has posted a modest rise in third-quarter sales, underscoring both the resilience and the challenges of operating in a highly competitive and inflation-sensitive market. The high street bakery chain reported total sales growth of 6.1% in the 13 weeks to 27 September 2025, with like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rising by 1.5%. The figures mark an improvement after a sluggish July, when unusually hot weather dampened appetite for Greggs' traditionally hearty fare. Trading conditions normalised in August and September, helping to restore momentum. Year-to-date, total sales are up 6.7%, with like-for-like growth of 2.2%. While the numbers are solid, they suggest Greggs is finding it harder to achieve the double-digit growth seen in parts of its post-pandemic recovery. The chain opened 130 new shops in the year to date, while closing 73 - including relocations - for a net gain of 57. It expects around 120 net new openings for the full year, slightly below earlier forecasts but still reflecting a strong pipeline heading into 2026. The expansion is not limited to the high street. Partnerships with Tesco and Sainsbury's are enabling Greggs to reach customers in supermarkets and convenience formats, while its frozen ""Bake at Home"" range now has listings in 930 Iceland and 820 Tesco stores. Greggs has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its sausage rolls and steak bakes. Autumn menu launches included high-protein Egg Pots and Protein Shakes, alongside the return of seasonal crowd-pleasers such as the Pumpkin Spice Latte. Innovation in savouries continues too, with the Pulled Pork Sandwich expanding to 350 shops and new bakes catering to flexitarian demand. The strategy is clear: adapt to changing consumer habits while maintaining Greggs' reputation for affordability. Two major distribution projects remain central to Greggs' expansion strategy. A new frozen product facility in Derby is scheduled to open in 2026, while a chilled and ambient national centre in Kettering is due to come online in 2027. Both sites are intended to support estate growth and improve efficiency at a time when cost control remains critical. City analysts offered a mixed response to Greggs' latest update. RBC Capital Markets noted that like-for-like performance was ""OK"", with August and September showing signs of recovery after a weak July. Analyst Ross Broadfoot cautioned, however, that volumes ""remain weak"" and flagged the slower rollout of new stores as an ongoing concern. The focus, he suggested, will now shift to the fourth quarter, where comparatives are more favourable. Panmure Liberum took a slightly more optimistic stance, moving its recommendation to ""hold"" from ""sell"". Analyst Ben Hunt said that while third-quarter trading was soft and the slowdown in store openings raises questions, forecasts for 2025 look more secure thanks to easing cost inflation and softer comparatives ahead. Even so, he warned that expectations for like-for-like growth to accelerate to 3.5% in later years remain ""ambitious"", given muted volumes and limited progress in evening and delivery sales. Despite ongoing headwinds in the wider retail sector, Greggs said the outlook for cost inflation in 2025 had ""marginally improved"""". Even so, the company stopped short of upgrading its full-year guidance, keeping expectations unchanged. The cautious tone reflects both opportunity and risk: the brand continues to grow its footprint and experiment with new products, but faces a consumer environment where discretionary spending is under constant pressure. Greggs' third-quarter performance shows a business that is steady rather than spectacular.

House servant who robbed Delhi employer's house nabbed after 12 years,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (PTI) A man evading arrest for 12 years after robbing employer of her jewellery in West Delhi's Kirti Nagar was arrested from Rajasthan, police said on Wednesday. Gautam Yadav, 32, from Jamui district in Bihar, was declared a proclaimed offender and carried a reward of Rs 20,000 on his arrest, they said. Yadav was apprehended from Jaipur on September 30. According to the FIR registered at Kirti Nagar Police Station on March 8, 2013, Yadav, then employed as a servant, conspired with three of his associates to rob his employer when she was alone at home. ""The gang overpowered her, tied her hands and legs, gagged her mouth and looted two gold bangles, a gold chain with a locket, and a gold ring before fleeing,"" an officer said. During the investigation back then, police nabbed two of his associates, while Yadav remained at large. While on the run, Yadav kept moving, worked odd jobs, and stayed away from his village. During questioning, he revealed that he shifted base across states, including Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, and finally landed in Rajasthan, to stay under the radar. All this while, he took up menial jobs and also drove an e-rickshaw, the officer said. Yadav, who is uneducated, came in contact with local criminals early and was led to rob the very house he worked in when he was all of 20, the officer added.

Shear determination: Teen cosmetology grad opens her own salon in Lexington,"""Can't"" isn't in 19-year-old Gabby Hutchins' vocabulary. When she was told she can't open her own salon right after cosmetology school because everyone works at a someone else's salon first, she wouldn't listen. When she was told by some lending institutions that she can't get a loan to open her salon because she doesn't have enough credit history or business experience, she kept searching for another lender. Her can-do attitude led her to her dream of opening her own business -- Ridged Edge Salon -- in Lexington on Sept. 25, a few months after graduating from Aisling Institute's cosmetology program in Kernersville. The 2023 North Davidson High graduate will host a grand opening celebration from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Oct. 18. ""I have always wanted to do hair,"" Hutchins said while sitting at the counter of her newly opened 10-station salon at Center 64 West shopping center between Guadalahara Grill and a smoke shop. ""I have picture of me when I was 5 or 6 dressed up as a hair stylist for career day. I loved going to to the hair salon growing up."" Hutchins said it's an honor to have someone trust her with their hair, which is tied closely to their identity. She loves the process of creating a new look for someone. Hutchins' sister, Olivia, now 17, was her earliest test model, letting her experiment with color and new looks. From middle school on, Hutchins remembers telling everyone she was going to open her own salon as soon as she graduated from cosmetology school. That's not the norm, however. Usually, stylists work for at least a few years for someone else before opening their own salon. Some never do. ""Every single person I told this to told me, 'No you can't do that,'"" she recalled. ""Even some of my family said, 'Girl, we love you, but you can't do that.' I said, 'Watch me.'"" Hutchins also had discussions with and reviews of her business plan by staff at Davidson-Davie Community College's Small Business Center. That helped her navigate the business license, inspection and building permit requirements to open a business. When she went for financing, she ran into the first obstacle. ""No one wanted to loan me money to do this. I had one year's worth of credit history with a credit card,"" she said. ""I have to give a shout out to Pinnacle Bank, who saw my vision and believed in me. It was so easy once I went to Pinnacle."" So far, Hutchins has two stylists signed on to work in her 10-chair salon, along with one nail technician and one esthetician. She is in talks with other stylists to come work at Ridged Edge and has room for a second nail technician. ""I didn't want to work for anybody. That's why I opened this place,"" she said. ""I don't want the stylists that come here to work to feel like they are working for someone else either. They are their own bosses, setting their times and can sell their own retail (hair products) and make money that way, too."" The stylists can also sell the salon's hair products and earn commission. Hutchins has always preferred to work for herself. In a 2023 story in The Dispatch about teen entrepreneurs, she was featured for her home-based business creating custom designs for T-shirts, keychains, stainless steel tumblers and more. Hutchins said she is grateful for all the help her family and boyfriend gave her in getting the salon renovated and open. Her dad laid down the new floor and baseboards while the rest of the family and her boyfriend, Tyler, spent hours putting together salon furniture, shelving and chairs. The building was formerly a sweepstakes business. ""There was nicotine dripping down the walls from the smoking in here, and there was carpet on the floor,"" she said. ""We hired painters to come in and Kilz the walls and paint them to get that smoke smell out of here. Tyler would get off work ... at 5 p.m., and we would be in here until after 11 every night doing stuff."" The grand opening celebration on Oct. 18 will feature Debbie Manual, owner of neighboring Brooks Nest Boutique, doing permanent jewelry. Also, there will be someone offering flash tattoos and botox. A mimosa bar, giveaways and door prizes will round out the day. The usual hours of operation for Ridged Edge Salon are 10 a.m.-4 p.m.on Monday; 10 a.m.- 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday and 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Saturday. Call 336-300-8881 for an appointment. Walk-ins are also welcome. The salon's address is 217 U.S. East Highway 64 Unit 2.",Lexington Dispatch,2025-10-01T09:05:29Z,https://www.the-dispatch.com/news/business/shear-determination-teen-cosmetology-grad-opens-her-own-salon-in-lexington/article_5fb2ff7b-a380-581f-bf92-317ea96946f1.html,2025-10-01 17:27:04.493692,0.2549019607843137
African industries face shock as AGOA expires,"African apparel and textile manufacturers will be the hardest hit by the end of the US tariff-free trade scheme. Africa's apparel and textile manufacturers will be hardest hit by the end of the US's tariff-free African Growth and Opportunity Act, according to research by the International Trade Center (ITC). AGOA, which has provided dozens of African countries with tariff-free access to the US market since it was signed into US law in 2000, was allowed to lapse on September 30 by the Trump administration, bringing an end to preferences for 32 countries, of whom 22 qualified for apparel provisions. Across all sectors, tariff measures introduced in 2025 are estimated to reduce projected exports of AGOA beneficiaries by about 8% by 2029. The expiry of AGOA adds a further decline of 0.6 percentage points, or $189m. $138m of that will be accounted for by reductions in apparel and textile products, which are expected to register decline of 9.7% in textile and apparel exports to the United States by 2029 as a result of the end of AGOA, by far the greatest impact on any sector. Skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (-3.3%), processed food and animal feed (-1.6%) and vehicles (-1.3%) are the next most affected. The ITC says the expiry of AGOA will increase duties in value-added and labour-intensive sectors that had benefited most from preferential access. The steepest hikes are observed in apparel & textile products (+14 percentage points), skins, leather, products thereof and footwear (+4.3) and processed food & animal feed (+2.4), where competitiveness has relied heavily on duty-free entry under AGOA. In recent months, the administration has hit African and non-African countries with tariffs, further exacerbating the impact of the end of AGOA. The total reduction on exports to the US - when tariffs and the end of AGOA are combined - is estimated to be -8.7% by 2029. For the apparel industry, the 14 percentage point increase from the end of AGOA combined with 13 percentage point increase from 2025 tariffs leads to a total tariff increase of 27 percentage points. AGOA contained special provisions for textiles and apparel, including the ""third-country fabric allowance."" This rule, available only to ""least developed"" countries approved for apparel eligibility, allows them to source fabric globally while still exporting finished apparel duty-free to the United States. It was instrumental in enabling countries such as Lesotho, Kenya and Madagascar to establish competitive apparel industries. More advanced economies such as South Africa and Mauritius, while granted apparel eligibility, did not benefit from the third-country fabric allowance and were subject to stricter rules of origin requiring fabric sourced from the United States or other AGOA beneficiaries. Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the ITC, said the end of AGOA and the introduction of US tariffs could have a devastating impact on apparel exporters. ""If AGOA were to lapse, it will deal a blow to African countries already feeling the weight of new trade measures, from the latest tariffs to sustainability requirements. Access to key markets is becoming more difficult, and African countries - especially the least developed - are feeling the strain. Take Lesotho. Nearly 60% of its apparel exports go to the US, worth over $230m annually. Under AGOA, those goods entered the US market duty-free. Today, they face a 15% tariff. That may sound small, compared with the initial 50%, but this move has led to cancelled orders, lost jobs and reduced competitiveness vis-à-vis neighbours like Kenya and Eswatini, which face a 10% rate. Lesotho's textile industry employs 40,000 people. This is affecting real people, real lives.""",African Business,2025-10-01T09:04:57Z,https://african.business/2025/10/trade-investment/african-industries-face-shock-as-agoa-expires,2025-10-01 17:27:04.494091,0.2156862745098038

ZEC Price Surges to 38-Month High: Can It Break $90?,"Positive Balance of Power at 0.75 shows buyers dominating, boosting odds of a rally toward $98.80 if support holds. Privacy-focused cryptocurrency ZEC is today's top gainer, climbing 17% in the past 24 hours as broader market activity shows signs of gradual recovery. The rally has propelled ZEC to a 38-month high, marking its strongest performance in more than three years. With momentum building, on-chain and technical indicators suggest that the token could soon test the $90 threshold. ZEC's price has surged 47% in the past week. These double-digit gains have coincided with a sharp rise in its social dominance, indicating that conversations around the altcoin are expanding across crypto communities. At press time, ZEC's social dominance sits at a three-year high of 0.51%, climbing by 458% in the past three days alone. For token TA and market updates: Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. An asset's social dominance tracks how often it is mentioned across social platforms and news outlets relative to the rest of the market. When its value falls, it signals that the asset is losing attention and engagement from the community, which may affect its price. On the other hand, when an asset's social dominance climbs with its price, it means heightened retail attention and speculative interest. Historically, such heightened chatter and visibility have translated into short-term price boosts. This may, in turn, propel ZEC's price further. Moreover, readings from ZEC's Balance of Power (BoP) on the daily chart support this outlook. As of this writing, the momentum is positive (0.75) and continues to climb, confirming stronger spot demand. The BoP indicator measures the strength of buying versus selling pressure in the market. When its value is positive, buyers are gradually exerting more control over price action and shifting momentum firmly into bullish territory. This increases the likelihood of a sustained rally for ZEC. At press time, ZEC trades near the key support floor at $79.21. If demand persists and this price level strengthens, it could drive the token's price toward $98.80. On the other hand, if profit-taking commences, ZEC could lose recent gains, break below the support floor at $79.21, and fall toward $67.09.",BeInCrypto,2025-10-01T08:30:00Z,https://beincrypto.com/zec-price-surges-to-38-month-high/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.494756,0.2078431372549019
"Don't overlook White Horse Village, a retirement gem","When visitors tour White Horse Village in Edgmont Township, Delaware County, they're often surprised by the spaciousness, natural beauty and exceptional amenities. These aren't units stacked together in a high-rise. The homes and apartments feature outdoor areas with space for a garden or patio chair, fitting in with the peaceful appeal of its tree-lined sidewalks and more than 100 acres of meadow adjoining the serenity of Ridley Creek State Park.

""Honestly, I am surprised how great it is,"" she said. ""It's just perfect."" Perhaps most importantly, White Horse Village offers more than just a place to live -- it is an active and welcoming community.

Better Warren Buffett Buy: Coca Cola vs. American Express | The Motley Fool,"Any investor would love to follow in Warren Buffett's footsteps, choosing stocks that over time will create a billion-dollar portfolio. The storied investor manages more than $257 billion in securities at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway and has generated market-beating returns over almost 60 years. While our portfolios may not hit the $1 billion mark, I have good news for you: Following some of Buffett's moves could help lift the value of your portfolio and shepherd you along the path to wealth. This means adding some of Buffett's investing principles to your own strategy -- for example, a focus on long-term investing -- and including a couple of his favorite stocks in your portfolio. So, let's get started by considering two players the billionaire has owned for decades: Coca-Cola (KO 0.44%) and American Express (AXP -2.93%). In Buffett's 2023 shareholder letter, he wrote: ""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke -- extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends."" These have been players Buffett has relied on over time. Now the question is, if you could buy only one today, which one should you choose? Let's find out. Buffett is known to drink Coca-Cola's eponymous beverage every day, and he isn't the only one. The company is the world's biggest maker of nonalcoholic beverages and has a fantastic moat, or competitive advantage -- this is its brand strength as well as its global distribution network. Buffett loves moats, as these may ensure a company's market position and therefore earnings strength over time. Coca-Cola isn't a high-growth player, with revenue climbing only 1% in the recent quarter, but over a period of years, the company has been reliable, progressively increasing revenue and net income. And though Coca-Cola is most known for Coca-Cola and variations such as Diet Coke, the company owns a variety of popular drinks, from Fuze Tea to Minute Maid juices. Meanwhile, the beverage giant also innovates according to the tastes of different countries to drive growth and uses data to offer drink sizes and formats that appeal to specific markets too. This should keep the company on the right path as the overall market evolves. Finally, what Buffett may like best about Coca-Cola is the company's dividend growth. As a Dividend King, it's lifted the payout for more than 50 consecutive years -- a sign that rewarding investors is important to the company and that it's likely to continue along this path. Today, Coca-Cola pays a dividend of $2.04, representing a yield of 3% -- that surpasses the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.41%) dividend yield of 1.2%. You may think that American Express, as a credit card giant, would be a risky bet as any economic downturn may weigh on the company. But that actually isn't the case, and here's why: American Express, as a premium card company, generally attracts members in higher income categories, and these users are less likely to suffer in difficult economies. In fact, in many instances, American Express has noted that this cohort keeps on spending. Why do high-income consumers like American Express so much? For two major reasons. First, the company acts quickly to help customers when problems arise -- like potential fraudulent use of a card, for example. And second, American Express offers customers many perks, such as discounts at restaurants and upgrades at hotels. All this has helped the company increase earnings over time, and in the recent quarter, revenue reached a record of nearly $18 billion. Importantly, American Express is generating significant growth from younger customers -- a sign that its revenue momentum may continue over the years to come. In the recent quarter, 63% of global new accounts were for millennial and Gen-Z consumers. Finally, Buffett clearly likes American Express for its dividend too, as the company pays shareholders $3.16 per share for a yield of 0.9%. So, which Buffett favorite makes the better buy -- the beverage giant or the credit card powerhouse? Both stocks actually trade at almost exactly the same valuation right now, as you can see in the chart, though Coca-Cola's valuation has declined a bit, while American Express' has advanced to reach this level. I would say the answer to this question, though, depends on your strategy. If you're a cautious investor looking for dividend income over time, Coca-Cola makes a great buy today, on this small dip in valuation. Coca-Cola is the ultimate Buffett dividend stock, in my opinion. But if you're a growth-oriented investor, it's worth picking up American Express, as it's still reasonably priced -- and earnings and the stock price may deliver stronger gains over time.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T08:04:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-warren-buffett-buy-coca-cola-vs-american-ex/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.496353,0.3176470588235294
Is WOLF iheading back under $5 (despite hopes / manipulation) for NYSE:WOLF by onlytrade2win,"⚠️ Key Fundamentals * Revenue: ~ $757.6 million for the latest reported period * Net Income (Loss): -$1.61 billion Business North Carolina * Net Margin: around -222 % (i.e. negative, deep loss relative to revenues) -- the company is burning far more than it makes. Some quarters, more than its market value!!! Even if management / market participants try accounting maneuvers, non-recurring adjustments, or any ""creative"" financial engineering, you cannot paper over a massive negative margin indefinitely. 🔍 Why this matters long term Burn rate: A company losing $1.6 billion on a revenue base of $0.75 billion is not sustainable unless there is serious capital infusion and/or structural turn. Dilution risk: To remain afloat, they must keep raising capital (debt, equity), which dilutes existing shareholders. Interest and debt burden: Losses restrict ability to service debt or absorb interest costs. Investor confidence / credibility: Repeated negative quarters erode trust; ""accounting manipulation"" talk raises red flags for institutional investors. 📉 Thoughts Given the magnitude of losses, lack of positive margins, and risk of dilution / restructuring, it is quite plausible WOLF may revisit levels below $5, unless some dramatic turnaround (new profitable segment, acquisition, or breakthrough tech) happens soon.",TradingView,2025-10-01T09:01:10Z,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/WOLF/05v1bAp9-Is-WOLF-iheading-back-under-5-despite-hopes-manipulation/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.496534,-0.2
Aster DEX Stumbles: Token Plunges 15% Amid Community FUD,"Technical analysis shows a falling wedge pattern suggesting a 24% upside, but bearish RSI and resistance levels may extend ASTER's current consolidation. Aster, the decentralized exchange (DEX) that has gained traction in recent weeks, is facing mounting scrutiny and a rocky start to October. It follows the DEX's move to acknowledge inconsistencies in its Team Boost dashboard data alongside accusations of inflating trading volumes. The controversy has coincided with a sharp sell-off in the ASTER token, which fell almost 16% in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, ASTER was trading for $1.57. The move left some traders liquidated, but others continue to hold out hope, anticipating a break above a crucial resistance trendline. The drop comes as Aster DEX admitted to discrepancies in the personal dashboards of Stage 2 users during Epoch 3. ""These issues may have been related to how the mechanism was presented and described, which could have caused some confusion,"" the team wrote. It concerns the Aster Genesis program, DEX's initiative to distribute 4% of the ASTER token supply via an airdrop and reward users for trading and referrals. Stage 2 began earlier in 2025 and is in its final phase with two epochs left, ending on October 5, 2025, at 23:59 UTC. Epoch 3 is the current weekly cycle (Monday 00:00 UTC to Sunday 23:59 UTC), making this issue timely as users maximize Rh points for the airdrop. The Team Boost Mechanism feature allows users to earn up to a 1.5x multiplier on Rh points based on their referral team's cumulative trading volume. The inconsistency suggests a display error or a calculation flaw, impacting perceived rewards. With Stage 2 nearing its end and ASTER's recent 6,000% surge, accurate data is critical for users farming points and trading leveraged positions. Aster assured users that fixes are underway and adjustments are expected to be completed soon. Notwithstanding, other users expressed dissatisfaction with the project and called for more transparency. The community has voiced deeper concerns, with some users questioning the validity of Aster's reported trading activity. Among them, a user noted that the project had claimed $560 billion in volume between September 22 and 28 during Epoch 3. ""This number does not match Dune or DefiLama, so please take all my numbers with a grain of salt, as ASTER is clearly comfortable with manipulating RH as they please,"" he wrote. These allegations strike at the heart of Aster's ongoing airdrop campaign, which has been a key driver of user participation. Inflated figures could undermine trust in the reward system's fairness, especially as some users report losing significant funds during the latest price drop. Nevertheless, Binance executive Changpeng Zhao sees the drop as a shakeout for weak hands. Despite the sharp decline, neither Aster's team nor the DEX's CEO, Leonard (likely a pseudonym), has directly addressed the accusations of volume manipulation or wash trading. Meanwhile, the ASTER/USDT trading pair shows that the ASTER price may be preparing for a bullish move. On the one-hour timeframe, the Aster price has been consolidating within a falling wedge pattern since September 24. This is a bullish reversal pattern in technical analysis. It hints at a 24% upside if the ASTER price exceeds $1.8078. Based on the bullish volume profiles (blue horizontal bars), ASTER bulls wait to interact with the price upon breakout, potentially accentuating the 24% rally to the $2.2657 target objective. However, based on the bearish volume profiles (yellow horizontal bars), the $1.9814 resistance level is critical, with a lot of bears also waiting to interact with ASTER price around that level. However, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator position below 50 is concerning. Despite its higher highs suggesting growing momentum, its position below 50 hints that bears continue to overpower the bulls. Accordingly, the resistance at $1.6972 may hold, and the ASTER price is likely to be rejected at this level. Such a move could extend the consolidation, potentially setting another lower low for the DEX token around the $1.4000 psychological level.",BeInCrypto,2025-10-01T08:58:27Z,https://beincrypto.com/aster-dex-october-price-drops-15/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.496933,0.1686274509803922
"""Buffet Indicator"" gives worrying sign for economy","While the U.S. stock market has been on a generational bull run, with U.S. equities trading at record highs, observers have warned that a crash could be on the horizon and are pointing to one key metric that is now raising concerns. The ""Buffett Indicator,"" proposed by and named after the acclaimed investor and outgoing Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, divides the total market cap of publicly traded U.S. stocks by the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Doing so, as Buffett argued in 2001, can be used to gauge whether the stock market is overvalued or undervalued relative to the size of the wider economy. The Buffett Indicator ratio currently stands at 219 percent, according to financial analytics platform MacroMicro, surpassing both the long-term trend and the 200-percent threshold that Buffett has said indicates investors are ""playing with fire."" While some experts are skeptical of the value or predictive power of the Buffett Indicator, many have noted the growing disparity between ballooning equity valuations and the general size of the United States economy, which has been highlighted as a signal that the market's recent run could end in a significant correction. A major and widespread decline in equity valuations would result in losses for investors, as well as for the millions of Americans whose savings and retirement accounts are tied to the success of the U.S. stock market. Buffett first proposed the idea behind the Buffett Indicator in 2001, describing the stock market-to-GDP ratio as ""probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment."" Steven Hochberg, chief market analyst at Elliott Wave International, said that while the Buffett Indicator does not provide investors with any market-timing abilities, it offers ""an excellent sense of risk."" ""This measure is at a historic extreme, indicating that that probability is high, historically high, for poor future returns for the stock market,"" he told Newsweek. President Donald Trump has cited the growth of U.S. equities as one of his most significant accomplishments in his second term. The S&P 500 has been a particular source of enthusiasm, having risen around 13 percent in the year-to-date, and rallied over 30 percent since crashing in early April following the announcement of Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs."" However, Hochberg told Newsweek that, according to both the Buffett Indicator and Elliott Wave's own models, the market is showing signs of being ""in the very late stages of an advance,"" and that a major adjustment could be around the corner. ""The impending bear market may or may not start with a crash,"" he said. ""We do think the odds are good that it will contain a crash at some point, but our models indicate that it will ultimately be the largest bear market in generations."" Roger Ibbotson, professor emeritus in the Practice of Finance at Yale University's School of Management, said that the Buffett Indicator spiked before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, as well as before the 2022 bear market, but did not do so in the lead-up to 2008 or before the 1973-1974 crash. David Rosenberg, founder of the economic and market insights firm Rosenberg Research, similarly highlighted flaws with the gauge, including the use of GDP, which includes government sector activity that isn't tied to corporate profits or future earnings. However, he told Newsweek that the Buffett Indicator is ""one of a myriad of valuation metrics,"" pointing to an overvaluation of the equity market. David Lefkowitz, head of Equities Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNBC earlier this month: ""Growth in AI investment and adoption is likely to continue at a robust pace into 2026. So, we think all the signs are pointing to continued growth in earnings, and that's what we think is going to drive the market higher."" Rosenberg Research founder David Rosenberg told Newsweek: ""I don't see a crash, but I do believe the market is way overpriced and too much AI-driven growth is being discounted. I am expecting negative surprises on this front to minimally generate the conditions for a steep market correction."" Analysts are split on how long the stock market will continue on its bull run and what scale of correction might follow. As for what could burst the bubble, Rosenberg cited several factors, including ""a renewed inflation scare,"" companies missing earnings forecasts, as well as the current weaknesses in the labor market, ""morphing into an outright recession.""",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/buffet-indicator-worrying-sign-economy-10805646,2025-10-01 17:27:04.497566,0.01960784313725483

Taxd offers a user-friendly, affordable solution that empowers taxpayers to file their returns efficiently and accurately. By automating much of the process and providing expert guidance, Taxd significantly reduces the time and cost associated with tax preparation.

PSU Fayette seeks new home for 'family history' of artifacts at coal and coke center,"A display inside the Coal and Coke Heritage Center at Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus near Uniontown depicts a typical company-owned store in a coal mining town. Goods purchased by a miner and his family would be deducted from his paycheck. In the basement of the library at Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus a few miles north of Uniontown, sits one of the largest collection of artifacts of the region's bituminous coal and coke-producing industries. The fate of the 48-year-old Coal and Coke Heritage Center and its 8,000 artifacts and extensive exhibits is unknown as the Fayette campus is scheduled to close at the end of the 2026-27 academic year. ""I want to make sure it is cared for and preserved ... and make sure it will get the best preservation. We are not throwing anything away,"" said Abby Tancin, who has been archivist at the center since 2022. A committee of five university officials is compiling a list of potential sites for the heritage center, but there is no deadline for making that decision, Tancin said. They want the Coal and Coke Heritage Center to remain in the area. One of the challenges will be to find a place that is climate-controlled for the artifacts, Tancin said, so the items in storage do not become moldy. If the Penn State campus is sold to another educational institution, it could remain on the campus, said Tancin, who is a Penn State employee overseeing a center funded by endowments and donations. ""We'll have to wrap it up in 2027,"" Tancin said, adding the university has not said whether the center's closure will coincide with the final graduation ceremony that spring. Until then, visitors will get to see the fruits of a two-year $8,000 renovation completed this summer. Tancin oversaw a change in center from more text-filled exhibits to one with more photos and signage. The library had been closed for renovations and the center had been closed from 2023 to this past summer, Tancin said The center offers a glimpse of a miner's family life, the company store where they spent their paycheck for food and clothing, what they wore on the job and tools they used. A coal-fired kitchen stove and a curio cabinet came from a family's home in a Fayette coal patch town, Tancin said. There is a replica garden with the vegetables that families would preserve and miners' lunch buckets at a model store owned by the coal company, which deducted their purchases from their paychecks. There are historical photos of the United Mine Workers of America from a century ago, featuring longtime leader John L. Lewis and delegates to a union convention. One display case of photos related to one of the darkest days of the union -- the UMWA-engineered assassination of former union leader Joseph ""Jock"" Yablonksi, his wife and daughter, on New Year's Eve 1969 at their home in Clarksville, Washington County. The display contains photos of the state police at the Yablonski house, the bodies being placed in a hearse and a packed church at the funeral. The UMWA president at the time of Yablonski's murder, W.A. ""Tony"" Boyle, was found guilty of conspiring to murder Yablonski and his family. The center also has some 1,800 oral histories and documents -- such as maps and photographs, Tancin said. There isn't enough room to show the three storage rooms full of more artifacts, she said. Tancin said they will reach out to as many families that donated artifacts as possible, to see what they want to do with their donations. The staff realizes how important the artifacts are to the families that have been donated to the center for the past decades. ""This is family history. This is generational history,"" Tancin said. Center beginnings The Coal and Coke Heritage Center began in 1977 as an outgrowth of an oral history project overseen by professors Dennis Brestensky, who has retired, and the late Evelyn Hovanec. The students brought back boxes of mining artifacts from fathers, grandfathers and other family members who were miners. Families had held onto the items for so long and no longer knew what to do with the items, Tancin said. One organization that may have some space for the artifacts is the Fayette County Historical Society, which is creating a coal mining exhibit at its 98-year-old Fairview School along Route 40 in the Menallen village of Haddenville, said Christine Buckelew, president of the county historical society. Buckelew said the society hopes to have the coal mining exhibit open by the end of the year. In the meantime, historical society members have expressed concern about the fate of the Coal and Coke Heritage Center, but the organization has not been approached about possibly housing the collection. ""We certainly will do the best we can to make it possible"" if asked to become the new home for the Coal and Coke Heritage Center, Buckelew said. The school, once a part of the Uniontown School District, will house the hundreds of artifacts, primarily from the late 1800s through the 1920s, that were donated to the historical society, Buckelew said. ""Any and all opportunities should be explored"" to keep the heritage center in Fayette County, Buckelew said. ""We care about it. It would be so much of a loss,"" Buckelew said of the loss of the heritage center and the campus.",TribLIVE,2025-10-01T09:01:00Z,https://triblive.com/local/regional/psu-fayette-seeks-new-home-for-family-history-of-artifacts-at-coal-and-coke-center/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.500052,0.06666666666666665
The consulting giant that creates more Fortune 500 chiefs than anyone else | Fortune,"Good morning. McKinsey is best known as a consulting powerhouse, but its quieter distinction is as a leadership factory -- a point I explore in my latest piece for Fortune. No other organization has minted more sitting Fortune 500 chiefs, with a global roster that includes Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, and Allianz's Oliver Bäte. The tally stands at 18 current Fortune 500 CEOs and 28 worldwide. For companies serious about succession, the question isn't just why McKinsey has this record, but how to emulate it to strengthen internal pipelines. The firm's method is as rigorous as it is intentional, more than a dozen former and current McKinsey alumni told me. From day one, new consultants rotate across industries, geographies, and functions, adapting on the fly and mastering unfamiliar businesses. They are expected to deconstruct sprawling problems, craft solutions, and win over skeptical executives -- often while still in their 20s. That early exposure to high-stakes decision-making accelerates judgment and builds the confidence boards later crave in C-suite leaders, according to consultants-turned-CEOs. Equally critical is McKinsey's culture of constructive dissent. Hierarchy matters less than ideas, and consultants are trained to challenge assumptions and present counterarguments, even to senior partners or client CEOs. This discipline, debating until the best idea survives, teaches future leaders to welcome scrutiny, pressure-test their own reasoning, and make tough calls with limited information. And the firm's veterans are not afraid to dissent either. When McKinsey faced bruising controversies in recent years -- from its work with opioid manufacturers to a bribery scandal in South Africa -- it was often alumni who raised the loudest alarms. ""They care deeply about the firm's role in the world,"" says Shelley Stewart, a senior partner who also helps oversee alumni engagement, ""and they will tell us when we've failed to live up to the standard we claim."" For those in their early to mid-career, relentless feedback deepens the learning. Reviews are frequent, unsparing, and are paired with coaching from senior partners and an ""up-or-out"" model that demands growth or exit. Those who rise acquire a habit of continuous improvement and the resilience to thrive under scrutiny. In a market where a succession misstep can wipe out billions in value, McKinsey offers a blueprint for building a self-renewing leadership engine: move high potentials through multiple businesses to develop range and pattern recognition early. Give emerging leaders real authority quickly by assigning stretch tasks that carry visible stakes. Make feedback and coaching a constant, not a formality. And create an environment where dissent is expected, so future leaders develop the muscle to debate strategy and own the outcome.Read the full article here. -- Ruth Umoh Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com The U.S. government has shut down Congress failed to reach an agreement about a spending bill and now thousands of federal employees will stop work and go on temporary furlough.

"India News | Stop Civilian Killings, Surrender: Chhattisgarh Dy CM Vijay Sharma Amid Naxal Attacks Against Teaching Volunteers | LatestLY","Sukma (Chhattisgarh) [India], October 1 (ANI): Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma on Wednesday asked the Naxalites who are attacking teaching volunteers and hindering education in the State to stop civilian killings and surrender. As Volunteer teachers, known as 'Shikshadoots,' are unable to access the Nav Gurukuls established by the CRPF, due to Naxal threats in Bastar, Vijay Sharma said that if the left-wing extremists want to hold talks with the government, they will have to stop the violence.

He told ANI, ""Shame on those Naxalites who slit the throats of village teachers and then talk nonsense. If they want to work with the government to reach a consensus, they should stop all this.

Teachers were attacked and intimidated as they worked as volunteers for education in the rural areas. A major attack on the volunteer in Silger in Chhattisgarh has led to fear among the teachers.

He said, ""Due to the recent campaign launched against the CPM (Maoist) organisation, Maoist groups are on the back foot. Their numbers are decreasing, and their influence is shrinking. Frustration from this has led these groups to target innocent volunteers working in rural education, committing acts like killings and intimidation."" Calling the Maoist organisations ""anti-development"", the IG assured the public of strict action against the attacks on the volunteers. ""This reveals the anti-development face of the Maoist organisation. Such actions do not show their strength but their weakness. We plan to identify and take strict action against all those responsible for attacks on volunteers. Additionally, we will make a special effort to ensure the safety of these volunteers,"" he said. The 'Shikshadoots' are frightened after one of the volunteers was attacked by the Naxalites. Shikshadoot Imla Bandhu said, ""The children take great interest in their studies... After what happened to one of our companions, we also felt scared because I received a warning. That's why an atmosphere of fear has already developed. A total of five people have been murdered recently. The whole area is scared now."" Another Shikshadoot has requested the District Collector for a safe space after receiving a warning from the Naxalites. ""The children learned from the government-provided books and were very interested in their studies... Now, due to the incident in Silger involving my friend, I am unable to go there... I also spoke with the collector and informed him that I am experiencing some difficulties going there. Having received a warning once before, I am feeling scared... I requested the collector to provide me with a safe place,"" he said. Seven schools were recently approved by the State government, and Nav Gurukuls are being established by the CRPF to promote education in Naxal-affected areas, the District Collector Devesh Kumar Dhruv said. Devesh Kumar Dhruv told ANI, ""As camps are being established in inner areas, education is also being continuously expanded. Seven schools have been recently approved by the government, and Nav Gurukuls are also being established by the CRPF. The CRPF is also paying the teachers' salaries from its own funds...

Toward Regulatory Harmonization: SEC and CFTC Seek Unified Framework for Innovation - Traders Magazine,"On Monday, September 29, 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) held a joint roundtable in Washington, D.C., focusing on regulatory harmonization between the two agencies. The event came after a joint statement from SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins and CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham, emphasizing a commitment to aligning regulatory frameworks to reduce investor costs and expand market choice. ""It is a new day at the SEC and the CFTC, and today we begin a long-awaited journey to provide markets the clarity they deserve,"" the chairs said in their joint statement. They highlighted the potential benefits of working together, from harmonizing product definitions and streamlining reporting requirements to coordinating innovation exemptions under existing authorities. The roundtable brought together regulators, industry leaders, and market experts to explore how closer cooperation could tackle longstanding regulatory challenges and enhance market efficiency. One of the panels, moderated by former CFTC Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo and former SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes, featured industry leaders including Stephen Berger (Citadel), Ryan Louvar (WisdomTree), Nick Lundgren (Crypto.com), JB Mackenzie (Robinhood Markets), Dave Olsen (Jump Trading Group), Sonali Theisen (Bank of America), and Brad Tully (J.P. Morgan). Louvar of WisdomTree underscored the ongoing jurisdictional challenges between the SEC and CFTC, particularly in defining digital assets: ""As a registered fund provider with investments in commodity interests, we've had to navigate two bifurcated regulatory regimes. Former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo pointed out the discrepancies in data reporting requirements: ""The CFTC wants 132 data fields, the SEC 148, and overseas regulators up to 227 -- with no alignment whatsoever,"" he said. Giancarlo advocated for blockchain-based solutions that could allow regulators to monitor transactions in real time, effectively transforming the post-trade reporting regime into a streamlined, transparent system. Jump Trading Group' Olsen highlighted how decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and oracles -- trusted data feeds for smart contracts -- are already solving data problems. ""Oracles aggregate real-world data to power trading models, and this space is wide open for further development,"" he noted. The panel agreed that U.S. markets need to evolve toward 24/7 trading to keep pace with global markets and emerging digital assets. Lundgren of Crypto.com advocated for the U.S. to embrace 24/7 markets, stating: ""If there's a market for it, people should be able to trade it anytime. Markets like crypto and FX already operate 24/7 efficiently."" Robinhood Markets's Mackenzie emphasized that market participants today are equipped to handle around-the-clock trading with proper staffing and technology. Sonali from Bank of America highlighted the importance of sequencing innovation with investor protection. ""We need to ensure the ecosystem is ready and aligned to operate safely before moving markets to 24/7 trading,"" she said. Louvar pointed out that trading is only half the equation; ""settlement must also evolve"". ""It's about immediate settlement too. Blockchain offers a way to settle trades transparently and at low cost, benefiting end investors."" Olsen added that stablecoins are often viewed as a key solution for settling trades outside traditional Fed wire hours. However, he cautioned against the asymmetry in how stablecoins are treated compared to treasuries, calling for more clarity and regulatory frameworks. Tully from JPMorgan agreed, emphasizing the need for ""regulatory wrappers"" around extended trading hours and settlement mechanisms, including central bank facilities to manage risk. Former SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes introduced the concept of harmonization, noting that it can take many forms, from aligning rulebooks and processes to improving interagency communication. Tully suggested reviving joint advisory committees between the SEC and CFTC as a concrete step to foster collaboration and create actionable recommendations. Sonali advocated for formalized public-private partnerships to tackle key issues like blockchain definitions, investor protection, and record keeping. ""A punch list of topics prioritized by sequence could help drive focused debate and coordinated action,"" she said. Meanwhile, Mackenzie emphasized the need for deadlines to spur progress: ""If there's never a timeline, the status quo persists. We need to set goals, like moving to 24/7 trading, and let innovators lead the way while bringing incumbents along."" He also noted that international markets are moving quickly, and the U.S. risks losing competitiveness if it lags. Sonali added that while rapid innovation is critical, it must be balanced with safeguards to prevent unintended consequences. ""Sequencing is key,"" she said. The discussion highlighted a shared recognition among regulators and market participants that innovation in financial markets is inevitable and accelerating. However, aligning regulatory frameworks -- between the SEC, CFTC, and globally -- and building infrastructure to support 24/7 trading, immediate settlement, and real-time transparency will require deliberate, coordinated efforts. This roundtable represented a tangible step toward the vision laid out in the joint statement by Chairman Atkins and Acting Chairman Pham. They framed the initiative as ""a pivotal step toward building more coherent and competitive U.S. markets."" ""By working together to align our regulatory frameworks, the SEC and CFTC can reduce unnecessary barriers, enhance market efficiency, and create space for innovation to thrive,"" they said.",Traders Magazine,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/featured_articles/toward-regulatory-harmonization-sec-and-cftc-seek-unified-framework-for-innovation/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.501909,0.411764705882353

Uttarakhand CM Launches Free Ambulance Service for Senior Citizens on International Day of Older Persons,"Dehradun: Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday attended the state-level program organised at the Himalayan Cultural Centre, Dehradun, on the occasion of International Day of Older Persons where he flagged off a free ambulance van dedicated to the service of senior citizens, as well as a senior citizens' walkathon rally. He extended his best wishes to all senior citizens of the state on this special day. On the occasion, the Chief Minister felicitated elderly citizens and administered the ""Senior Citizen Honour Pledge."" He also planted a sapling in his mother's name as part of the event. Addressing the gathering, he said that senior citizens are the pillars of our society, whose blessings and experience serve as a guiding light for all. He emphasised that both the state and central governments are making continuous efforts to ensure the dignity, security, health, and welfare of the elderly through various schemes. He highlighted several welfare initiatives, including the Atal Vayo Abhyuday Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana, Rashtriya Vayoshree Yojana, and the Old Age Pension Scheme. He informed that pension amounts are being directly transferred to the bank accounts of nearly six lakh elderly beneficiaries in the state through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer). The Chief Minister further stated that the infrastructure and facilities at old age homes across the state are being continuously strengthened. Government-run old age homes are already operational in Bageshwar, Chamoli, and Uttarkashi districts, while new buildings are under construction in Dehradun, Almora, and Champawat. With the support of the central government, a model old-age home is also being built in Rudrapur, Udham Singh Nagar. The process to establish old age homes in Rudraprayag, Tehri, Pauri, and Pithoragarh districts is also underway. He added that under the Geriatric Caregiver Training Program, specialists are being trained to take care of senior citizens. The state aims to train 150 master trainers and caregivers this year. Under the Rashtriya Vayoshree Yojana, assistive devices are being provided to senior citizens. A target has been set to conduct free cataract surgeries for 1,300 elderly individuals this year. The Chief Minister also highlighted that the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act has been implemented in the state to safeguard the rights of senior citizens.",KalingaTV,2025-10-01T08:52:46Z,https://kalingatv.com/nation/uttarakhand-cm-launches-free-ambulance-service-for-senior-citizens-on-international-day-of-older-persons/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.502478,0.4666666666666666
China's EV supremacy raises national security concerns for the US,"The electric vehicle revolution is often framed as a climate imperative -- a way to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming. But the race to electrify automotive fleets is not just about the transportation sector: EVs are the gateway to a new military-industrial era. And China is already winning. While the U.S. dithers over charging stations and trade restrictions, China has built a vertically integrated EV empire -- dominating production, supply chains and the underlying technologies that will define the next century. This isn't just about cars. It's about batteries that power everything from smartphones to drones to autonomous weapons. It means building the kind of deep R&D pipelines that can be redirected toward military technologies. It means dominance in AI navigation, robotics and smart cities. It's about who will control the infrastructure of the future -- and who could win future wars. ""A healthy, innovative auto sector drives industrial power far beyond cars,"" David Feith, former deputy assistant secretary at the State Department, told Newsweek. ""It's crucial for scale and the downstream flow of innovations."" Today's Chinese EVs are computers on wheels, equipped for the digital age with infotainment systems and touchscreens and high-tech features like rotating passenger seats and a weird gimmick that lets cars ""dance"" or shake to music. Some models even sport a roof-mounted drone that motorists can launch off the car to record video by remote control. If America fails to lead (or even compete) in the EV space, it won't just miss its climate targets -- it will forfeit its industrial base, hollow out its manufacturing heartland and turn Detroit, once the symbol of American ingenuity, into a legacy domestic supplier of gasoline-powered pickups. In short, the United States stands to lose the technological edge that made it a superpower while the rest of the world zooms past. ""If the U.S. doesn't invest in new mobility innovations, hundreds of jobs and market share will vanish for good, along with a major shift in wealth,"" warned Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. The EV race is not just a matter of mobility. It's about sovereignty. China's bold move into electric vehicles began in 2009 as a top-down policy to compete with foreign automakers, cut air pollution and reduce oil imports. Spurred by subsidies and incentives and its vast industrial production capabilities, China leapfrogged over manufacturing gasoline-powered cars and rocketed to become the world's largest EV manufacturer with more than 70 percent of global production today, according to the International Energy Agency. Electric car sales are set to exceed 20 million vehicles worldwide this year; China will make 14 million or two-thirds of them. The next EV leap is expected by 2030, the IEA forecasts, when EVs reach 40 percent of total auto sales globally. But in 2024, EVs were already more than half of autos sold in China and could reach 60 percent this year. By comparison, in the U.S., one in 10 cars sold were EVs in 2024, IEA figures show, and only modest growth is expected this decade. Even so, the U.S. still depends on its conventional auto industry as an anchor to both economic and geopolitical might. After all, auto factories supplied weapons during World War II and still could. Absent action by American leadership to narrow the EV gap with China by investing in its own competitiveness, China's scale and velocity in industrial tech and support of EV adoption could cause U.S. automakers to become ""increasingly irrelevant,"" technology forecaster Paul Saffo told Newsweek. ""If the U.S. doesn't transition to new energy vehicles quickly,"" said auto industry expert Michael Dunne of Dunne Insights, ""Detroit will cede the global market and be reduced to a niche supplier of gas-powered pickup trucks and SUVs."" The hard truth? ""We are sitting on an island of ICE [internal combustion engines], rapidly moving back into the 1950s of Detroit with big boomer cars while the rest of the world is moving forward with electric vehicles,"" said John Zysman, professor emeritus at UC Berkeley and cofounder and codirector of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. It may be too late to push back the march of Chinese EVs. China's appealing and cost-competitive electric cars are gaining substantial market share in European markets like the U.K. and France and are up to 85 percent of EV sales in Brazil and nearly two-thirds in Mexico. Such growth is fueled by China's low labor costs, well-developed component supply chain, fiercely competitive and crowded manufacturing sector and government subsidies, which have combined to lower average EV prices by about 10 percent over the last five years to about $26,000, on par with ICE vehicles. Rather than trying to keep up, the U.S. is increasingly trying to keep China's EVs out. This year, the U.S. restricted the import and sale of Chinese internet-connected electric vehicles citing national security concerns, such as spying on drivers, recording images of infrastructure or transmitting data back to Beijing. The Biden administration announced more than $170 billion worth of investments to foster domestic EV auto production. But now, the outlook for EVs in the U.S. has dimmed due to recent policy shifts under President Donald Trump. The One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, and after Trump's pause on a $5 billion program for states to build out their electric charging station networks was overturned by the courts, the future of the program remains uncertain. Ineffective policies for the EV market could mirror the loss of the solar energy industry, says Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, where too-late action left America outpaced and China controlling more than 80 percent of the world's solar panels. If the U.S. poorly manages the transition to EVs, it could trigger high unemployment and poverty in Rust Belt and Sun Belt manufacturing hubs. EVs have fewer parts than gasoline engines and automated assembly plants don't need as many workers. They also don't need the same workers: EV factory employees need to be proficient in running electrical systems, safely handling high-voltage components and programming and maintaining robots -- not exactly Henry Ford's assembly line operators. In the 20th century, America's dominance of the private car industry reshaped its economy, landscape, cities and global influence. The individually owned automobile made possible by Ford's advances in mass production in the early part of the century unlocked the forces that transformed the country following World War II, including encouraging workforce mobility, fueling suburban expansion, catalyzing the steel and petroleum industries and supercharging consumer culture. ""The leapfrog of the American economy in the past was because of private cars,"" Uri Levine, cofounder of Waze, told Newsweek. That dominance didn't just build wealth -- it built geopolitical power. Today, China is replicating that model with electric vehicles, and the second-order benefits are already cascading: smarter cities, stronger supply chains and a growing lead in AI navigation, robotics and battery technology. If the U.S. fails to keep pace, it won't just lose the EV market -- it will lose the foundation for the next generation of industrial and military innovation. ""Now, as U.S. mobility innovations stall, we are starting to get stuck, and that is going to slow us down economically,"" Levine warned. China's huge industrial market and modernized infrastructure provide an unparalleled base for its EVs to go mainstream. Chinese EV brands outdo gas-powered vehicles on driving distance and some new models are almost as fast at refueling, with batteries that can be swapped out in under five minutes. This lead is driven by China's extensive electric charging network, with nearly 10 million charging stations as of May 2025 and growing 56 percent year-on-year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. This year, Beijing alone plans to build 1,000 ultra-fast charging stations, which can provide 250 miles of driving in a five-minute stop, while the megacity Chongqing is adding 4,000 ultra-fast chargers. By contrast, the U.S. has approximately 76,000 charging stations, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, with Tesla accounting for 54 percent of fast chargers and building out more supercharger sites with multiple ports, two of them in California. As China's climb with EVs continues, this knowhow has spilled over into other next-generation industries. ""Over the past 15 years, China has climbed the value chain -- starting with electronics then leveraging that expertise to expand and capture more global production,"" Robert D. Atkinson, founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, told Newsweek. ""Economists call this cumulative causation: Gains in one sector fuel advances in others. That's exactly what the Chinese have been doing."" This domino effect could lead China to leverage its dominance in EVs to yield innovations ahead of the West. For instance, EV maker NIO, boosted by investments from Chinese province Anhui, developed battery-swapping stations to exchange depleted batteries for recharged ones within minutes. Modeled on mobile data plans, subscription plans for battery-as-a-service for leased EV batteries have sprung up in China. In the electrified city of the future, parking spaces could be converted into lots for ridesharing and robotaxis, supercharging stations and dedicated bike lanes, said Kara Kockelman, professor of transportation engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Increased adoption of EVs leads to more autonomous driving shuttles, better urban planning, reduced traffic congestion and less air pollution. This future is already arriving in digitized cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. Thanks to China's favorable governmental policies, scale and a robust infrastructure, compared with a fragmented regulatory and hesitant approach in the U.S., China stands to also gain a competitive advantage in the autonomous vehicle market and the AI navigation capabilities to power it, said John Helveston, an associate professor at George Washington University's engineering management department. Baidu's Apollo Go, a Chinese autonomous driving leader, has rolled out robotaxi services across many Chinese cities, far ahead of the progress of Alphabet's Waymo, the primary player in the U.S., while General Motors canceled its money-losing Cruise robotaxi service in 2024. Tesla is still in the early stages of testing. ""Five years from now, I'd bet on a Chinese company figuring out how to make a fully autonomous car that can out-compete even Waymo today because there's this industrial ecosystem all around it,"" Helveston predicted. Whatever the future standards are for EVs, it will be the market leader who sets them. This is already playing out with the technical charging standards for electric plugs. Currently, the North American standard is modeled on the Tesla charge post, which GM, Ford, Rivian and other U.S. automakers have adopted. Europe requires a different standard for fast charging. China has its own ultra-fast system, which Tesla relies on for the Chinese market. Meanwhile, a new high-power plug with a lightweight, smaller connector design, called ChaoJi, is being tested in China and Japan. China's vast EV market and extended supply chain network provides the additional benefit of vertical integration. Chinese EV leader BYD, for example, has streamlined operations by bringing parts for assembly under one factory roof, which can improve quality control and speed up R&D cycles. BYD even owns a shipping fleet of six vessels which can each carry 9,200 vehicles, providing better control of the timing and costs of its distribution routes. It's been a generation -- 36 years -- since Ford operated a shipping fleet, and that was for transporting iron and coal across the Great Lakes to Dearborn, Michigan. Another advantage for China in this new EV age: It is technology entrepreneurs, not incumbent automakers, who are leading the industry's disruptive changes. EV makers like Xiaomi (which first made smartphones), XPENG and NIO began as tech startups during China's internet boom of the 2010s. Supported by leading private equity investors from China and the West, they raised large amounts of capital, went public on Hong Kong and New York exchanges and carved out strong leads in China. By contrast, GM and Ford have joint ventures with Chinese partners that are often state-owned enterprises established some 25 years ago, and today, are experiencing shrinking influence and market shares. A pressing issue in the realm of EVs is dual-use technologies for commercial and military purposes. ""Military-civil fusion has exploded in recent years with the evolution of technology,"" national security expert Feith explained, and advances in commercial sectors can feed directly into defense capabilities. Leadership in batteries, robotics and automation brings economies of scale and deep R&D pipelines that can be redirected toward military use. ""Today, the United States is increasingly reliant on foreign adversaries for the minerals, technologies and supply chains that will drive economic growth, enhance energy security and strengthen the national defense,"" retired Admiral Jonathan Greenert, co-chair of SAFE's Energy Security Leadership Council, wrote in a recent report, ""The Pillars of Power."" ""The stakes could not be higher. The decisions made today will determine whether the United States reasserts and secures its position as the world's leading economic and technological power or continues to cede ground in industries critical to its future,"" he concluded, urging coordinated action to restore America's industrial base, secure critical supply chains, modernize the electric gird and strengthen national defense through energy and technological leadership to avoid future trade and tech conflicts reminiscent of Middle East regimes' leverage over oil. China has gained a lead in batteries and is aiming for dominance in robotics and next-generation AI-powered manufacturing. The battlefield applications of these fields are already being demonstrated. Drones equipped with advanced batteries and sensors can fly longer, avoid obstacles and maneuver into swarm tactics that can win battles, such as with Ukraine's recent coordinated, long-range drone attack into Russia known as ""Spider Web."" EV self-driving systems can be adapted for military use to autonomously guide unmanned tanks, transport supplies and patrol areas. Efficient, high-torque electric motors can be repurposed for precise navigation and dexterity for military strikes. Sensors and AI technologies used in connected passenger vehicles can be transferred to use in warfare to improve battlefield monitoring and navigation of military equipment. The batteries that power next-generation military technologies -- drones, humanoid robots, AI navigation -- are at the heart of the U.S.-China competition for industrial and technological leadership. Drones and batteries are currently dominated by giant Chinese tech companies: Shenzhen-based drone maker DJI, privately held and largely owned by its billionaire founder Frank Wang, and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, or CATL, an EV-focused battery spinoff of the Japanese electronics giant TDK founded by Robin Zeng. U.S. fears that DJI drones could beam sensitive images back to China previously led to a ban on their use in the U.S. military. The Commerce Department has choked off its supply of U.S. chips and sensors, and the Treasury has blacklisted the firm from American investment. And yet, DJI accounts for 70 percent of global drone sales. Located in Fujian province, CATL is the world's largest maker of lithium-ion batteries and supplies Tesla and Volkswagen in China. CATL claims roughly half of China's battery market and more than one-third worldwide, and it's now pushing into the U.S., raising concerns about a Chinese supplier that can power everything from EVs to defense systems. Achieving cost parity with China for batteries requires production at scale, and that scale depends on strong, sustained demand for EVs, the largest battery consumer. Without it, the U.S. risks relying heavily on China for the very power source that underpins future technologies critical to national security and defense. ""This would mean deep reliance on, and vulnerability to, China,"" said Dunne. CATL recently struck a licensing deal with Ford to supply battery technology for a new $3.5 billion Ford-owned plant in Michigan. The move quickly drew scrutiny from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which questioned Ford's reliance on Chinese technology, minerals and workers. CATL's U.S. ambitions face another hurdle: In January, the Pentagon blacklisted the company over alleged ties to China's military -- a charge CATL denies. China's dominance in electric vehicles is also boosting its robotics sector. While the U.S. has achieved an early lead in robotics innovation, it lags in large-scale production with no U.S. firm currently mass-producing industrial robots. Meanwhile China, which has widely deployed robotics in its vast manufacturing sector, announced a $138 billion investment in robotics and AI under its Made in China 2025 policy aiming to close the technical gap and establish itself as a global leader in advanced manufacturing. Ultimately, America's culture of innovation is a decisive advantage that China has struggled to replicate. Chinese engineers excel at copying and refining Western advances, but true disruptive invention remains harder to come by. Beijing is catching up, as shown by the sudden rise of AI startup DeepSeek. In this massive auto industry shift, GM and Ford vehicles are holding on to global market shares of about 9 percent and 6 percent. Quite the change from the 1960s, when the Big Three automakers dominated and China made hardly any cars. Today in China, American-made gas-powered models -- a source of profits and access to suppliers for U.S. automakers -- are quickly being sidelined in the world's fastest-growing EV market. In 2024, GM sales in China dropped 14 percent and, for the first nine months of the year, its market share there declined from 8.6 percent to 6.8 percent, down from 15 percent in the mid-2010s. In the first six months of 2025, the automaker posted a rebound, with sales rising 9.4 percent, boosted by momentum in its new energy vehicles. However, a shake-out is coming in China's dynamic EV market. More than 100 brands currently compete with one another, leading to steep discounts and price wars. Only 15 Chinese EV makers are expected to emerge from this boom, predicts consultancy AlixPartners. Not surrendering, in the U.S., GM and Ford have pledged upward of $90 billion to build battery plants and convert old factories that will begin operating within three to five years -- a long time in the fast-moving EV market. The Detroit automakers have enjoyed some notable EV wins in pickups (F-150 and Silverado) and SUVs (Equinox and Mustang Mach EV). Tesla has been in a sales slump this year but still claims about half of EV sales in the U.S. And don't count out America's world-leading culture of innovation. Two San Diego-based firms, South 8 Technologies and UNIGRID, have each landed $12 million in strategic funding and dozens of patents for longer-lasting, faster-charging battery technologies that could accelerate the adoption of EVs. Tesla had a first-mover advantage in China in 2013, leveraging the government's support of EVs with subsidies and incentives and its production base and opening a gigafactory in Shanghai in 2019. China became Tesla's number one market in sales and its biggest production and export hub. Tesla is still regarded by the Chinese as a premium brand, and its Model 3, at around $33,000, is pricier than comparable Chinese makes such as the Xiaomi SU7 sedan at $30,400. But Tesla has recently been discounting in the highly competitive Chinese market as well. And its prestige image started to fade as snazzy new Chinese EV makers emerged and Tesla's lineup needed a refresher (a new, roomier six-seater Model Y had a successful launch in August). While chalking up 8.8 percent growth last year, Tesla's share of the Chinese market fell to 6 percent down from 15 percent in 2020. Moreover BYD, which Warren Buffett had backed in 2008, surpassed Tesla as the top global EV seller in 2024 and keeps widening its sales lead. ""The Chinese EV makers are advanced and are innovating at the cutting edge, and Tesla needs to be able to keep up with that,"" said China and tech policy expert Paul Triolo, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based business advisory firm DGA Group. ""China has an advantage because they have the supply chain for EVs, particularly rare earth minerals and batteries -- and a big advantage in costs."" There are still plenty of unknowns about the progression of EV technology. Other disruptive technologies of the future could dent their incline. ""It's quixotic to believe that electric will be the model of all vehicles,"" said tech futurist George Gilder, adding that he foresees ""a strong role for emerging renewable energy, hydrogen-powered vehicles."" However, the second-order impacts of a global automotive realignment are already playing out. Shortages of rare earth minerals idled Detroit production lines earlier this year and only eased after the U.S. made a deal with China to lift export restrictions of certain chip design software. To avoid further supply line pinches like this, GM recently struck a long-term deal with Noveon Magnetics, whose San Marcos, Texas, facility is the only rare earth magnet manufacturer in the United States. Over the past two decades, China has risen from imitator to innovator, advancing rapidly in new energy, robotics, batteries and drones -- and related military power. ""We can't block China from technology,"" Jim McGregor, chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, told Newsweek. ""We can slow them down a bit, but we need to figure out how to get along and de-risk it.""",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/chinas-ev-supremacy-raises-national-security-concerns-for-the-us-10799968,2025-10-01 17:27:04.504482,0.09019607843137245

XPL Price Drops 46% Amid FUD  --  Can It Recover From Here?,"Charts show broken bullish structure, but $1.11 support could enable recovery once FUD fades and ICO sell pressure eases. XPL FUD has recently become the center of attention as the token's price dropped more than 46% from its all-time high (ATH) in just a few days. The causes stem from rumors, ICO profit-taking pressure, and volatile market sentiment. The key question now is whether this is merely a short-term correction or a sign of a prolonged downtrend. Data from BeInCrypto shows that Plasma's XPL price is trading around $0.9235, down 46% from its ATH three days ago. The sharp decline of XPL originated from claims that Plasma ""was developed by the same team as Blast,"" a highly controversial project. Since its launch in late 2023, Blast has faced numerous incidents, including hacks, rug pulls, network outages, a lack of transparency in development, and heated debates over token distribution and airdrops. As a result, XPL's price fell from $1.7 to $0.9 before recovering to current levels. However, some analysts have affirmed that this was merely baseless, even organized FUD, spread to create artificial selling pressure. This highlights an important reality: the crypto market is driven by supply and demand and highly vulnerable to manipulation through one-sided information. ""After deep research and my personal connections in Bitfinex it was confirmed that this is just organized FUD with zero evidence,"" one X user commented. Aside from FUD about the team, another reason is the unlocking of ICO tokens. Many early investors had gained 20x - 30x profits in just a few months, leading them to take profits. This caused a sudden surge in market supply, contributing to the price decline. According to crypto trader Alex Kruger's observations, abnormal funding rates combined with large spot selling volumes indicate that the drop was mostly due to ""spot dumping"" rather than a short squeeze. This is characteristic of a market undergoing correction after a hot rally, not necessarily due to a fundamental change. ""Expect a strong move up as soon as indiscriminate spot selling subsides, whenever that may be,"" an analyst noted. It seems that the FUD-related information around XPL significantly impacted investor sentiment. On the 1-hour chart, XPL displayed the typical pattern of a newly launched token: a rapid pump followed by a sharp dump. The ~$1.11 zone is a crucial support level to regain short-term momentum. During the 4-hour timeframe, the market witnessed a streak of consecutive red candles, which precisely described a severe sell-off or ""vicious selling."" Some analyses suggest that XPL has lost its 4H trend and even broken down past the consolidation zone, weakening its bullish structure without showing any recovery attempts. XPL FUD has played a major role in fueling this pessimistic sentiment. The big question now: Is this a local bottom or the beginning of a longer-term downtrend? From a strategic standpoint, this is more likely a short-term bottom -- the price could rebound once ICO selling pressure cools off. XPL still has strong recovery potential if selling supply decreases and the community overcomes its fear of XPL FUD. However, if left unaddressed, XPL FUD may continue to erode confidence.",BeInCrypto,2025-10-01T08:40:14Z,https://beincrypto.com/xpl-crashes-amid-fud/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.505233,-0.2549019607843137
China launches visa to attract foreign tech talent,"China kicked off on Wednesday a new visa programme aimed at attracting foreign talent in science and technology, part of ongoing efforts to position itself as a world leader in those sectors ahead of the United States. The Chinese measure, announced in August, stands in stark contrast to recent US policy, with the Trump administration suddenly introducing new and expensive changes to its own skilled worker visas last month. China's new K visa significantly simplifies the immigration process for those eligible, according to state media. ""Against the backdrop of some countries retracting, turning inward, and sidelining international talent, China has keenly seized this important opportunity and promptly introduced this policy,"" state newspaper People's Daily said in a comment piece on Tuesday. In contrast to many other visa categories, the K visa does not require a domestic employer or entity to issue an invitation to the applicant. ""K visas will offer more convenience to holders in terms of number of permitted entries, validity period and duration of stay,"" state news agency Xinhua reported in August. The official description for those able to apply is ""young foreign scientific and technological talents"", but the exact age, educational background and work experience requirements needed are as yet unclear. Xinhua said visa-holders will be able to ""engage in exchanges in fields such as education, culture, and science and technology, as well as relevant entrepreneurial and business activities"". Across the Atlantic, the US tech industry has been rattled by unexpected changes made by the Trump administration to the H-1B visa procedure. H-1Bs allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills, such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers, to work in the United States for three years, with a possible extension to six. Such visas are widely used by the tech industry, but the new H-1B visa policy now requires a one-time $100,000 fee. Indian nationals account for nearly three-quarters of the permits allotted via a lottery system each year. The People's Daily article on Tuesday pushed back at what it called ""strange rumours"" around the new visa creating ""immigration problems"" in China. ""The so-called 'immigration crisis' will not materialise; we should have cultural confidence,"" it said.",The Guardian,2025-10-01T09:04:14Z,https://guardian.ng/news/china-launches-visa-to-attract-foreign-tech-talent/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.505459,0.2392156862745098

Athletes are a key hiring pool at Goldman Sachs  --  three employees from D-1 college programs explain why,"4 employees told BI why sports can be a leg up when trying to break into the influential bank. On the lacrosse field at Duke University, Madison Crutchfield's coach encouraged her to ""play fast, not hurried."" Today, that advice has become a guiding light in her job working on Goldman's fast-paced trading floor, where she says it applies to everything from executing an order to meeting a project deadline. ""That's really transferable in the world of sales and trading, where there's usually some 'game clock' ticking,"" said Crutchfield, a vice president in equity derivative sales at the behemoth bank. ""Having the ability to be efficient but not rushed is a critical edge."" Her story is emblematic of why athletes -- trained in grit, resilience, competition, and teamwork -- have become a key talent pipeline and recruiting pool for Goldman. The bank has even recruited beyond the college ranks, hiring former NFL star Justin Tuck in 2018 and promoting him to managing director in 2022. ""It is a way to differentiate yourself,"" Jacqueline Arthur, Goldman's head of human capital management, told Business Insider. ""These qualities are not just transferable but powerful and directly applicable to the dynamic environment of financial services."" Simply put: Being an athlete is a way to get a leg up and stand out in an increasingly competitive landscape. Goldman, for example, received more than 300,000 applications for its 2024 summer internships, leading to an acceptance rate of less than 1%. To understand why athletes tend to do well both getting into and ultimately working at Goldman, Business Insider spoke with Ryan Held, an Olympic swimmer who now works in Goldman's cyber risk group; Sara Naison-Tarajano, a partner in private wealth management and former Yale tennis captain, and Arthur and Crutchfield. They described how sports helped them land jobs at Goldman, what skills they developed in matches, games, and meets that have helped them in their demanding Wall Street careers, and why the firm views athletes as a competitive advantage. Crutchfield said being a student athlete gave her an edge when she was applying for sales and trading internships in college. ""Lacrosse conditioned in me a mindset and temperament that I leaned on throughout the networking, the application, and when it came to it, the interviewing stages,"" she said, ""I draw on these intangibles -- such as the need to think quickly on my feet, to stay resourceful, and to be a self-starter -- every day."" Wall Street hiring managers have long advised going into interviews with a hook -- something memorable that makes you stand out. The people who spoke to Business Insider for this story agreed that sports can play that role and demonstrate qualities you might need for the job. ""Grit, resilience, collaboration, leadership -- as we think about the different demonstrable ways that candidates could express these things, certainly we've seen success in this venue,"" Arthur said. Crutchfield took it a step further, explaining that the word ""athlete"" can also represent a cultural ideal at Goldman. ""We often talk about being an 'athlete' at the firm, not to point out employees who were former sports athletes per se, but really to describe teammates who are versatile leaders,"" she said, adding that it can also be used to describe someone who ""process of continual improvement make them a total weapon on the trading floor,"" Crutchfield said. ""In terms of mindset and work ethic, I would argue I've met so many more athletes at Goldman than I ever did playing sports,"" she said. Sara Naison-Tarajano's Goldman story began on the tennis courts at Yale. She planned to become a lawyer until conversations with friends and coaches -- including a bond trader she practiced with one summer -- pointed her toward Wall Street. ""People around me started to say, 'Look, you have some attributes that would be really interesting in this world,'"" she said. ""You are very focused. You work as hard as anyone. You're disciplined, you like to win, you're competitive."" Now, as a hiring manager and global head of private wealth management capital markets, Naison-Tarajano has also learned that athletes take direction like a champ. ""To be a good athlete, you have to be able to take very specific, very nuanced direction,"" she said. ""I think that translates well to most professional environments, but particularly something like Wall Street, where it's a bit of learning on the job."" It can also help with time management, said Held, a Division-1 swimmer at North Carolina State University who went on to win Olympic gold at the Rio Games in 2016 and competed again in 2024. ""When you're in college, you have to balance athletics, you have to balance academics, and then your own personal life,"" said Held. And it helps you deal with losing. ""A bad swim, bad season -- how do you bounce back?,"" said Held, adding, ""I think those are all great skills to have."" ""I think sports teach you how to win and lose,"" Crutchfield added. ""Seasons are marathons, not sprints, and you quickly learn not to get too high or too low -- staying even-keeled and patient is a must in order to stay focused."" Arthur said Goldman's interest in athletes is less of an explicit recruiting mandate and more of a pattern that has emerged as a byproduct of the qualities Goldman is looking for in young hires. ""We're not tracking if somebody's an athlete or not. We're tracking -- do we think that they have these qualities?"" she said. ""There are a lot of other ways to demonstrate strategic thinking, leadership, communication, collaboration, and teamwork,"" she said, adding, ""but this is one that's very attractive and clearly has gone on to serve these people incredibly well."" As Goldman hires more athletes, it can give other athletes an advantage in networking, which is how Held landed at Goldman Sachs. After the 2024 Olympics, he began to explore life beyond competitive swimming. Held reached out to a former high-level swimmer who works at Goldman for advice on transitioning from athletics to the corporate world. That person introduced him to two more Goldman employees, who shared more connections still. Eventually, the string of networking helped him understand more about different areas of the bank and land a job as an analyst in cyber risk. ""There is so much more to the bank. And it opened my eyes to, oh, maybe the financial sector is a place that I could work and pursue, so maybe I should do a little bit of research,"" he said.",Business Insider,2025-10-01T09:01:02Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-careers-hiring-athletes-grit-teamwork-interview-tips-careers-2025-9,2025-10-01 17:27:04.506207,0.3411764705882352
BrightDrop Is a Bright Spot for Commercial EVs,"AUSTINTOWN, Ohio - A new commercial van is among the latest models in Chevrolet's electric-vehicle portfolio to hit the streets, and it's already commanding the attention of customers in the Mahoning Valley. It helps that a Chevy BrightDrop 400 is situated front and center outside Greenwood Chevrolet's showroom along Mahoning Avenue in Austintown - a vehicle that stands out among a row of passenger vehicles. ""The BrightDrop is definitely getting the attention from our customers as they drive through here,"" says Kevin Lawson, leasing and sales consultant at Greenwood. ""We see these on the news, but to see one in Youngstown, Ohio, is pretty nice."" Lawson says the BrightDrop EV is a vehicle specifically targeted for use by small businesses. While the model at Greenwood is not for sale and is not available for test drives, those who are in the market for a commercial cargo van are able to get an upfront look at its size, layout, features and style, he says. ""It's geared toward a small business for in-town driving,"" Lawson says. ""Say a plumber or roofer. You can get in, take a look around, and see if it would make sense for your business needs."" One such businessman, a local contractor who installs gutters, stopped in recently to inquire about the van's features, especially the electrical outlets in the cargo area. The van would enable him to simply plug-in equipment such as an electric saw in the back of the vehicle, where he could then cut gutters to custom lengths. Greenwood's model is a 400 series, meaning it has 400 cubic feet of cargo space, Lawson notes. A larger model, the BrightDrop 600, allows for 600 cubic feet. Since the BrightDrop is an EV, a business owner doesn't need to worry about oil changes or transmission issues, says Lawson. The van also comes equipped with front and rear automatic braking, 360-degree cameras, as well as overhead images of the vehicle that are projected on the dashboard screen. ""It also has a low entry point,"" he says. ""You're not crawling or climbing into the back of the truck - you're stepping in. There are almost 20 safety features on this van that are standard."" Other amenities include a heated steering wheel, heated seats, heated mirrors and a jump seat in the front. ""There are a lot of luxury features for a commercial vehicle,"" he says. Among the biggest concerns among customers - and this is common across the board for potential EV buyers - is battery range, Lawson says. The BrightDrop 400 has a range of approximately 300 miles, which is ideal for local driving, he notes. Moreover, General Motors has placed a discount of up to $26,000 for qualified buyers on the BrightDrop that is effective until Sept. 30. ""This vehicle stickers for about $80,000,"" he says. With the discount, the price is very competitive with gas engine cargo vans. Currently, anyone interested in purchasing a BrightDrop would need to place an order through the dealership, Lawson says. ""Delivery could take between 10 and 12 weeks, or if one of the fulfillment centers has one ready for us, we could get one in a matter of days,"" he says. ""It just depends on the availability."" Maureen McCowin, sales manager at Greenwood, says that she recently experienced firsthand how the BrightDrop performs while attending the Chevy Experience event hosted by GM in Indianapolis. ""I got to take one on a racetrack,"" McCowin says. ""I got it up to 75 miles per hour and you can't even tell you're going that fast. I couldn't believe I was driving a van."" Plus, she added its turning performance is superb. McCowin also had a chance to test drive a new E-Ray Corvette, as well as a new SS Blazer EV. ""What this tells me is that the EV future is here and is not going away,"" McCowin says, evidenced by new products such as the BrightDrop. ""They're versatile. And people will be able to use them for a lot of different things."" Still, overall demand in the EV market is showing signs of straining. In early September, Reuters reported that GM plans to halt production of two Cadillac EV models manufactured at its Spring Hill, Tenn., plant during the month of December. The automaker also said it would curtail production of the vehicles into next year. Automakers were anticipating a slowdown in EV demand as federal tax credits on the vehicles were set to expire Sept. 30. In July, the Trump administration's tax and spending bill cleared Congress without including a $7,500 tax credit on most electric vehicle purchases that has been in effect for years. GM nevertheless reported that its EV sales in August were the best ever, as buyers scrambled to purchase new EVs before the tax credits expired. In August, GM reported it sold 21,000 battery EVs across its brand portfolio. The automaker said it also expects strong EV orders in September and then reduced demand after the tax incentives sunset. GM is the second-largest seller of EVs in North America, and the company said in September that its customers will have access to more than 65,000 public fast-charging bays across the U.S. by the end of the year. By the end of 2026, that number is expected to grow to 80,000, and then to 100,000 by the end of 2027. ""We're really proud of the fact that General Motors is doing really well in the EV segment,"" Greenwood's Lawson says. In August, the dealership reported it sold five EVs - less than in some previous months, but more overall compared to last year. ""There were years where we didn't sell five in a year,"" he says. New products and model variations in the EV space has helped customers place their faith in electric vehicles, Lawson notes. Improved technology will lead to greater battery range, while style is also an important factor in winning new buyers. ""They're sharp. They're good-looking cars,"" he says. Moreover, GM is consistently pushing new boundaries with research and development, Lawson says, evidenced by a new world range record set by a Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck pickup. Engineers were able to outfit the Silverado Work with a high-capacity battery that was able to run 1,059 miles on a single charge during a test drive over seven days along public roads in Michigan. As technology advances, it helps to drive the price of EVs down. ""We're happy to hang our hat on that,"" Lawson says, ""since range anxiety is the biggest thing standing between someone buying an EV."" The Silverado EV Trail Boss, for example, boasts a battery range of 478 miles on a single charge, using a maximum capacity battery, Lawson says. ""This vehicle has it all,"" he says as he walks around a new Magnus Gray Silverado EV in the dealership's service department. The vehicle includes all of the available luxury amenities, including 35-inch tires, four-wheel steer, and a terrain mode to better navigate the vehicle through different road conditions. Towing capacity for the truck is gauged at 12,500 pounds, Lawson says. ""The tough question I get is 'how does it affect our range?'"" he says, noting that the more weight pulled results in a decrease in battery range. ""I can't give you a straight answer."" That's because the Silverado Trail Boss has the capability to ""learn"" and adjust its battery range accordingly as the vehicle tows its load, Lawson says. ""As soon as I hit tow-mode, it cuts the range in half to be conservative,"" he explains. ""Once you start driving, and the truck learns how much you're towing, it can give you more range. The truck will tell you."" The Silverado also contains bidirectional battery capability, which enables the vehicle to act as a type of power generator that is able to support a household should it lose electricity service. The vehicle is also equipped with other high-end interior features. ""That's what's becoming unique about the Trail Boss,"" Lawson says. ""It's not only about the outside and the things it can do, like off-roading, but it's about the inside and comfort as well.""",Business Journal Daily | The Youngstown Publishing Company,2025-10-01T09:03:00Z,https://businessjournaldaily.com/brightdrop-is-bright-spot-for-commercial-evs/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.506917,0.1215686274509804
ADB ready to quench Azerbaijan's thirst for modernized irrigation - official,"BAKU, Azerbaijan, October 1. The Asian Development Bank is ready to support Azerbaijan in water resource management and irrigation modernization, the director of the ADB Representative Office in Azerbaijan, Sunniya Durrani-Jamal, said at the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), Trend reports She noted that Azerbaijan can count on ADB support in implementing its national water resources strategy, modernizing irrigation infrastructure, and introducing artificial intelligence technologies for effective data management. According to Durrani-Jamal, the starting point for securing water resources, especially for a country located in the lower reaches of a river, is to conduct a risk assessment based on satellite monitoring data. This approach makes it possible to identify water availability in different geographical areas and determine ""hot spots"" -- areas with an increased risk of flooding, drought, or water shortages. ""Sometimes the causes of water problems are related not only to climate, but also to politics,"" noted the ADB representative. ""For example, one South Asian country had a subsidy policy that led to excessive groundwater extraction. This requires detailed diagnosis and adjustment of approaches."" Following a risk assessment, the ADB advises countries on integrated water resources management, considers solutions based on nature-based approaches, and explores possible financial and non-financial support instruments. She noted that for Azerbaijan, the bank plans to focus on assisting in the implementation of the national water strategy, modernizing irrigation infrastructure, developing a roadmap for the introduction of artificial intelligence for the effective use of data, and working with farmers, who are the end users of irrigation systems and seeds.",Trend,2025-10-01T09:04:25Z,https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/4098075.html,2025-10-01 17:27:04.507112,0.07450980392156858

Olympian Katie Ledecky swam by a Johnson County school to get kids excited about STEAM careers,"Olympic gold medalist Katie Ledecky ditched her swimming cap for a lab coat to teach USD 232 students about careers in science, technology, engineering, art and math, or STEAM. Olympian Katie Ledecky has inspired a generation of swimmers after winning nine Olympic gold medals during her athletic career. Now, she's encouraging students in Johnson County and across the country to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, arts and math. The most decorated American woman in Olympic history visited the Cedar Trails Exploration Center in Lenexa on Tuesday as part of her collaboration with Panasonic to promote STEAM education. Ledecky said education has always been important to her -- she earned her psychology degree at Stanford University while competing. She said she loved STEAM subjects when she first started school, and developed a love of math while swimming. ""I'm a distance swimmer, so I was always calculating pace times and running all the numbers in my head,"" Ledecky said. ""I also had some really great science teachers growing up that really inspired me."" Ledecky toured the center's design, automation, manufacturing, engineering and robotics programs before joining high school students in the biomedical program in the laboratory. She also met with the De Soto school district's Women in STEM team and with Mill Creek Middle School Pathway students. She said everyone has school subjects that they like more than others, but STEAM skills will benefit students no matter what career they pursue. ""If you find something that you really, really love, try to be the very best you can be at it, whether that's in the science lab or in the pool or on the field or in some other subject or activity,"" Ledecky said. Sam Ruff, the school district's director of postsecondary success, said they've been expanding opportunities for students to get hands-on experiences and figure out what they're interested in doing in the future. He said it's exciting for students to find out someone well-known has the same passion as them. ""Listening to and being able to interact with an Olympian, someone who has been an exemplar of excellence for us, is going to then interact with our students, and there's just an opportunity for it to spark something for our students,"" Ruff said. Panasonic opened a $4 billion battery plant in De Soto in July and aims to hire 4,000 workers when the facility reaches full production. Officials there said they look forward to working more with USD 232 to increase STEAM education in the future. ""Having educated kids in this school district and other school districts that we're working with around the county and around the state helps all of us,"" said Julie Sailors, Panasonic's senior manager of government and community affairs.","KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Historic pub with roaring fires in must-visit town is perfect for autumn,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info Boasting low-hanging beams, crackling fires and centuries of heritage, this ancient coaching inn provides an ideal foundation for discovering one of North Wales' most evocative towns. Tracing its origins to 1522 and concealed within Caernarfon's medieval fortifications, the Black Boy Inn's structure is rich with historical significance. The robust stone construction, wooden panelling and spiralling steps echo over five centuries of existence in Caernarfon, formerly a thriving harbour and commercial centre. Currently, the establishment functions as both accommodation and public house, where patrons arrive equally for the beverages and cuisine as they do for the opportunity to lodge somewhere combining contemporary amenities with traditional appeal. According to Tripadvisor, the Black Boy Inn is characterised as ""full of character"" and ""the best place to stay"" in Caernarfon. Visitors repeatedly highlight the cordial reception and exceptional personnel as its primary asset. One guest, who arrived following a disappointing evening elsewhere, remembered: ""As soon as we walked through the door we breathed a huge sigh of relief. We had a wonderful welcome and immediately felt at home."", reports the Express. Cuisine and beverages represent another standout feature. The establishment delivers generous servings of regionally-influenced fare, whilst its dual bars maintain an remarkable selection of Welsh brews. Additionally, the ambience has earned acclaim as ""friendly"" and ""welcoming."" The Black Boy Inn's location is another factor in its enduring popularity. Tucked within the ancient town walls of Caernarfon, the inn is a mere stone's throw from the formidable 13th-century Caernarfon Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site erected by Edward I. Visitors can wander through its towering turrets, fortifications and museums before heading to the harbour or exploring the shops and eateries nestled within the historic lanes. Caernarfon itself is one of Wales' best-kept secrets. Home to just under 10,000 residents, it sits on the Menai Strait opposite Anglesey, with Eryri (Snowdonia) looming to the east. The town boasts a high percentage of Welsh speakers - around 87% - and a rich Royal history, having been the site of the 1969 investiture of the Prince of Wales. As a starting point for exploration, it's unbeatable. The Welsh Highland Railway departs from Caernarfon, offering steam train trips deep into the mountains. The Menai Strait offers boat cruise opportunities, while walkers and cyclists can traverse the Lon Eifion trail for panoramic views across the landscape. Dinas Dinlle beach, with its golden sands, is just a short car journey away. For those who prefer to stay local, Caernarfon has plenty to offer. Afternoon tea at The Old Courthouse, boutique shopping at Cei Llechi, and seafood dinners by the harbour at the Anglesey Arms all contribute to unforgettable days out. At the Black Boy Inn, evenings are ideally spent fireside with a pint, basking in the unique ambiance that only historic pubs can provide. One guest summarised their three-day visit by saying: ""It is a beautiful historic building which has been most sympathetically updated... The pub is also a very popular eating place. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and highly recommend.""",Daily Post,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.dailypost.co.uk/whats-on/historic-north-wales-pub-roaring-32552577,2025-10-01 17:27:04.508406,0.4745098039215687
List of Stores Closing in October,"Kroger and Starbucks are two of the largest companies to announce closures, and consumers across the country are likely to be affected. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail industry has faced widespread disruption, with many consumers choosing online shopping over brick-and-mortar stores. Almost 25 percent of America's largest shopping malls are anticipated to close by 2027, according to research from real estate services firm Green Street Advisors. In the Seattle area, Kroger is closing its Lake City and Redmond locations this month. That includes the location at 13000 Lake City Way NE and 17667 NE 76th St. The company stated that 343 workers will be affected. ""The retail industry is consolidating fast, and Kroger is no exception. Their proposed merger with Albertsons got blocked back in December 2024 on antitrust grounds,"" Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek. ""Now they're citing criminal loss, underperforming stores, and a tougher regulatory environment as reasons for shutting locations."" The company also announced plans to close its Kent and Everett locations as part of a larger decision to shut down 60 stores over the next 18 months. ""In this era of mass consolidation, many of the workers we represent have come to expect this kind of callous, out-of-touch corporate management style from Kroger,"" said Fay Guenther, president of UFCW 3000, a labor union representing the workers, in a press statement. ""Staggering store closure announcements that impact hundreds of workers and thousands of our neighbors over the course of two days is really something else."" Kroger attributed the closures in part to theft in these stores. ""Due to a steady rise in theft and a challenging regulatory environment that adds significant costs, we can no longer make these stores financially viable,"" Kroger told Seattle news station KING 5. Shoppers Food, a popular low-price supermarket in the D.C. area, will close four locations by October 11: ""We're constantly working to optimize our footprint, which includes investing in stores as well as closing stores where necessary so we can operate as effectively and efficiently as possible,"" the store said in a statement to TheStreet. Starbucks also announced on Thursday that it would be closing hundreds of stores in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Around 900 nonretail employees will also be laid off, the company said, and the store closures are set to begin immediately. Baristas will be offered severance packages and, when possible, transfers to other stores. ""Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations,"" Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said in a letter to employees. ""This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult."" 9i Capital Group CEO Kevin Thompson told Newsweek: ""Consumer spending is slowing across the board. Inflation is eating into not just the pockets of consumers but also the margins of corporations. Grocery stores already operate on razor-thin margins, and higher costs are squeezing them to the point they can't absorb it anymore. What we're seeing isn't just M&A-style consolidation -- it's a reduction in footprint across the U.S."" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: ""We've seen many major restaurant and grocery chains, from Kroger to Starbucks, announce closures in recent weeks, and there's a good reason for this. The last fifteen years for many companies have been a time of expansion in major markets, as the effects of the Great Recession wore off, consumers started to spend again, and workforce gains continued in most U.S. cities. However, since the pandemic and the subsequent rise of inflation, consumers' habits have changed, and many are feeling cash-strapped."" More retailers will likely shutter locations if they aren't able to address the shifting consumer habits, experts say. ""We saw some companies try to reorganize over the last two years in an attempt to continue operations, but for some areas, retailers are pulling the plug altogether if they feel problems with profitability are long term,"" Beene said.",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/list-stores-closing-october-10790817,2025-10-01 17:27:04.508819,-0.1843137254901961
List of Companies Being Boycotted in October,"The People's Union USA, a consumer-activist movement, is calling for a boycott of six major brands for the month of October. The October boycott marks a continuation of a strategy that The People's Union USA has been employing since February. The group has said that its campaign is focused on promoting corporate accountability, restoring diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and reshaping corporate influence over U.S. economic policies. The People's Union USA is calling for a boycott of the following companies in October: Newsweek reached out to these companies outside of regular working hours via email for comment. Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, and Target are familiar targets for the People's Union USA. In response to a request for comment, a Target spokesperson directed Newsweek to an op-ed published by Essence, written by the company's CEO, Brian Cornell, which outlined Target's ""commitment to inclusion."" It read in part, ""This year, we will complete our commitment to invest $2 billion in Black-owned businesses, more than doubling the number of Black-owned brands on our shelves. Through our Accelerator program, we've supported more than 500 entrepreneurs, helping them scale and succeed in retail."" The retail giant has been criticized for discontinuing its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program, along with other equity initiatives earlier in the year, shortly after President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Disney and Ben & Jerry's, though, are less likely targets for the union. The companies' inclusion in this list comes after both brands have been at the center of high-profile fallouts in the headlines over the past few weeks. Disney has faced widespread calls for a boycott from consumers and the entertainment giant's own stars after the company decided to indefinitely suspend the ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this month, after FCC Chair Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel's remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. Kimmel was ultimately reinstated the following week, as his suspension put him at the center of a political storm over freedom of expression, media independence, and pressure from the Trump administration. His return to late-night television propelled the show to its highest ratings in a decade. Meanwhile, the co-founder of ice cream icon Ben & Jerry's, Jerry Greenfield, announced that he was quitting the company he co-founded with Ben Cohen, and accused Unilever, its parent conglomerate, of breaking promises that guaranteed the brand's independence. The basis of Greenfield's decision was a dispute with Unilever over Ben & Jerry's ability to pursue activist and social justice causes, which are important to the company's founders. People's Union USA founder John Schwartz previously told Newsweek: ""Our mission is simple: we want these corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes so the American people can finally be relieved of the burden of federal income tax."" Walmart previously told Newsweek: ""As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year...We remain dedicated to earning the business of all Americans and giving our time and resources to causes that uplift and unite communities who rely on us every day."" Target CEO Brian Cornell, in an op-ed published by Essence: ""Going forward, we remain focused on driving growth and opportunity, supporting small businesses, increasing access to education and building the best team to serve the more than 2,000 communities where Target operates. This includes continuing to donate 5 percent of our profits to a range of organizations and activating our long-standing tradition of local volunteerism. This is the work we'll continue to do. And we'll do it, together."" The boycott will run for the full month and is part of the ""Economic Blackout Tour,"" which has been running since early 2025. Several additional actions are planned for the fall and winter months.",Newsweek,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.newsweek.com/peoples-union-october-boycott-disney-amazon-walmart-10787216,2025-10-01 17:27:04.509215,0.1294117647058823
DTI imposes 60-day price freeze in Cebu after deadly 6.9 quake,"Food packs are being arranged by volunteers in Cebu that would be distributed to earthquake victims in the said province.File The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Wednesday imposed a 60-day price freeze on basic necessities across Cebu after Governor Pamela Baricuatro placed the province under a state of calamity following the deadly 6.9 magnitude earthquake Tuesday night. According to Trade Secretary Cristina Roque, the enforcement is aligned with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s directive to fully mobilize all government efforts for the relief and rescue of affected residents. She said that as of Wednesday, DTI monitoring teams in field offices had been deployed to actively inspect markets, verify prices, and guarantee an adequate and continuous supply of basic goods in affected communities. Roque emphasized that ensuring the affordability and steady supply of essential goods remains a top priority in DTI's response. ""We recognize the heavy toll this disaster has brought to families. Beyond enforcing the price freeze, our priority is to ensure that prices and supplies are affordable and stable. DTI will be vigilant in making sure that consumers are protected from undue price increases,"" said Secretary Roque. Roque also urged consumers to report price increases and possible price manipulation through email at ReportToSec@dti.gov.ph or by calling the 1-DTI (1-384) hotline.",Daily Tribune,2025-10-01T09:00:14Z,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/10/01/dti-imposes-60-day-price-freeze-in-cebu-after-deadly-69-quake,2025-10-01 17:27:04.509366,0.2078431372549019
The last mogul: Sun sets on Kerry Stokes' media ambitions,"Kerry Stokes wasn't born with a silver spoon and, unlike his contemporaries Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer, didn't get a leg up from his father. In fact, he never met him. The billionaire, who installed television antennas before striking it rich in property development, has presided over a unique amalgamation of businesses that speak to his path to riches. From selling heavy equipment to buying TV stations, and running the show at Seven Network for three decades, Stokes is a unique media mogul and certainly the last of his kind in Australia. Interestingly, the bulk of his wealth comes from everything other than his television stations and newspapers.

RBI proposes enabling framework for banks to finance acquisitions by Indian corporates,"The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on October 1, for the second time in a row. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on October 1 that it has proposed to provide an enabling framework for banks to finance acquisitions by Indian corporates. Governor Sanjay Malhotra said this while announcing the monetary policy. The central bank also proposed to enhance the limit for lending by banks against shares, units of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) while removing the regulatory ceiling altogether on lending against listed debt securities, and put in place a more principle-based framework for lending to capital market intermediaries. The Governor said that the RBI has proposed to enhance limits for lending by banks against shares from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore and for IPO financing from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh per person. Further, it proposed to withdraw the framework introduced in 2016 that disincentivised lending by banks to specified borrowers (with credit limit from banking system of Rs 10,000 crore and above), the Governor added. On August 25, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman CS Setty requested the RBI to allow banks to fund mergers and acquisitions. His comments come as corporate lending by banks remained tepid in the June quarter, with businesses turning to the bond market to meet their funding needs amid falling interest rates. To start with, allowance should be given to some listed companies where the acquisitions are more transparent and is approved by the shareholders, Setty said during a panel discussion at the FIBAC 2025. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on October 1, second time in a row. The MPC also kept the stance unchanged to 'Neutral'. The MPC considered it prudent to wait for impact of policy actions to play our before charting the next policy action. As a result, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 5.25 percent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.75 per cent. The decision was in line with Moneycontrol's poll of economists and bankers who predicted the MPC will hold rates due to the comfort from the higher growth in the first quarter while taking time to assess the data on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms.",MoneyControl,2025-10-01T09:03:12Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-proposes-enabling-framework-for-banks-to-finance-acquisitions-by-indian-corporates-13592811.html,2025-10-01 17:27:04.510289,0.1607843137254903

The 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now | Investing.com UK,"Looking for actionable trade ideas? now to unlock access to InvestingPro's AI-selected stock winners! As gold continues its impressive rally toward historic highs, driven by Fed rate cuts, inflation concerns, geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank diversification away from the US.dollar, stocks of companies mining the yellow metal present compelling investment opportunities. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has surged a whopping 125% year-to-date, outpacing the broader market, yet many gold mining stocks remain undervalued. Source: Investing.com This discrepancy offers significant upside potential for investors seeking leveraged exposure to the gold rally. Below, we highlight the top five gold mining stocks to consider for your portfolio, based on their strong fundamentals, production growth, low costs, and analyst endorsements. As the world's largest gold producer and the only gold miner included in the S&P 500, Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) is the undisputed blue-chip of the sector. The company is known for its strong balance sheet, low-cost production, and commitment to shareholder returns. Analysts, including those at JPMorgan, see Newmont as undervalued, with its stock up 126.5% year-to-date. With gold prices expected to hold above $3,800, Newmont's scale, diversified assets, and strong cash flow position it for significant upside. UBS projects a 20-30% stock price increase over the next 12 months. Source: InvestingPro In addition, Newmont offers a dividend yield of 1.3%. For investors seeking a core, lower-risk holding in the gold space, Newmont is the foundational choice. If Newmont is the king, Barrick Mining (NYSE:B) is the powerful and disciplined challenger. The company has undergone a remarkable transformation, focusing relentlessly on a portfolio of ""Tier One"" assets -- mines capable of producing over 500,000 ounces of gold annually for at least ten years at a low cost. Jefferies calls Barrick a ""catch-up"" play, with a price target of $40-$44, suggesting 25-37% upside. The company's strong balance sheet and diversified portfolio make it a resilient choice in volatile markets. At current gold prices, Barrick's profitability is poised to accelerate into Q4 2025. Source: InvestingPro Barrick offers a dividend yield of 1.8%, supported by its strong cash flow generation. The company's low all-in sustaining costs (AISC) and strong free cash flow position it well to capitalize on higher gold prices. Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM), a Canadian gold mining giant, operates low-cost mines in stable jurisdictions like Canada, Finland, and Mexico, producing 3.4 million ounces in 2024. For investors who prioritize quality management and a low-risk geopolitical footprint, Agnico Eagle is a premier choice that consistently delivers value. With zero debt and $2.3 billion in liquidity, Agnico is well-positioned for organic growth and exploration. Its disciplined cost management and high-grade deposits make it a favorite among analysts, with the stock catching upgrades at UBS and Jefferies recently. Source: InvestingPro Additionally, Agnico Eagle offers a dividend yield of about 1%, making it attractive for income-focused investors. Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC), a mid-tier producer, delivered a standout year with 21% revenue growth and doubled net earnings, producing 2 million ounces at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,300 per ounce. Analysts project 9-10% EPS growth in 2026, driven by its low-cost operations and efficient asset base. Trading at a forward cash flow multiple of 1.8x, Kinross is one of the most attractively priced miners in the sector. Its focus on high-margin mines in the Americas and West Africa, and Russia supports consistent cash flow generation, making it a compelling value play. Source: InvestingPro With a relatively low debt level and solid cash flow generation, Kinross is positioned well to weather volatile market conditions and capitalize on rising gold prices. Unlike traditional mining companies, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) operates as a royalty and streaming company. Instead of digging for gold, it provides upfront capital to miners in exchange for a percentage of the mine's future revenue (a royalty) or the right to purchase a portion of its future production at a deeply discounted, fixed price (a stream). This structure offers superior margins and growth flexibility while maintaining exposure to gold price movements. As bullion prices rise, the company captures upside through existing royalties while avoiding the cost inflation and operational challenges facing traditional miners.

Tiu-Laurel assumes AMAF 2026 chairmanship,"ASEAN leaders showing the traditional handshake during the ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF) 2026. DA Facebook page The Philippines, through Agriculture Secretary Francis Tiu-Laurel, has formally assumed the chairmanship of the ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF) 2026, being the host of the forum held in Pasay City this year. ""We are privileged to host this gathering of leaders and partners committed to strengthening our region's food, agriculture, and forestry sectors. Your presence underscores our shared dedication to cooperation, innovation, and addressing the urgent challenges that shape our bodies and impact our lives,"" said Tiu-Laurel in his acceptance speech on Wednesday at the event, which ran from September 29 to October 3. The Philippines, one of the five founding members of ASEAN, last hosted the AMAF in September 2015 in Makati City. Tiu-Laurel maintained that AMAF is an opportunity to deepen collaboration, foster sustainability, and reaffirm ASEAN's shared mission of building a resilient, prosperous, and inclusive regional bloc. During Malaysia's chairmanship of AMAF in 2025, ASEAN leaders adopted the ASEAN Economic Community Strategic Plan 2026-2030. The roadmap envisions ASEAN becoming the world's fourth-largest economy by driving innovation, digitization, and sustainability to create a single market and production base that is resilient, competitive, and future-ready. The Department of Agriculture presided over several major sessions, including the 47th AMAF Meeting, the 25th AMAF Plus Three Meeting (with China, Japan, and South Korea), and the 2nd ASEAN-Japan Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry Meeting (AJMAF). ""Looking ahead, the Philippines' ASEAN Chairmanship in 2026, we are championing the ASEAN implementation plan for the regenerative and resilient agricultural sector as a priority economic deliverable, which aligns with global climate and biodiversity targets,"" Tiu-Laurel said. In an ambush interview, Tiu-Laurel revealed that the ASEAN bloc may benefit from potential exemptions from recently imposed tariffs by the United States, following the US-ASEAN Business Council Meeting last Tuesday. ""The US delegation mentioned that there might be certain exemptions on the imposed tariffs, and that's part of what we'll look for during this meeting. The tariff that has been imposed on us and the ASEAN members is almost equal. But of course, we're here to hopefully find ways to negotiate with America,"" he explained. The Philippines was earlier slapped with a 19 percent tariff on all US-bound exports. Exempted from the 19 percent tariff are several Philippine agricultural products, including coconut products, varieties of nuts, flour, coffee, cocoa, spices, and fruits such as bananas, pineapples, avocados, guavas, and papayas. Known as the region's highest decision-making body on agriculture and forestry, AMAF convenes annually with the participation of ministers and senior officials from all 10 ASEAN member states -- Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Ministers from China, Japan, and South Korea also attended the AMAF and took part in the Plus Three sessions.",Daily Tribune,2025-10-01T08:58:07Z,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/10/01/tiu-laurel-assumes-amaf-2026-chairmanship,2025-10-01 17:27:04.512063,0.3490196078431373

CBUAE hosts the 19th annual International Operational Risk Working Group meeting,"Abu Dhabi: His Excellency Khaled Mohamed Balama, Governor of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE), inaugurated the 19th Annual Conference of the International Operational Risk Working Group (IORWG), which is hosted by the CBUAE in Abu Dhabi from 30 September to 2 October 2025. The conference reflects the CBUAE's strong commitment to advancing both national and international capabilities in risk management. It underscores the Central Bank's ongoing efforts to enhance operational risk management methodologies and regulatory controls. Central to this objective is the development of innovative tools and practices that enhance financial stability, as well as promote close collaboration and the exchange of expertise to address operational threats efficiently and effectively. This high-level global platform gathers leaders and decision-makers from central banks and financial institutions from around 100 countries, alongside senior officials from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to share ideas and best practices adopted in managing operational risks. Organising and hosting this conference will thus highlight the UAE's leading role in facing global operational challenges, and supporting a response ecosystem based on innovation, forward looking, and international partnership. Guided by the vision and direction of the UAE's wise leadership, H.E. the Governor highlighted in his opening speech the nation's continued progress in solidifying its position as a leading global hub that integrates finance and technology, advances economic growth and fosters international partnerships. H.E. also affirmed the pivotal role of the CBUAE in achieving the ""We the UAE 2031"" vision -- aiming to make the UAE the most secure, innovative, and future-ready nation through strategic forward-looking initiatives that enable the financial sector to face challenges and seize emerging opportunities. The conference centered around three key themes that are shaping the future of operational risk management: integrated risk management supported by advanced governance, risk analysis, and AI capabilities; vendor and third-party risks; and individual risk. In addition to these themes, the conference addressed other topics related to risk mitigation and the development of operational process management. H.E. the Governor indicated that enhancing operational resilience remains a top priority in the CBUAE's regulatory action plan. This includes ongoing efforts to strengthen the financial sector's capabilities to address emerging operational risks -- particularly those arising from rapid technological advancements. In this context, the CBUAE has recently developed an updated regulation and standards for operational risk management, and extended its application to all licensed financial institutions, in line with the principles of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. To further reinforce risk governance, the CBUAE is developing additional standards focused on third-party risk management, cyber resilience, business continuity, and disaster recovery planning, as well as investing in human capital through talent development and building a culture of integrity. Building on its regulatory and technical advancements, the CBUAE continues to drive financial innovation through high-impact initiatives that support digital transformation and sector sustainability. A key milestone in this journey was the launch of the Open Finance Regulation in 2024 -- the first of its kind in the region. This regulation marks a significant step towards enabling data-driven growth and ensuring accountability through third-party service providers. Another transformative initiative is the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which represents a pivotal moment in the UAE's financial evolution. It combines cutting-edge innovation with a robust regulatory framework, further reinforcing the UAE's position as a forward-looking financial hub.",Zawya.com,2025-10-01T08:59:05Z,https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/events-and-conferences/cbuae-hosts-the-19th-annual-international-operational-risk-working-group-meeting-yjsdcti3,2025-10-01 17:27:04.512662,0.4823529411764707
CISA ends funding for long-standing cybersecurity programme,"The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has ended its funding agreement with the Center for Internet Security (CIS), and local and state officials are questioning how they will maintain cybersecurity readiness in the face of growing threats. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has ended its funding agreement with the Center for Internet Security (CIS), a nonprofit that has played a critical role in safeguarding state and local governments against cyber threats for over two decades. In a statement released Monday, CISA said its cooperative agreement with CIS will conclude as scheduled on 30 September 2025. This marks the end of a $27 million annual federal investment that many in the cybersecurity community say has been essential. ""This transition reflects CISA's mission to strengthen accountability, maximize impact, and empower SLTT [state, local, tribal, and territorial] partners to defend today and secure tomorrow,"" CISA said. CISA is signalling a shift toward a ""new model"" of cybersecurity support, which, according to the agency, includes access to grant funding, no-cost tools, and direct cybersecurity expertise for local governments. CIS supports the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), which since 2003, has served as the primary threat intelligence-sharing network for local governments across all 50 states, providing real-time cyber threat information, alerts, and mitigation strategies. The programme has long been praised as one of the most successful public-private partnerships in the cybersecurity space. John Gilligan, president and CEO of CIS, expressed disappointment over the funding cut. ""The MS-ISAC, operated by CIS, has been this nation's most successful public-private partnership,"" Gilligan said. ""While we are disappointed by this decision, as a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, CIS remains committed to the SLTT community."" CIS has been temporarily covering the operational costs from its own reserves, but warned that the current situation is financially unsustainable. To maintain continuity, CIS is now moving toward a new membership-based funding model, including a fee-for-service structure for non-core offerings. During the transition, CIS has warned of potential service disruptions due to shifting priorities and resource constraints. The MS-ISAC funding cut is the latest in a string of reductions from the Department of Homeland Security and CISA that have raised alarms among cybersecurity and election security experts. In February 2025, the DHS cut funding for the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), another CIS-operated programme that played a vital role in advising election officials and voting system vendors on cyber threats. At the time, the CIS website noted it could no longer support the EI-ISAC due to the loss of federal funding. While the site was later updated to say the EI-ISAC Executive Committee is ""exploring options"" for continued operations, many officials fear that critical lines of communication have already been weakened. In March, federal budget cuts slashed $10 million from MS-ISAC's funding, further destabilising its operations even before the complete funding withdrawal announced this week. These changes have left local and state officials questioning how they will maintain cybersecurity readiness in the face of growing threats. ""Where are we going to get this information, and how are states going to communicate if they see a cyber issue happening out in Oregon - how are they going to let Michigan know that that's happening?"" asked Tina Barton, a senior election expert with The Elections Group. Cybersecurity experts also point out that while grant programmes and no-cost tools are beneficial, they often require local governments to navigate complex application processes and build in-house expertise from scratch.",Computing,2025-10-01T09:04:04Z,https://www.computing.co.uk/news/2025/security/cisa-ends-funding-for-cybsersecurity-programme,2025-10-01 17:27:04.513021,0.3568627450980393
European shares flat as healthcare gains counter broader market weakness,"European shares were flat on Wednesday, with gains in heavyweight healthcare stocks offsetting the decline in the broader market, as investors fretted over a potential delay in the closely-watched U.S. jobs data. The pan-European STOXX 600 held steady at 557.9 points by 0711 GMT, after posting its third successive monthly gain in September. Local bourses were mixed. Germany's DAX was down 0.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 climbed 0.2% to an all-time high. Healthcare stocks jumped 2.7% after Pfizer and U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said they had cut a deal in which the drugmaker agreed to lower prescription drug prices. Separately, Novartis gained 2.8% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Swiss drugmaker's oral treatment for patients with a type of chronic inflammatory skin disease. On the data front, British house prices rose slightly faster than expected in September, while a key inflation reading for the eurozone is due later in the day.

Millions of households urged to act today over energy bills | Bristol Live,"Over seven million households on a standard energy tariff are being urged to submit meter readings to avoid paying higher prices from October 1. The energy price cap is set to rise by 2 per cent from Wednesday for a typical household in England, Scotland and Wales, coinciding with the onset of cooler temperatures and increased central heating use. This means that the annual energy bill for the average household paying by direct debit for gas and electricity will increase from the current £1,720 to £1,755. StepChange debt charity has highlighted that while the £35 per year increase ""seems like a small amount"", new figures reveal a 32 per cent surge in average energy arrears among its clients seeking debt advice over the last two years, reports the Daily Record. Simon Trevethick, head of communications at StepChange, said: ""Not only will people find they are having to switch on their heating now as the weather turns colder, but bills are also set to go up this month, which is another blow to household finances. Energy arrears are the most common type of debt across household bills that we see at StepChange, and people have had little respite from steep costs over the past three years."" ""For anyone who is struggling or worried about energy bills, there is support available out there - contact your supplier, check to see if you're eligible for any grants, and of course you can always get in touch with an organisation like StepChange."" Emily Seymour, Energy editor at Which?, has voiced her concerns about the upcoming energy price cap increase. She said: ""As we head into the colder weather, many households will be concerned that the energy price cap is going up by 2 per cent this week."" She continued: ""There are several deals on the market for lower than the price cap, so now is a good time to shop around if you're looking to fix. As a rule of thumb, we'd recommend looking for deals cheaper than the current price cap, not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees. If you're on a variable tariff, make sure to submit a meter reading to ensure you pay the cheaper rates for any energy used before the new price cap takes effect."" Despite a 2 per cent decrease in wholesale prices over the last three months, energy costs are set to rise. This is largely due to an increase in standing charges - the daily rate consumers pay for energy supply to their homes - which are expected to rise by 4 per cent for electricity and 14 per cent for gas, or 7p a day. This increase is primarily driven by the UK Government's expansion of the Warm Home Discount. The scheme will now include an additional 2.7 million low-income households, including 900,000 families with children, after the removal of the ""hard to heat"" eligibility criteria. The Labour Government estimates that approximately 6.1 million households will benefit from the £150 Warm Home Discount this winter. Ofgem has attributed the latest price hike to an increase in electricity balancing costs, which are incurred by network operators to ensure a stable electricity supply when there is both an excess and a shortage of power in the system. This has added approximately £1.23 per month to the average household bill. The energy regulator adjusts the price cap for households every three months, primarily based on the cost of energy on wholesale markets. Introduced by the Government in January 2019, the energy price cap sets a maximum price that energy suppliers can charge consumers in England, Scotland and Wales for each kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy they use.",Bristol Post,2025-10-01T08:59:08Z,https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/millions-households-urged-act-today-10540484,2025-10-01 17:27:04.513558,0.2784313725490195
ExxonMobil expects to cut up to 500 Singapore employees by end-2027 as part of global restructuring,"[SINGAPORE] ExxonMobil announced an overhaul of its Singapore operations on Wednesday (Oct 1) that will result in up to 500 job losses, and the relocation of its corporate office from HarbourFront to its Jurong manufacturing site by the end of 2027. The move, affecting 10 to 15 per cent of the company's 3,500-strong local workforce, is focused on reshaping its ""primarily office-based organisation"", an ExxonMobil spokesperson in Singapore said in an e-mailed statement. This decision comes after a wider global restructuring effort was announced by the energy giant, which includes a worldwide reduction of 2,000 jobs, particularly in Canada and across the European Union. The reductions represent about 3 to 4 per cent of ExxonMobil's global workforce and are part of the company's ongoing efficiency drive. ExxonMobil employed 61,000 people globally at the end of 2024. A company spokesperson positioned the restructuring as a necessary step to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment. ""We are making changes to how we work so we can improve our competitiveness in an ever-evolving landscape and position the business for future success."" While detailed plans are still being finalised, the company has confirmed the scale of the redundancies and pledged assistance for those affected. ""We will provide the necessary support to our people,"" it said. Singapore's Economic Development Board said in a statement following ExxonMobil's announcement that it, along with Workforce Singapore and the NTUC Employment and Employability Institute, will ""continue to work closely with ExxonMobil to support affected employees, including facilitating job placements"". ""ExxonMobil will continue to maintain a significant business footprint here, including in manufacturing, (headquarters) and trading functions."" Despite the job cuts, ExxonMobil retains a manufacturing presence in Singapore, as it continues to operate its two refining sites here: one at Pioneer Road on the mainland and the other on Jurong Island, with a combined crude processing capacity of 592,000 barrels per day. The company plans to exit its HarbourFront office over the next few years, and aims to move all employees to its newly expanded facilities at the Jurong Refinery by the 2027 deadline. ""We've seen the value of bringing people together in the same location,"" said the ExxonMobil spokesperson. ""These changes are designed to improve our competitiveness, increase effectiveness and drive innovation."" The spokesperson added that ExxonMobil has started up ""new base stock production facilities in Singapore, which is a first-of-its-kind technology deployed at scale"". ""We continue to maintain our manufacturing presence in Singapore.""",The Business Times,2025-10-01T07:28:41Z,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/exxonmobil-expects-cut-500-singapore-employees-end-2027-part-global-restructuring,2025-10-01 17:27:04.513878,0.1372549019607843
Sprouting And Growing Mung Beans In Your Garden - Mother Earth News,"Warning: As with most beans they contain some phytic acid (which reduces absorption of calcium, zinc and magnesium) and should be soaked for a few hours in fresh water to leach this out before cooking. The good thing about healthy bean sprouts is that it reduces this phytic acid through the sprouting process. My first source for mung beans was a health food store. I later realized I could buy ""bulk"" from an Asian market. Other Grocery stores sometimes carry them, but I only buy organic mung beans. For me I feel ""safer"" if I can grow most of what I consume-I know what goes into it and how it is handled and processed. So, me being me, I thought ""why not try growing my own?"" I live in Western North Carolina and we do very well with beans and legumes, so why wouldn't this be do-able? It proved to be very ""do-able""! Plant about one-inch deep (if sowing from bean seeds) and 2 to 5 inches apart. If using from sprouted or inside starts, just make sure you plant deep enough to cover the roots. Remember, ground temp should be about 65 degrees Fahrenheit. We use natural compost (from our goats) on our garden so, we don't use any additional fertilizers. I use the same practice of planting/growing mung beans as I do with my dry seed beans. These legumes do not grow high and have a ""bush"" tendency (14 to 18in tall). They take 90-120 days to mature (it all depends on weather). Leave until dry and then harvest. Just shell out like you would a ""dry"" bean. These can be frozen for when needed. You can store in canning jars but make sure the mung beans are completely dry or they will go bad. If you don't like sprouts, there are many uses for mung beans. They can be ground into a flour to make gluten-free tortilla/flatbreads and noodles. The mung bean can be added to veggie burgers, eaten in soups and dals, or used in Asian dishes like stir-fry dishes. Fresh bean sprout recipes are a great way to enjoy their crispness. I like to make recipe cards to help keep track of my favorite preparations! Susan Tipton-Fox continues the farming and preserving practices that have been passed down to her by her family.

""In 2026, the mandatory health insurance system will include individuals under 18 and over 65, as well as individuals with disabilities. The state will cover 100% of the costs. This system will also include 190,000 employed individuals whose monthly income exceeds 200,000 drams.

Thus, during the first stage of the three-year transition to a universal health insurance system (2026-2028), 1,600,000 Armenian residents will be covered. Responding to questions from the Novosti-Armenia agency, Avanesyan noted that the health insurance will cover preventive care, screenings, treatment at a medical center, medications (up to 50,000 drams per day), and ambulance services. ""The list of illnesses and surgeries covered by the health insurance will be approved by the government, but it will include the most common ones, as well as those with the highest mortality rates,"" Avanesyan said, without providing details. As for whether the healthcare infrastructure will be able to withstand a surge in the number of people who haven't seen a doctor for years due to high costs, Avanesyan assured that last-minute visits only increase the cost of services. ""Services will be available only with a doctor's prescription. The infrastructure will also gradually develop over the next three years,"" Avanesyan said. As for employer participation in payments, it is currently voluntary. However, the state will provide income tax benefits to employers who cover employee health insurance payments. ""The range of medical services provided under health insurance will gradually expand. It is planned that by 2028, 85% of Armenia's population will be covered by the health insurance system,"" Avanesyan said, noting that registration is required to be included in the system.

India proposes easing aircraft leasing conditions in potential boost for IndiGo,"NEW DELHI - India's aviation regulator has proposed removing the mandate that airlines can only take planes on lease with crew in emergencies, draft regulations show, in a move that could make it easier for carriers to tide over any aircraft shortages. The proposed rules could help airlines like India's biggest carrier IndiGo which has taken two planes with crew on so-called wet lease from Turkish Airlines, allowing it to offer connectivity with flights to Europe and the United States. The partnership has irked rival Air India, which unsuccessfully lobbied the Indian government to block it, arguing it gives more air traffic to Turkey and hurts India's aviation sector. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) regulations had permitted airlines to enter such leases only in emergency situations, such as unexpected grounding of aircraft. The new draft proposal replaces the word ""only"" with ""normally"", making processing of such requests potentially easier, lawyers said. ""This added flexibility could play a crucial role in easing capacity constraints, especially in light of the limited availability of larger aircraft,"" said Lovejeet Singh, a partner at law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan and specialist in aviation laws. The proposal was posted on DGCA's website earlier this week but has not previously been reported. It is open for public consultations until October 28. The DGCA and IndiGo did not respond to Reuters queries on the planned changes in regulations. IndiGo's Turkish partnership has faced criticism in India in recent months after Turkey came out in support of Pakistan during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. While India's government first said it wouldn't extend that lease, it changed course in August without giving a reason to let IndiGo continue. The current DGCA regulations mandate airlines to only lease aircraft from countries where the average industry safety score is above 80%, but the new draft rules said the watchdog can exempt that requirement on a one-time basis.

US flood insurance program expires | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Let us read it for you. Listen now. Your browser does not support the audio element. Authorization for the largest residential flood insurance program in the U.S. expired Tuesday, leaving homeowners unable to access new coverage and potentially wreaking havoc on home sales in flood-prone areas. Millions of policyholders rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to secure flood coverage that is rarely part of standard homeowners policies and is required for mortgages in areas deemed high-risk. Without passage of a spending bill, the NFIP, like much of the federal government, will freeze. Claims could still be paid, but with two months left in the Atlantic hurricane season and winter weather on its way, homeowners and renters would be unable to buy, renew or add to policies. That would also thwart real estate transactions where mortgages require flood insurance. Lenders are prohibited from issuing government-backed mortgages for properties in Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated ""special flood hazard areas "" unless the building or mobile home is covered by flood insurance. Since private insurance does not offer flood coverage in many parts of the U.S., buyers often depend on the National Flood Insurance Program. ""Each day a shutdown continues, the effects on the housing sector grow,"" said Shannon McGahn, executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at the National Association of Realtors. The program supports nearly half a million home sales annually, according to the Realtors group. Past lapses have shown the potential impact on the market: During a roughly 30-day freeze in June 2010, the National Association of Realtors estimated 1,400 home sales were canceled or delayed each day. The problem would be most acutely felt in Florida where about 14,800 monthly home sale closings depend on securing flood insurance. Texas, with 3,500 monthly closings, would also be affected. Flood insurance access is ""just one of the many ways the extended shutdown could worsen the outlook for the housing market across the country,"" said Francis Torres, associate director for housing and infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, citing housing vouchers and FHA-backed loans for first-time homebuyers as other areas that could be undermined by limited funds and staff. ""There is a direct through-line between a protracted shutdown and worsening conditions for the nation's housing crisis,"" Torres said. Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program through the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. It was meant to improve flood insurance access and affordability but also to set floodplain management standards. ""It's not just an insurance program, and that's probably the most misunderstood aspect,"" said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. The over 22,500 communities participating in the program must adopt minimum standards to access the program. They can also apply for mitigation funding to reduce risk ahead of time. The FEMA-managed program has over 4.7 million policies representing $1.3 trillion in coverage. The National Flood Insurance Program's last long-term reauthorization was in 2012. Since the end of 2017, its continuation has depended on 33 short-term reauthorizations. Lawmakers, industry groups and policyholders have long called for reform to give the program stability and to address issues with floodplain mapping, affordability and solvency. Floods are the ""most common and widespread"" type of disaster in the U.S., according the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, occurring in every state and territory and putting pressure on the insurance system. But only about 4% of homeowners had flood coverage as of November 2024, according to the Government Accountability Office. The GAO has cautioned that FEMA maps ""may not reflect current flood risks,"" and Berginnis said the agency has a long way to go in mapping flood zones: ""We've only mapped about a third of the nation's floodplains, and we wonder why flood losses keep going up,"" he said. The National Flood Insurance Program has also struggled to set premium prices that balance affordability with solvency. The program borrows from the U.S. Treasury when it cannot payout claims and currently owes almost $23 billion. A group of House lawmakers introduced a bill last week to reauthorize the program until Nov. 21. But Congress must look at a longer term solution, said Amanda Devecka-Rinear, executive director of the disaster-survivor advocacy group New Jersey Organizing Project. ""It's not fair to storm survivors and their communities to have this unpredictability and instability,"" she said.",ArkansasOnline,2025-10-01T09:00:00Z,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/oct/01/us-flood-insurance-program-expires/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.515169,-0.0117647058823529

Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey sees sales sink as Budget fears weigh,"Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey has blamed the upcoming November Budget for a further deterioration in buyer demand in recent weeks. Rumours over changes to stamp duty, capital gains tax and council tax in the 26 November fiscal event have seen some buyers and sellers halt their plans. Britain's housebuilding sector has seen sales rates come under pressure in recent months as high inflation and borrowing costs have continued to weigh on affordability, compounding a environment of weak consumer confidence. FTSE 250-listed Taylor Wimpey told investors on Wednesday it achieved a net private sales rate of 0.65 per outlet per week in the nine weeks to 28 September, down from 0.7 over the same period last year. While its sales rate for the year to date is up marginally year-on-year at 0.74 per outlet per week, the group's total order book is around £50million below last year at just over £2.1billion. Taylor Wimpey said there are 'various issues impacting customer sentiment and propensity to buy', including 'the impact of the delayed UK Budget on short term customer confidence'. The group was forced to cut profit guidance in July, citing one-off charges related to remediation works and a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) probe. Britain's housebuilding sector has seen sales rates come under pressure in recent months as high inflation and borrowing costs have continued to weigh on affordability Meanwhile, rivals Barratt Redrow and Vistry have warned economic uncertainties are likely to continue to weigh on demand. Nevertheless, Taylor Wimpey said it remains remain 'well positioned', reiterating full-year guidance for 10,400 to 10,800 new home completions, excluding joint ventures, and an operating profit of £424million. It told shareholders it would help lift sales by bolstering the number of outlets it operates from. Taylor Wimpey wants to grow from its current level of 215 outlets, up from 207 last year. Housebuilder says 'under-resourced' councils are slowing new home push The group said: 'Going forward, average outlets will increase year on year as we unlock value from our strong landbank and redeploy capital for growth. 'We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of the UK housing market, with its pressing need for new homes, and in the medium-term potential of the business to deliver profitable growth and maximise shareholder returns.' Taylor Wimpey shares were up 0.7 per cent to 103.8p in early trading. Analysts at Peel Hunt, which hold a 110p price target on Taylor Wimpey, said: 'The shares are down 16 per cent year-to-date [making them]...the worst-performing large-cap housebuilder. 'The group has released new medium-term targets of delivering c.14,000 UK completions at group operating margins of 16 to 18 per cent. 'The company expects growth to be driven by higher outlet numbers, without the need for new net land investment (it targets a 4.5-5.0-year land bank). Over time, it aims for a return on net operating assets rising to >20 per cent.'

"Forecast: China telco, pay-TV services revenue at $483bn in 2029","China's telecom and pay-TV services revenue is predicted to grow, albeit at a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.5 per cent, from $471 billion (€400.7bn) in 2024 to $483 billion in 2029 with broad-based declines in mobile voice service revenues offsetting expected gains in mobile data segment, according to forecasts from GlobalData, the data and analytics company. GlobalData's China Telecom Operators Country Intelligence Report reveals that mobile voice service revenue will decline significantly at a CAGR of 19 per cent between 2024 and 2029, due to the consumer shift towards OTT communication platforms and the subsequent decline in mobile voice ARPU. Mobile data service revenue, on the other hand, will increase at a CAGR of 5.3 per cent over the same period, due to the continued increase in 5G subscriptions and the subsequent rise in mobile data ARPU. Increasing mobile internet usage enabled by MNOs' premium mobile data plans will also drive mobile data revenue growth over the forecast period. M2M/IoT subscriptions will grow at a CAGR of more than 8.5 per cent over 2024-2029, as the enterprise adoption of M2M/IoT led solutions grows supported by 5G technology advancements and telcos' efforts to drive new M2M/IoT use cases. For instance, China Mobile offers a suite of IoT solutions, including Smart Port, Smart Factory, Smart Airport, Smart Energy, and Smart Healthcare, to enhance operational efficiency through real-time monitoring, automation, and intelligent analytics across various industries. Sarwat Zeeshan, Telecom Analyst at GlobalData, commented: ""5G subscriptions accounted for 70.2% share of the total mobile subscriptions in 2024 and will remain the dominant mobile technology over the forecast period. This growth will be driven by the MIIT's support for 5G infrastructure development in the country, the ongoing 5G network expansions by MNOs, and wider availability of affordable 5G plans. As of Q1 2025, China deployed nearly 4.4 million 5G base stations, reflecting its rapid 5G infrastructure expansion."" In the fixed communication services segment, fixed voice service revenue will decline over the forecast period, due to losses in circuit-switched subscriptions and declining fixed voice ARPU. Fixed broadband service revenue will also decline over the forecast period, albeit marginally, due to the slower growth in new fixed broadband lines and decline in fixed broadband service ARPU. Zeeshan added: ""Fibre will remain the dominant technology to deliver fixed broadband services across China, thanks to the ongoing investments by operators and the government in fibre-optic network expansion. China aims to expand its 1,000 Mbps optical fibre networks to cover all counties and township seats along its borders by the end of 2025."" Pay-TV services revenue in the country will increase over the forecast period, supported by the subscription gains in the IPTV segment and marginal increase in overall pay-TV ARPU over the forecast period. Zeeshan concluded: ""China Mobile led the mobile services market in China in 2024 and will retain its leadership position over the forecast period through its 5G network investments. The operator is also focusing on innovative M2M/IoT services to drive opportunities in the enterprise segment. In fixed communications market, China Mobile will lead the fixed broadband segment through to 2029, supported by its considerable presence in the fibre segment and a strong focus on upgrading gigabit broadband network across the country.""",Advanced-television,2025-10-01T01:51:24Z,https://www.advanced-television.com/2025/10/01/forecast-china-telco-pay-tv-services-revenue-at-483bn-in-2029/,2025-10-01 17:27:04.516163,0.615686274509804
"Mechanic fined RM20,000 for beating sister's dog to death with iron rod","IPOH: A mechanic was fined RM20,000 by the Magistrate's Court here after pleading guilty to beating a dog to death last month. Magistrate Anis Hanini Abdullah handed down the sentence on M Thineshkumar, 23, and ordered him to serve one month in jail if he fails to pay the fine. The man was accused of cruelly beating a male dog with an iron rod, causing injuries, between 10.30 pm and 9 am on September 18 and 19 at a house in Lebuh Klebang Utara 30, Taman Arkid. The charge was framed under Section 29(1)(a) of the Animal Welfare Act 2015, which carries a fine of not less than RM20,000 and not more than RM100,000, or imprisonment of up to three years, or both. Deputy Public Prosecutor Amal Aziemah Kohar urged that the accused be given an appropriate sentence as a lesson. The accused, who was unrepresented, pleaded for a minimum fine on grounds that he had no fixed income, had to support both parents, and claimed the dog had bitten him. Based on the facts of the case, on September 18 the accused struck his sister's pet dog with an iron rod at their residence, but the animal did not suffer any serious injuries at the time. However, the next day, while his sister was at work, Thineshkumar once again beat the dog, this time causing severe head injuries that eventually led to its death. - Bernama",thesun.my,2025-10-01T08:59:18Z,https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/mechanic-fined-rm20000-for-beating-sister-s-dog-to-death-with-iron-rod-ME15007830,2025-10-01 17:27:04.516304,-0.2549019607843137
"Nigeria@65: NNPP Chieftain Ajadi tasks President Tinubu on improving economy, employment opportunities - The Sun Nigeria","A South West Chieftain of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, (NNPP), Ambassador Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyinbo has charged President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to improve the state of the country's economy as well as the provision of employment opportunities for graduates as Nigeria marks 65th years independence. Ajadi said it is worrisome that the country's economy continues to nosedive, despite having enough resources to have a robust economy in a democratic setting. He also charged President Tinubu's led administration to create job opportunities for teeming youths who are majorly graduates. In a statement made available to journalists to mark the 65th Independence Anniversary, Ajadi stated that President Tinubu should use the occasion of the independence to have a retrospect and tell Nigerians what he has done to improve their livelihoods in the last two years. He said the condition of an average Nigerian is pitiable, saying there is the need for President Tinubu's administration to do all it could to improve the economy and save the masses from the present terrible conditions. ""I felicitate with Nigerians on the occasion of the country's 65th Independence Anniversary. But it is pitiable that after 65 years of independence, the living conditions of Nigerians are getting worse. ""Years ago even under the military, Nigeria was regarded as the giant of Africa. In the 70s, Naira was stronger than British Pounds and United States Dollars. The economy was booming. Nigeria was exporting valuable agricultural products that fetched the country huge foreign exchange. There was ready made job opportunities even before youths completed their education but presently the reverse is the case. ""It is ironic that the past is glorious but the present is bad for an average Nigerian. The question we need to ask is, how did we get to this sorry state of the economy. ""President Tinubu should look back and assess what he has done in the last two years to improve the economy and the welfare of Nigerians. ""I urge the government to fashion out ways of improving this economy, creating employment opportunities.

Legacy Gold Mines Ltd.: Legacy Gold Provides Exploration Update on Baner Gold Mine Property in Central Idaho,"Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Legacy Gold Mines Ltd. (TSXV: LEGY) (the ""Company"", ""Legacy"" or ""Legacy Gold"") has been carrying out its drilling and surface sampling exploration programs on the Baner gold mine property in central Idaho, USA (the ""Baner Gold Mine Property"") over the last 12 months pursuant to a 3 year property option it has with Champion Electric Metals Inc. In its news release dated August 21, 2025, Legacy announced commencement of its first drilling program on the previously drilled Main Zone in the center of the Baner Gold Mine Property. Assay results from the first holes drilled are expected in mid-to-late October. The Baner Gold Mine Property sits within the historic Orogrande Gold Mining District that has hosted numerous historic gold mines since Idaho's first gold rush in the late 1800's. Legacy's 2025 drilling is testing for the continuity of high grade and wide low grade zones of gold mineralization in a flatter dip interpretation along the 1 km section of the Orogrande shear structure within the Main Zone. Legacy's 2025 soil sampling program that took place included an area northwest of the Main Zone confirming its prospectivity and accordingly is expected to be drilled in the current drill program. ""The support Legacy Gold has received from its drilling and exploration partners in its first year operating in Idaho has been excellent,"" said Brian Hinchcliffe. ""The results of the surface sampling in the northwest of the Baner Gold Mine Property has caused Legacy to re-direct drilling targets as we received all necessary permitting adjustments very promptly."" The drill program underway has primarily targeted the Main Zone in areas with results produced from previous drilling by Champion Electric that included 20.8 grams per tonne gold (""g/t Au"") over 12.0 metres (""m"") and 8.7 g/t Au over 6.3 m, along with 27 intersections that are greater than 10.0 m, and that average 18.6 m (at 1.16 g/t Au) in the 21 drill holes in the Main and NW zones. Legacy's 2025 drilling has followed up on this previous drilling, but assumes that greater potential width to the mineralized zones can be captured by angling the drill hole direction differently. Hence the goal of the drilling program is to prove the flatter interpreted dip, extend the strike length and expand zones of mineralization within the Main Zone. Highlights of the 2025 Soil Sampling Program 174 samples returned values of >10ppb and 2 samples returned values of >1,000 ppb.Three significant target areas identified with high soils in these areas of 1.25 gram per tonne gold (""g/t"", ""Au""), 1.7 g/t Au, and 1.03 g/t Au.Historical soils combined with the new soils show multiple anomalies with good widths and very good horizontal extents that overlap the locations of interpreted, as well as known fault structures, and geophysical anomalies (magnetic highs and Induced Polarization conductors).Work to date suggests the potential for a prospective and extensively mineralized system that remains open along strike, up-dip, and at depth, along with other un-drilled large anomalies - all of which warrant additional follow-up. 2025 Soil Sampling Program The Baner Gold Mine Property contains an interpreted textbook shear system which is a common feature at producing gold mines world-wide. There are two major fault structures (the Orogrande Fault and the Orogrande West Fault) that act as conduits for fluids carrying gold, as well as at least two other structures (vein systems) that are crossovers between them. Legacy Gold completed a surface soil sampling program aimed at tightening the grid spacing on previous sampling, sampling areas with no previous information, and targeting the gold bearing structures. Results have refined existing targets and uncovered numerous additional targets for future drilling. A total of 841 samples were taken, with 174 samples above 10 ppb Au and 2 samples above 1,000 ppb Au. Three target areas identified are especially significant. In the southwest portion of the property (""Baner SW""), a large north-south soil anomaly is present on both sides of a known fault structure in an area of strong magnetic features. The highest soil in this area is 1.25 g/t Au. It is at least 2.2 km long and 550 m wide which is larger than the soil anomaly at the Main Zone (1.6 km long). In the north-central part of the property, a strong 1.7 km long soil anomaly exists at the top of the hill (suggesting that the soils could not have come from anywhere else or be contaminated by water flow). This anomaly coincides with similar magnetic highs as the Main Zone and coincides with geophysical conductors reaching in that direction. The highest soil in this area is 1.03 g/t Au. In the northwest part of the property, there are two 700 m long anomalies that are along the same fault as Baner SW. The soils completed by previous operators combined with the new soils show multiple anomalies with good widths and very good horizontal extents that overlap the locations of interpreted and known fault structures which are the conduits for gold fluids. The pattern is the same for a textbook shear system where geophysical anomalies corroborate these locations. These suggest the potential for a prospective and extensively mineralized system that remains open long strike, up-dip, and at depth, along with other un-drilled large anomalies, which warrant additional follow-up. Soil sampling is undertaken in some areas of the world where gold from underlying gold mineralization frequently show up in the ""B"" horizon of soils just below the roots of plants, as is the case with the Baner Gold Mine Property. Soil assays above 10 ppb indicate areas of interest that are considered anomalous. For scale, the >1.0 g/t soil assays received equate to 1,000 ppb (i.e. extremely anomalous). High soils don't always result in high grade drill intersections below them, however, they give a good indication of mineralization opportunity and provide additional confidence in targets before drilling. Surface soil samples is one of the cheapest exploration methods available. Review by Qualified Person Mr. Mike Sutton, P.Geo., Director and VP of Exploration of the Company, is the Qualified Person, as defined under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, who reviewed and approved scientific and technical disclosure in this press release.

Rural inflation expected to ease as consumer confidence improves: RBI MPC,"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) latest set of surveys, released with the MPC document, point towards an easing of inflation expectations in rural India, stronger consumer confidence, and continued optimism among businesses, even as credit conditions remain an important factor shaping monetary policy. According to the September 2025 round of the bi-monthly Rural Consumer Confidence Survey (RCCS), households in rural and semi-urban areas reported a slight uptick in their current perception of inflation, which rose by 10 bps to 5.9 percent compared with the previous round. However, one-year-ahead inflation expectations softened by 30 bps to 7.6 percent. The rural households' long-term inflation expectations have been on a sequential decline for the past five rounds of the survey. The RCCS, conducted since July 2024, now covers all states and three Union Territories, with responses from 8,848 households forming the September 2025 round. While inflation remains a key concern, rural households' current situation index showed improvement, remaining optimistic, unlike urban households where sentiment is still pessimistic but showing signs of recovery. The future expectations index strengthened further for both rural and urban households, suggesting that consumers remain optimistic about their economic conditions in the year ahead. The RBI's broader Consumer Confidence Survey also confirmed improving household sentiment in September 2025, with optimism about one-year-ahead economic conditions. A fall in consumer confidence during downturns often typically means reduced spending. The RBI further quantified these links by estimating econometric models such as MIDAS regression and ARDL analysis, using data from 2011-12 to 2024-25. The findings suggest that both the Current Confidence Index and the Future Expectations Index significantly influence actual spending trends.",MoneyControl,2025-10-01T09:03:13Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/banking/rural-inflation-expected-to-ease-as-consumer-confidence-improves-rbi-mpc-article-13592849.html,2025-10-01 17:27:04.518237,0.3960784313725489
Fiscal rules still too weak to prevent another crisis - World Bank,"The current fiscal framework is inadequate to safeguard the economy from another debt crisis, the World Bank has warned - calling for a sweeping overhaul of public financial management, stricter discipline and stronger revenue measures. In its latest policy note, 'Transforming Ghana in a Generation', the Bank argued that fiscal credibility must be restored through ""sustained consolidation"" and cautions against a premature return to international capital markets. ""Investors would see such a move as taking the easy way out,"" the report stated. ""Maintaining the momentum on fiscal consolidation is the most pressing priority. Government should focus on both spending and revenue measures to meet IMF targets and avoid premature access to the Eurobond market,"" the Bank added. This comes following defaults on external debt in December 2022, following years of fiscal slippage, energy sector losses and chronic revenue shortfalls. Inflation peaked at 54.1 percent, the cedi depreciated sharply and more than 800,000 people were pushed into poverty. A bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), combined with a domestic debt restructuring, has since helped restore macroeconomic stability. By the end of 2024, inflation had declined to approximately 24 percent and 11.5 percent by the end of August 2025. Despite this progress, the World Bank flags renewed fiscal risks. In 2024, an election year, unbudgeted expenditures amounting to US$4.8billion pushed the fiscal deficit to 7.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - far exceeding the government's target of 4.2 percent. Such deviations, the report noted, reflect the limited effectiveness of the Fiscal Responsibility Act passed in 2018, which was intended to limit the deficit to five percent of GDP. The Bank recommended a comprehensive revision of Ghana's fiscal rules. Proposed measures include targeting a primary surplus of at least 1.5 percent of GDP annually and reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 45 percent or lower by 2034. It also calls for enhanced parliamentary oversight and the operational independence of the Fiscal Council, which remains largely advisory in its current form. Revenue mobilisation remains a persistent challenge. Ghana's tax-to-GDP ratio lags regional peers, constrained by widespread exemptions, poor compliance, and a narrow tax base dominated by indirect taxes. The World Bank estimated that VAT exemptions alone cost nearly two percent of GDP each year. The report urged the government to enforce the Tax Exemptions Act, broaden the tax base, and explore underutilised streams such as property taxes and levies on digital services. State-owned enterprises continue to impose a significant burden on public finances. The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), for example, has accumulated arrears despite annual transfers exceeding one billion US dollars. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), meanwhile, saw its debt rise to US$1.8billion in 2024 - even amid record global cocoa prices. ""The fiscal risks emanating from energy and cocoa SOEs remain significant,"" a portion of the report read. It stressed that reform ""cannot be delayed further"". Both ECG and COCOBOD are identified as requiring urgent restructuring to stem financial losses, improve operational performance, and curb quasi-fiscal expenditures. The World Bank's analysis reiterated the fragility of Ghana's recovery. While the economy has stabilised following the 2022 default, its underlying fiscal architecture remains vulnerable to shocks and political pressures. Without deeper institutional reforms and stronger enforcement mechanisms, the risk of a return to unsustainable borrowing and future debt distress remains high. ""Ghana has an opportunity to break with the cycle of crisis and consolidation. But it will require discipline, transparency and a renewed commitment to fiscal responsibility,"" the report added.

"""Trying to fill its coffers instead of bringing relief to people"": JP Nadda slams Congress-led Himachal government","New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): BJP National President and Union Minister JP Nadda on Wednesday said that while the GST Bachat Utsav brought relief, the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh is increasing cement prices instead of lowering them, thereby burdening people and trying to fill its coffers amid natural disasters. In a video message, JP Nadda said, ""...On one hand there is joy over GST Bachat Utsav, but on the other hand, Congress Govt in Himachal Pradesh is further burdening the public with tax. We know that Himachal Pradesh is trying to come out of the disaster struck by cloudburst, landslides and floods. With the inspiration by PM Modi, keeping in mind the reconstruction in Himachal Pradesh, relief on cement was provided so that the prices of cement fell by Rs 30...Still, people of Himachal Pradesh could not benefit because Congress Govt in Himachal Pradesh increased the price of cement instead of lowering it...When Himachal Pradesh is suffering through natural calamity and financial issues, instead of bringing relief to the common people, Congress Govt is attempting to fill its coffers."" He called it immoral and insensitive that cement made in Himachal Pradesh is being sold at lower prices in neighbouring states, while people in the state face higher costs. ""This is immoral and insensitive. Unfortunately, when cement manufactured in Himachal Pradesh is sold in neighbouring states, it is available at a lower price but in Himachal Pradesh it is being sold at a higher price. Congress Govt is so insensitive that it has raised tax on cement and water bill...Electricity Bill has also been increased. PM Modi wants to bring relief to the people of Himachal Pradesh but Congress Govt is working to trouble them. This is reveals the inhuman face of Congress Govt. The more it is condemned, the less it is...When the time comes people will teach lesson to this anti-people Govt,"" Nadda said. The reform in the Goods and Services Tax structure, which was approved during the 56th meeting of the GST Council earlier this month, came into effect from September 22. The earlier four-rate system is replaced with a streamlined two-slab regime of 5 per cent and 18 per cent. A separate 40 per cent slab has been retained for luxury and sin goods.

Navi Mumbai International Airport inauguration on Oct 8,"The Navi Mumbai International Airport will be inaugurated on October 8, Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said on Wednesday. The airport, which received the aerodrome licence from aviation safety regulator DGCA on Tuesday, is being developed in multiple phases. The project is being implemented by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, in which Adani Group has a 74 per cent stake and the remaining 26 per cent is with the Maharashtra government's land development authority CIDCO. ""Ahead of the inauguration of Navi Mumbai International Airport on 8 Oct, I met with our differently-abled colleagues, construction workers, women staff, engineers, artisans, fire fighters and the guards who helped bring this vision to life,"" Adani said in a post on X on Wednesday. ""I felt the pulse of a living wonder - a monument shaped by thousands of hands and hearts. When millions of flights take to the skies and billions walk through these halls, the spirit of these people will echo through every takeoff and every step - and to them, I offer my deepest gratitude,"" Adani said in the post. He also shared a video clip of his visit to the airport location and his interaction with people there.

The Netherlands: Hospitality Industry Employee's Duty To Complain,"To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com. There is a lot of complaining going on in the Netherlands -- about the weather, the food, our colleagues and much more. Complaints are also made in the hospitality industry, by guests for example, and by employees. But did you know that employees also have a duty to complain? This is explained below. Dutch law requires employees to submit complaints to their employer within a reasonable time after they discover or should reasonably have discovered a defect in performance of the employer's duties. An employee who fails to do so may no longer rely on that defect. There is, therefore, a duty to complain. Not complained, nothing gained. The duty to complain is now also regularly the subject of labor litigation. An employee of a late-night bar complained to his employer that he was not being paid overtime for his work after closing time. According to the complaining employee, this was in violation of the Collective Labor Agreement for the hotel, restaurant and café industry. The late-night bar argued that the employee had breached his duty to complain because for years the paychecks had listed which overtime hours were paid. The late-night bar therefore believed that the employee was no longer entitled to back pay for the overtime worked after closing time. After all, the employee had received his paychecks each month showing the recorded overtime hours paid. The Amsterdam Appellate Court disregarded the argument that the employee did not dare to complain because he was afraid of losing his job if he did. The employee did not leave it at that and pressed on with his complaint before the Dutch Supreme Court. He argued before the Supreme Court that there was not a ""defect in performance,"" but rather a failure to perform at all. After all, the employee had never been paid for his work after closing time. As a result, the duty to complain did not apply, according to the employee's complaint before the Dutch Supreme Court. Again, however, the employee's complaint fell on deaf ears. ""The failure to pay a wage or overtime pay in full is not, by its nature, a failure to perform at all,"" the highest court found. In a nutshell, the employee had waited too long to complain and did not receive his overtime pay. The Late-Night Bar judgment has been a wake-up call for employees. Employees who fail to complain risk being passed over. So, more and more complaints are being aired under labor law. And because employees need protection, in the vast majority of cases judges rule that employees have not been too late to complain. Earlier this year, however, the Zeeland-West-Brabant District Court ruled that an employee who worked on a shift roster had been too late to complain about being entitled to overtime pay. The employee claimed that he had been required to carry out work before and after clocking in and out. But because the employer could no longer find that out due to the long time the employee took to complain, the duty to complain was breached. Employees have a duty to complain if they want to claim overtime pay, allowances and other wage components. A failure to complain promptly results in a loss of entitlement. There is, therefore, a duty to complain. Not complained, nothing gained. The Late-Night Bar judgment has given the duty to complain a more prominent role in labor law and has given business owners in the hospitality industry an additional argument for stating that they are no longer required to pay overtime pay, allowances and other wage components.",Mondaq Business Briefing,2025-10-01T09:02:55Z,https://www.mondaq.com/employee-benefits-compensation/1685066/the-netherlands-hospitality-industry-employees-duty-to-complain,2025-10-01 17:27:04.521807,-0.3803921568627451
"RBI proposes revamped ECB framework to expand access, ease restrictions and simplify rules","The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on October 1, second time in a row. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on October 1 proposed revised External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) in order to rationalize and simplify the governing regulations. The RBI said based on the review, a revised framework that provides for expansion of eligible borrower and recognized lender base, rationalization of borrowing limits, rationalization of restrictions on average maturity period, removal of restrictions on the cost of borrowing for ECBs, review of end-use restrictions and simplification of reporting requirements, is proposed to be introduced. ""Key provisions relating to eligible borrowers, recognised lenders, limits on borrowing, cost of borrowing, end-use and reporting, etc. in ECB regulations, issued under FEMA, are proposed to be rationalized,"" RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said during monetary policy announcement. The central bank will issue draft framework shortly, governor said. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on October 1, second time in a row. The MPC also kept the stance unchanged to 'Neutral'. The MPC considered it prudent to wait for impact of policy actions to play our before charting the next policy action. As a result, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 5.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.75 per cent. The decision was in line with Moneycontrol's poll of economists and bankers who predicted the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will hold rates due to comfort from the higher growth in the first quarter while taking time to assess the data on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms.",MoneyControl,2025-10-01T09:03:13Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-proposed-revamped-ecb-framework-to-expand-access-ease-restrictions-and-simplify-rules-13592879.html,2025-10-01 17:27:04.521978,0.03529411764705892
Sikkim: 65th raising day of Project Swastik of BRO celebrated at Gangtok,"Gangtok (Sikkim) [India], October 1 (ANI): Project Swastik of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) proudly celebrated its 65th Raising Day at Gangtok on Wednesday, marking over six decades of dedicated service, resilience, and engineering excellence in one of the most challenging operational environments of the nation. Established in 1960, Project Swastik has played a pivotal role in connecting the remote valleys and forward areas of Sikkim to the national mainstream, while ensuring critical connectivity to support the operational requirements of the Armed Forces. Over the past 65 years, the Project has constructed and maintained 1,412 kilometres of roads and more than 80 major bridges across some of the most challenging high-altitude terrain. Despite recurring challenges such as glacial lake outburst floods, cloudbursts, and frequent flooding of the Teesta River, the Project has consistently achieved major milestones. In the last decade alone, Project Swastik has completed over 350 km of roads, 26 bridges, and one tunnel, further strengthening Sikkim's strategic and developmental infrastructure. The celebrations began with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Swastik Memorial to honour the bravehearts who made the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty. The occasion also witnessed Sainik Sammelan, Barakhana, cultural programmes, inauguration of the renovated Regimental Canteen, and a vibrant Swastik Mela. As part of its enduring commitment to welfare, especially for Casual Paid Labourers (CPLs), the backbone of BRO's relentless efforts, Project Swastik launched special initiatives including habitat improvement, provision of enhanced protective clothing, insulated shelters, sanitation facilities, and health camps. Looking ahead, Project Swastik has ambitious infrastructure development plans worth Rs 1,152.66 crores for the coming year. These include the construction of the Western Sikkim Highway, NH-310A and NH-310AG, aimed at enhancing road connectivity to North Sikkim and ensuring expeditious mobilization of Armed Forces. The upcoming projects will also feature state-of-the-art tunnels and bridges, built with a strong focus on sustainability, resilience, and the incorporation of cutting-edge technologies such as geotextiles, advanced surfacing techniques, slope stabilization, and avalanche mitigation measures. As Project Swastik enters its 66th year, it stands tall as a symbol of professional excellence, not only enhancing the operational preparedness of the Armed Forces but also improving the lives of local communities. Its roads and bridges are more than just infrastructure; they are lifelines that connect people, foster development, and safeguard national security.
