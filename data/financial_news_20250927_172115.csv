The Shortest Presidential Campaign,"Culture / Books & the Arts / The Shortest Presidential Campaign Kamala Harris’s 107 Days offers a devastating indictment of Joe Biden.

In painting such a devastating picture of Biden, Harris raises questions about her own political judgment.",Thenation.com,2025-09-26T09:00:00Z,https://www.thenation.com/?post_type=article&p=571665,2025-09-27 17:17:51.114085
