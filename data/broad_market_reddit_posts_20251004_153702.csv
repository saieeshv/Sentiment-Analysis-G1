VTI,1nbqehb,Bogleheads,Going back to VTI/VXUS - not sure why I am even considering it.,"UPDATE: Thank you for the prompt responses and your views on the topics. After I hit post, I went to the gym and decided to stay with VT. Blaring metal music in my headphones cleared my brain. Love the group of characters in this sub. ....continued success.... ===================== Short post, I hope. Does it make sense to go back to VTI/VXUS from VT if I want the allocation to be: 70% VTI / 30% VXUS or 75% VTI / 25% VXUS, or 80% VTI / 20% VXUS for a 10-year horizon? The smarter people (overseeing VT portfolio managers) have VT @ 66% VTI / 34% VXUS. Want to understand better how others see a 5%, 10% or 15% more in the US markets versus ex-US markets in a shorter time horizon (10 years). Yeah, I know it's a guess (no one is a fortune teller), where can I see or hear some comparisons? For me, VT is easy to buy and not be concerned with the allocation, but is money being left on the table hypothetically? May delete later .... thanks for listening and not thinking I'm a weirdo.",83,84,2025-09-08 15:12:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nbqehb/going_back_to_vtivxus_not_sure_why_i_am_even/,2025-10-04 07:12:29.490422,1.0,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.8999999999999999
VTI,1ne8ii6,Bogleheads,Does a 70/30 VTI/VXUS Split Disregard Efficient Market Hypothesis,"I'm a big believer in efficient market hypothesis, and I gather from reading this sub that most folks on here are too. I'm in 70% VTI and 30% VXUS and I resist any pressure to weight my portfolio towards anything specific. If I were to take some of my VTI and put it into a large cap fund, that would essentially be betting that big firms will have stock prices that outperform mid and small firms. But I don't have any insider information that day traders don't have to suggest that large firms are inaccurately priced. To me, that's like betting on the Chiefs because they have Patrick Mahomes; it's already priced into the odds for the game so you'll get the same return long run whether you bet on the Chiefs every game or the Raiders every game. So I felt very comfortable with that logic until I realized that my 70/30 domestic/international split is a fairly large bet that US stocks will outperform international stocks. If I believe in EMH, shouldn't I own 45% US stock and 55% international stock (in line with their global market cap)? If US stocks were really more valuable, wouldn't day traders already have bid their price up to their appropriate level, removing that value? I know I'm missing something, but I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding the ideal domestic allocation, the ideal domestic/international split, or EMH itself.

VTI,1nepx2t,Bogleheads,Should I sell my high dividend stock and buy VTI instead?,"I have some shares of high dividend stock. This was money earned from a side gig, and the purpose of this fund was to give myself a little spending money. I didn't think the side gig income would be there forever (it wasn't) so I wanted something that I could feel comfortable spending without worrying about lifestyle creep. The real purpose was to give myself some spending money, guilt free, for whatever hobby or interest I had at the moment. I'm not sure that I feel that I need that money for that purpose today. More importantly, the high dividend stocks haven't done well as compared to VTI. Year to date, they have earned 2.5% percent versus 12% that VTI has done.

Also, for RRSP and FHSA, I believe VT gives an advantage over (VXC+VCN) due to US withholding tax? Should I keep investing in VT for those two accounts? And what about Taxable account? Should I go with (VXC+VCN) or VT? Seems like same for tax implications? But I won’t have to do Norbert’s Gambit to buy VT and also don’t have to account for USD vulnerability? Lastly, I was wondering if VTI would be a better choice than VT for my 20 years investment horizon given recent strong US performance and their edge in the tech industry. But then again it seems like Global index and US index outperform each other in a cyclical manner. Should I stick with VT or switch to VTI for RRSP and FHSA? And stick with (VXC+VCN) or switch to VUN for TFSA and Taxable?

VTI,1ned2au,Bogleheads,19 and building an aggressive long term portfolio with factors and leverage,"First, I have already invested into VT (Roth) and VTI + VXUS (Taxable). I’m sticking with this for now before changing it until I fully understand the factor tilts + leverage I want to apply. Portfolio Roth IRA Core is VT (global total market) I believe this is better than VTI after reading about single country risk. Factor Tilt - 14% AVUV (US SCV) 8% AVDV (INTL SCV) from what I understand Avantis makes multi factor ETFs - profitability and momentum along with the obvious value and size factors. I believe that there’s too much research on factors that it would be stupid for me not to invest in it. Since I’m already invested in 1 factor, market beta (80%) I think a small tilt (~20) towards 4 out of 5 of the other factors that explain market return is smart. Also keep in mind I have a long horizon (around 40 years) Taxable NTSX/I/E (60/30/10) at global market cap weights. From what I understand this provides similar exposure to VT in terms of equities but I get 60% exposure to bonds through leverage in treasury futures. I did some research on lifecycle investing and was originally going to add some SSO/UPRO to my portfolio to leverage VT but found it was too risky to do so. From what I understand these are the best long term leverage ETFs that you can hold in taxable. Though lifecycle investing suggests to increase equity exposure (no more than 2x leverage), there are no good safe ways to do that IMO. So far those are my thoughts I tried to keep the global diversification but increased my compensated risk for potentially higher returns and also diversified the portfolio with factors and leverage and bonds rather than just VT. Worries/Doubts - NTSX/I/E I worry that NTSI and NTSE will close because of their small AUM and how new they are. - I’m expecting that I will outperform the market by like 1-2% given that my horizon is 30-40 years. And I’m expecting underperformance no less than 1-2%. Is this a good estimation or am I missing something. I’m young inexperienced and still trying to research as much as possible.

VTI,1npk9m5,investing,Looking For Feedback On Brokerage Allocation?,"35M I made a post recently about being a little late to the game with Roth IRA accounts and just opened one not long ago. Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never. I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of 50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account. Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding. It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years. So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it. So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth. 35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks. currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

If so, is starting 401k now good for a target date of 2050 or am I too late??","I am 30 years old today. I just got into Bogle's little book of common sense investing. I love it. I am just now opening a 401k. I was a bad lad in life, never had no opportunities for 401k or other retirement. Finally kinda got my life together as a 30 year old. I'm setting up a 401k with my job, I'm starting a IRA which will automatically be taken from my paycheck as well, and then I'm going to start a two-fund portfolio of VTI and VXUS. At first, I thought I was smart to start my Roth IRA with VTI (70%) and VXUS (30%)... And my 401k with the same thing. Come to find out of course, my Roth IRA and two-fund portfolio are underway, I lay my eyes on the options for my 401k. ADMIRIAL? Target Date?? I then understood I was out of my element. I backed off, began to dig. Now I kind of understand. So, I was planning on utilizing the Rule of 55 at my company which offers it. As I am 30 today, that gives me 25 years to work things out. Am I being too optimistic to assume that I could retire via Rule of 55 and the funds from 401k, Roth IRA and 2-fund portfolio at that age? I planned on contributing 588 per month to my IRA, and same to my portfolio, 14 percent total going to my 401k. At that point, should I be putting my contributions to my 401k into a target retirement date fund for the year 2050? At 2055, I would be 60, which would be when I would look to cash out my IRA. Perhaps pumping all my money into Vanguard's target date 2055 fund would then be more optimal? I'm not sure what to do here.

VTI,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :) I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people. I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion! **Portfolio Construction Rules** To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT. Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK. Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY. Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD. **So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD** Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure. **Reasoning** I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns. Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm. Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe). Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms... This leads to the value premium. However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed. Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns. However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices. We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love. Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time... Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts. The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion. For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation. I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own). It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500 It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade. The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed. So... What do you do about all of that? Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance. As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period. If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth."" Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%. To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns. Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index. Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do. However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above. **The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach. **Performance Analysis** Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like: MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio **Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR** **VT Return: 11.16% CAGR** Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems: We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult. This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT. Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy. For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it... **Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR** For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds. Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78% Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56% Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller. This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe. That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR** That's some significant outperformance! Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...) Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings. There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy... But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising **I know that was a long post... thanks for reading :)** **Thoughts?**",0,9,2025-09-28 03:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nse5u1/using_mgk_schd_and_schy_to_create_a_value_and/,2025-10-04 07:12:13.607332,0.6000000000000001,$VTI,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'revenue', 'profit', 'split']",0.7342857142857142

It lines up with a lot of different timelines in my life regarding immigration status and occupation status and so my plan is to save up as much as I can for a downpayment. I know a lot of people want to put as little downpayment as possible to keep the rest of their money, but I am interested in putting as large a downpayment as I can. I am single and not planning on ever having kids. As such, my portfolio currently of $300k is 76% treasury bonds, spanning from 1 month to 2 years in length, although most of them mature in 2026. I also have about 12% in a money market as an emergency fund, and the rest - 7% in gold and 4% in VTI & VXUS. Apart from that I also have ~120k in a 401k and a pension plan in the country i immigrated from, The question I want to ask is - I am worried about whether or not I should sell and roll the maturity date of the bonds to better lineup with my 2028 timeframe, since I think interest rate coming down might make it harder to get a good rate in 2026 when most of them mature. Because of stock plan windfalls from work i have been trying not to sell anything this year to not fall into a higher tax bracket, and so I am not sure how priced in the upcoming rate cuts are already in the price and if I wait to do it in 2026, would the rates be significantly lower.

I have long appreciated the advice of this sub and wanted to get your input on possibly transitioning my 401K out of a target date fund and into a 3 fund ETF portolio. I am 30 years old and have \~$80K currently invested in a 2060 target date fund through Voya. The fund breakdown is below - returns have been great, but as I've learned more about investing, I've realized the expense ratios on a few of these funds are high, and the fund is a bit more conservative than I'd like it to be given how far I am from retirement. This breakdown has me with 39% international, 22% small/mid/specialty, 21% large cap value/blend, 11% large cap growth, 6% bonds, and 1% stability of principal. The 1% sitting in cash reserves isn't that much right now at only $750, but will continue to grow and is pretty pointless - plus 6% in bonds (which isn't a ton, but I'm OK with even less than that right now at my age). https://preview.redd.it/2bj6evribmnf1.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=581de2132f0bca8169992707dbfba2daf2ac615c My questions are #1- do you agree that I should transition out of the target date fund into a 3 fund portfolio? (ideally would likely do split between VTI & VXUS however these are not available through Voya, only the above listed funds are available - so I could break up between Fidelity International Index Fund, Fidelity 500, Fidelity Mid Cap, & Fidelity Small Cap). Is that worth the hassle or would you leave it in this TDF? I'm not as familiar with these fidelity funds that are available to me. But it seems like I'd be able to avoid some of the higher ER, actively managed funds. And #2 - if yes, how do I go about doing the actual exchange? Do I just sell all my shares and then once they're cashed out, buy into the funds I want? I also see an option on Voya for a ""fund to fund transfer"", would this be better? There are no tax consequences for selling and buying since this is a 401K, correct?

VTI,1n9nv37,Bogleheads,"Does ""Rolling Re-balancing"" have benefits, or is it a waste of time?","Edit: Apparently the formal name for this is ""buy-only value averaging,"" in case you want to skip my explanation. # Alright, let me explain what I mean first... Given a simple portfolio of: * 30% BND * 30% VTI * 30% VXUS If you invest $90 a month you'd expect to put $30 into each ETF. But as investments go up and down, the percentages will slowly veer off course, away from your target of 30%... so later, you will have to rebalance... but if it is a taxable account, rebalancing is a taxable event, so I thought ""what if there was a way to delay the need for rebalancing?"" So I came up with an idea... instead of automating a $30 purchase of each, you only automate the $90 auto-deposit into your settlement fund, then you invest that $90 based on the balanced amount and the normal deposit amount ($30). The formula looks like this: >( X \* (the normal amount you'd put in the asset, which is $30) ) + ( (1 - X) \* (the amount of money you'd put in or take out of the asset to do a full rebalance) ) X is a percentage in decimal form (such as 50% being 0.5) and represents a ""normalization weight,"" which you can use to make all the numbers positive so you don't withdraw anything. I wrote a simple python script that lets a user input a number, and then it find the lowest possible normalization weight while all the numbers are positive, then shows the result in $$ so the user can deposit that amount in each holding. (Github link if people are interested but honestly it's sort of a flimsy python script and not really a user-ready interface... just something I thought I might use) Anyway... theoretically this can delay the need to rebalance while ensuring you're spending more months buying the assets that are currently down/low. # My question to you is: Is this a waste of time? Will this help at all? Are there downsides to this method I'm not considering / reasons it's not a popular method? # EDIT: Quickly the commenters have pointed me to the correct place, apparently this is called Value Averaging and it IS a very common strategy for reducing the need for re-balancing (though obviously not eliminating it). I just made a script that helps me do it manually, but apparently other services such as fidelity will do it for you.

VTI,1nsteob,Bogleheads,Staying the course - A quick analysis of how Vanguard strategies perform in a crash.,"I've been a Boglehead for around a decade now. During these wild economic times I felt the need to re-evaluate my allocations and do a bit of research to be sure my strategy makes sense. **TL;DR** The best approach turned out to be the same as the guides and Vanguard books I've always followed. For your investment dollars, choose a Lifestrategy fund using the typical 4 broad market funds (VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX, VTABX) that matches your risk tolerance and is based on how close you are to retirement, or go with a Target Retirement date if you know when you want to be more bond cautious and not need as much growth. **ANALYSIS**: The AI stock concentration appearing to be an economic bubble, rising wealth concentration is at levels nearing the roaring 20s, labor market is deteriating, inflation increases, dollar decline, and other factors have me very wary of a big correction in the next 2-5 years. I ran some calculations how this would go with a few scenarios to see if it matches the wisdom of the subreddit: * 3 fund approach **US total market + Total international + US total bond market** * 4 fund approach (Lifestrategy/Target Retirement which **adds International Bonds**) * 5 fund approach (Added 10% into VTIPS) * Compared Lifestrategy income, moderate and growth strategies to compare risks and returns. Thankfully, the results corroborated the general Boglehead guides. In general, the 3, 4 or 5 fund approaches had very little effect on the affect of the crash or returns at all. The difference was 1-2% for each crash with only .4% variation in 5 year annualized returns. As expected, the main difference is the stock/bond mix in regards to some sort of ""AI stock crash"" hitting mega cap and other markets. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -4%with faster breakeven in 2 years. * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -15% with a recovery in 3-4 years * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of 21% with recovery in 4-5 years. However that just shows drawdown and breakeven without the focus on long term gains. So I compared the three fund mixes using the 2008 crash and focused on the 15 year return. This showed what matters. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -12%with 15 year return of 3.8% * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -25% with a 15 year return of 7.7% * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of -40% with a 15 year return of 9.5%. As for risk, because Vanguard uses broad market funds it's fairly insulated against a Mega-cap crash instead of just making risky AI bets. VTI for example holds \~4k us stocks with mega, mid and small cap companies, across all major sectors. So, despite me believing strongly we're going to correct soon, it's clear no one is smart enough to know when that will occur and by trying to time that I miss out on all the gains. Basically, it appears best to pick the fund based on your target retirement dates or pick the Life Strategy and adjust as you approach retirement while riding out the volatility. Don't let the initial drawdown prevent you from getting those sweet growth gains. We can't plan for every scenario, and we can't predict the market, which is why we're all here anyway to be more passive while still making gains.That way, if you are close to retirement you get hit with a lower drawdown while not caring about the eventual bigger returns as you focus on stability, and if you have 15 years to retirement you get to ride out the heavier drawdown with a much larger 15 year return. Hope that helps some of you rest easier with a simple 4 fund Lifestrategy/Target Retirement Vanguard approach. **SOURCES:**[https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html) [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9) [https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:\~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble).

VTI,1nwc7w5,Bogleheads,When is it time to change your mindset from building your wealth to sustaining your wealth.  when is it time to buy that very first share of BND?,"TL;DR - When do you stop playing offense and start playing defense? Hey Bogleheads, longtime investor here, and been listening to the bogleheads podcast for years. Need some help from the Bogleheads community. So some background, my entire portfolio is pretty much all VT. My 401k is both VTI and VXUS equivalents, and my brokerage, IRA, HSA is all in on VT. I do this because I have been investing my entire adult life, I follow jack bogles principles by living below my means, investing heavily, and keeping the funds really low cost. I have read a couple of his books. As a millennial, I have been refraining of owning any bonds because I was always in the mindset of building my wealth. I grew up poor, and was always inherently fine with stomaching big market losses in order to continue to buy VT at a sale. Of course if I ever randomly experienced an enormous windfall, like winning the lottery, getting a huge inheritance, or striking oil, then I would obviously not be needing to build my wealth anymore and can just be fine with sustaining the wealth. At that point I would by all means be opting to a 50% stocks 50% bonds portfolio as Jack Bogle suggests. From there on out be financially free to do as I please. So this raises the question I have to the community at what point do you flip that switch? At what point do you have a large enough portfolio to start getting out of the mindset of building your wealth and start entering the mindset of sustaining your wealth. I don't believe it is necessarily a matter of age, but a matter of portfolio size. If you are 20 and have $10M, you should be sustaining wealth. If you are 60 and have $50k, then you should be building your wealth. If a man had a median income and was investing heavily into VT with each and every paycheck, and he got a raise that matched inflation to keep himself at the median all his working career, at what point in the portfolio size would he optimally go from 100% VT and enter the phase of 99% VT and 1% BND and start tickering off percent by percent until he reached a 50/50 portfolio. Anybody got a formula, graph, or philisophical outline they can give me?

VTI,1nryliq,Bogleheads,"New to this, pay off 2nd house or invest more heavily?","I'm new to Boglehead investing. We've made a lot of mistakes. We have a lot to unpack. I have a lot to learn. What follows is a jumbled mess. Will try to vaguely answer questions as best as we can. 1 is fed employee with pension plan. 1 is not. We're 54. We want to retire by 60. One's health isn't great, likely won't see 70-75. We realize we are far more blessed than most and we are very grateful for that. Some stats: Combined income $200K. (gross) 1 has VA compensation, $55K, (in addition to the $200K combined gross from jobs). Rental income: $19K. (gross) Mortgage #1 (primary): $2600. Value $800K, owe $490K. 2.25% Mortgage #2 (rental): $1700. Value $300K, owe $137K. (cash flow negative about $100/mo.). 2.99% No other debt. Retirement accounts/balances/additional FUTURE incomes: 1 previous company pension $550/mo. at age 67. 1 529 plan, now contributing $650/mo., balance at $16K, child is 12. Child will also get veteran assistance/state assistance for college. If there's any left, the balance will be converted to ROTH for the child. It's in an aggressive account (10 years 12.4%, 5 years 13.6%, 3 years 20.8%, 1 year 15.8%). We will keep it aggressive. 1 TSP plan, contributing $31K traditional, balance is $540K, 50/50 C/S. We think we will switch entirely to TSP ROTH starting next year. 2 Vanguard ROTHs: $64K, contribute $16K/year. VTSAX 1 Vanguard Trad: $32K, no longer contribute (switching to ROTH). VTSAX Vanguard Brokerage (joint): $3K, haven't contributed actively/aggressively. VTI We do live below means, but have not been as frugal as possible. Realized we can pay off the rental in 18-24 months by sending extra $4K/mo. Currently, we just blow the extra $4K on senseless stuff/experiences. TSP + ROTH maxed = \~18% of gross. If we added the $48K/year blown, that'd be \~37% of gross invested/saved. We will get \~$2500-3700/mo. SS combined at 62. Pension (before deductions) will be about $4000/mo. at 60. We are not tied to the rental property. Would get about $80K after capital gains & recapture tax if sold today. Could throw at primary mortgage or throw into Vanguard brokerage. Have paid $4K extra the last 2 months towards rental. Positive we can pay it off in 24 months, maybe 18 months, depending on curveballs thrown at us from life. Have insurance policy on each other should catastrophe happen (\~$1M each). If we did that, we could continue to throw the extra $ towards primary mortgage and be real close to fully owning it by the time we retire at 60. Yes, it seems silly getting rid of 2.25% and 2.99% rate mortgages, but this year has taught us: 1 of us losing income completely would be difficult to navigate w/o major changes. If the primary or even rental homes were already paid off, it would be a lot easier to navigate if 1 of us lost a job. I am fairly certain that we will have at least 75% of current income at retirement (in 6 years). So, a few grand less, but also maybe a lower tax bracket until RMDs kick in. Would be nice to avoid those. Life goals: Survive off just the 2 pensions (60 from current job, 67 from previous job), SS, and VA income - easily doable as said it would be about 75% or close to it of current income levels. Continue to let ROTH accounts build, potentially converting the $540K to ROTH as well once we hit 60 (up to the max tax bracket per year for a few years) until it's all ROTH. I realize we would probably want/need to drop the (then) TSP ROTH balance into Vanguard. Doing the conversions would take additional $ from budget every year as well to pay the taxes. With the ultimate goal, leave the remaining traditional TSP and full ROTH balance to surviving spouse and then child, with hopes of ROTH transferring to child tax free once 2nd spouse passes. We have seen the accounts drop 25-40% before, but since we're in growth stage and not trying to time anything, we know to just stay the course and wait and it'll all come back with time - and it always has. Since we don't **plan** to utilize the accounts/balances for income, we think we'd be okay even if it drops drastically just before retirement. All of our accounts have grown an average of 11-15% over the last few decades. Yes, due to life's curveballs and bad decisions, we've cashed out a couple times paying both the taxes and penalties. We're smarter now, but seeking more guidance. Few questions. 1. Smart to change TSP & the 1 Vanguard to ROTH now, with just 6 years to go? 2. Continue paying off the rental (2.99%?) so it's cash flow positive? or sell? If sell, where to drop proceeds? Current mortgage balance (2.25%?) Have 10 more years of deductions for rental. Have no problems getting rid of it, hanging onto it, or 1039 for something else to get more deductions/for longer. 3. Or drop the $4K/mo. into Vanguard brokerage? (switching to ROTH for #1 would reduce the $4K in order to pay the additional taxes for ROTH contributions). 4. We know we're doing great, but are there things we should consider, should do, should stop doing, etc.?",0,12,2025-09-27 15:49:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nryliq/new_to_this_pay_off_2nd_house_or_invest_more/,2025-10-04 07:12:27.528909,0.45,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.7

VTI,1ndcow7,Bogleheads,"Buy bonds? If so, in taxable or only tax-advantaged accounts?","Hi all, I inherited a taxable brokerage account from a family member. The account was invested in individual securities so I sold them all (cost basis was stepped up to when they passed away). I'm now preparing to go VTI/VXUS with that money (roughly $700K) but am unsure if I should also add some BND? I've read that for tax purposes, it's better to have bonds in tax-advantaged accounts. The only ones my wife and I currently have (not counting ROTH IRAs) is the deferred compensation retirement program through each of our public sector jobs, which function a lot like traditional IRAs but with only certain investment options and a $23,500 yearly maximum contribution. The info on the specific bonds (WA State Bond Fund) that we can buy with these accounts are linked to in this post. RELEVANT INFORMATION *Married, file jointly--both roughly 15 years away from retirement. *Make about 230K/yr combined income. *Both have ROTH IRA accounts with about $25K total, invested in FZROX and FZILX. *Both have defined pension plans--401(a) lifetime pension plan. These should each pay about $4500-5000/mo. *Have two kids with 529 accounts (each around $90K), about 10 years away from college. *Own $500K house (owe about $90K) on 3% loan. My question is should I add some amount of BND to the taxable brokerage account when I invest the $700K, primarily in VTI/VXUS? Instead, (or in addition to) my wife and I buy into the WA State Bond Fund at a max rate of $23,500/yr each (pre-tax) to slowly build up our bonds in the tax-advantaged account? Alternatively, that money can be invested in a U.S. large-cap stock fund, similar to VTI but with slightly worse fees.

I am not employed, but would consider myself FIRE at this point. I have a $1.7m net worth ($1.3 m in liquid assets and cash). My expenses are about $55k annually with no debt. Earlier this year I moved about $1m from Raymond James to Vanguard (was paying 1.35%) as this was my Mom's broker and most of this money was inherited. Some other rules to apply in my situation is I collect SS Widower Benefits. I receive $26k a year (half for me and half for my kid). When I turn 60, I receive my portion of that ($13k annually) until I turn 70 and will have about $3k a month when I switch to mine. Currently my Vanguard has two accounts ($77k in an inherited IRA and an after tax brokerage of $763k). The inherited IRA has 8 more years to drain out. I am fine with other the part of my money that is invested at Merrill Lynch doing it myself with an after tax account and IRA. My current Vanguard account has like 70 stocks and 10 bonds that Raymond James did. The allocation is 60% stocks/12% Bonds/11% Short Term (MM)/17% Other (my cash in bank and crypto and 529). I am also trying to keep under the limits for MAGI and ACA as I reported $50k of income this year to the fed. So far I have $20k of capital gains and $7k of dividends and $3k unemployment. I have no international exposure (a few percent points overall). I spoke to one the Vanguard advisors and he ran a plan (have not signed up) and he is basically recommending a mix of VTI, BND, VXUS, BNDX. He kept harping tax efficiency is more important for me because of ACA and I do agree. For the inherited IRA he suggested I sell SWPPX and VTI and replace with BNDX. For the main after tax brokerage, he recommending liquidating most of the account (keep some stocks so I don't realize more then $25k gains) and put it in a mix of VTi, VXUS, and BND. Does this recommendation make sense knowing all this or what should I do? I basically do have the Bogle 3 fund portfolio at Merrill that I have been doing myself. But I do believe tax management is critical in my situation. Any suggestions and advice? I am leaning towards doing this myself, and not going with advisor program after reading how Vanguard is losing it.

This would not change monthly outflow significantly If I did live on my own. As for questions: I am able to sock away $5,000/month. This puts me on track to hit 1M by late 2033. I am weighing the costs/benefits of quitting my job and being a full-time flight instructor to gain hours towards ATP(airline) hiring minimums. **Costs**: Time and opportunity to invest 60k/year at a young age where it can grow. **Opportunity**: Seniority gain from being at airline sooner. Potentially some protection from furlough in economic downturns. **Acknowledgements**: Nothing is guaranteed. I could quit my current job and be out of work as a flight instructor for more than a year. I could miss a hiring wave if I stay at my current job. Either way, I like to think of it as time in vs timing the market. I'm in a *very* good spot for my age(23). And no matter what choice I make, both are good options. Any advice from anyone who made similar choices on a career change?

VTI,1nufdqr,Bogleheads,Windfall for kids,So just a quick history. We adopted two boys out of foster care. While the boys were in foster care with us their birth mother died. Luckily the kids don’t remember her and their bio father is unknown. Several months after the adoption we received a letter from SS. They stated that because the boys were adopted after their mom passed they are due survivors benefits. So now my 5 year old and my 16 month old receive monthly deposits of $482. I’m sticking it in straight VTI in their own custodian accounts. They should have a nice little egg when they turn 18.

VTI,1ne01mq,Bogleheads,$300k in my savings account. I have never invested because I'm dumb. Help.,"First of all, I know how dumb I am and how much money I've left on the table. It makes me really sad but it is what it is. Im 35 and work in tech in the US, so fortunately I make ok money (nothing crazy). No debt. No assets. Very frugal. I grew up poor and a close family member was a gambler so I had an emotional / irrational relationship with money until very recently. The consequence of this is that I never invested any of my money because of the anxiety of ""losing"" it all. Anyway I sorted out my thoughts on this and decided to finally make a change, but now I have my entire net worth sitting in my savings account and I have no idea what to do with it. The markets are crazy and the thought of ""picking"" a place to invest is overwhelming me with anxiety. I would really appreciate some advice: 1. What do I do with all the parked money? 2. How should I allocate future ""automatic"" investments moving forward? I'm obviously not interested in day trading or staring at line go up. I just want to set it and forget it. It doesn't need to be perfect by any means. I discovered this sub recently and I really appreciate the attitude you have to investing, which definitely helped me make this decision. Thank you all. EDIT: OMG I thought this post would get like 3 comments. If I had known how much attention this would get I wouldn't have been so negative! Everyone has been so helpful you have no idea how grateful I am! I signed up to Vanguard and will max out the Roth IRA + will probably do a lump sum of like 50% of the money into VTI while I consider what to do with the rest. I'll keep like 50k in my savings. If the market crashes right after I invest (probably lol) I'll try to keep in mind the long term view. I'm not smart enough to time the market. This was the hardest part to accept. Some questions people had: - HYSA? -> Thankfully, I've used the Ally Bank HYSA for like 15 years. - 401k? -> Embarrassing to admit, but I never contributed to my 401k. I'll change that asap. I'm gonna get strong reactions to that last one (rightly so). This is difficult to talk about because I normally consider myself a ""reasonable"" person, but I hope this helps people understand the reality distortion field that relative poverty can put you in. A lot of my family and friends from back home have this ""money under the mattress"" mentality that was really difficult for me to get rid of. Investing is seen as irresponsible or borderline gambling when your day-to-day life feels so precarious. Of course, my life is very different now and I consider myself a very lucky person. I'll try to do things right from now on and hopefully I'll be able to forgive myself for the lost time and move on. This post got a lot of attention so I hope it also helps others in a similar situation.

VTI,1nlg2xj,stocks,International index could outperform US stocks,"VXUS (Vanguard international index) has been outperforming VTI (Vanguard total stock index) since February. I have a simple hypothesis that is being proven correct empirically: **Weakening dollar and overvalued US stocks will cause VSUX to outperform VTI** Bogleheads are all too familiar with the theory 30-40% international diversification in their portfolios. But what about the rest of investors? Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement. Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation. But I suspect that few winners will carry the lot, still resulting in broad market underperformance compared to internationals. It can't be ignored that solid international equities are much cheaper with reasonable PE relative to US hyper PE growth companies. https://i.imgur.com/OgvjdS6.png",39,14,2025-09-19 21:30:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlg2xj/international_index_could_outperform_us_stocks/,2025-10-04 07:12:58.799049,0.4,$VTI,0.9,[],[],0.8999999999999999

So my question is - when does it make sense to go with a managed account? (The advisor said they would be purchasing individual stocks in a managed account). I was planning to go with either: VTI (60-70%) with the rest in VXUS and BND. Or FSKAX/FTIHX/FXNAX - however this is in a taxable brokerage account so the Vanguard ETFs might be better?

Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance. I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

For ongoing contributions of about 300 a month, I’d direct 60% into VUSXX, 25% into bonds, and 15% into equities (split 70% VTI / 30% VXUS).

VTI,1nnphwp,Bogleheads,First Brokerage Account: Cash Deposit vs. MMF,"Hey all, I have been reading through many blogs, watching many videos and talking to numerous friends about starting an investment portfolio. I've decided that I want to use Vanguard to create a portfolio with one index/mutual fund and several ETFs. I am taking every step cautiously and am tripped up at step one, adding money to the Vanguard account. Cash Deposit versus MMF. I understand that Cash Deposit is essentially a HYSA but am having trouble understanding what MMF is. All I want is to put 3 or 4 k in the account to start investing. If I want to invest in VTI or VOO index funds can I use either Cash Deposit or MMF?

I’ve seen a lot of people here recommend VOO, VTI, or VXUS for investing, but with my short timeline I’m not sure if I should just throw it in an index fund and chill, or go for something safer like bonds.

VTI,1n8bewz,investing,Is VTI/VXUS a Good Two-Fund Portfolio?,"I'm looking for generally the best low cost ETFs for my retirement, but with so many options out there I'm not 100% sure on if my choices would be the right call in the long run. For context, I'm 27 years old with a monthly income of around $1400-$1600 USD after deductions. I want to retire earlier than 65. I already put 6% of my paycheck into a 401k plan though Walmart(matched), and put in another $70 every paycheck in company stock. If VTI/VXUS is a good combo, what would be a good split? 70/30 vs 80/20? Thanks so much in advance! 🙂",15,23,2025-09-04 14:17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n8bewz/is_vtivxus_a_good_twofund_portfolio/,2025-10-04 07:12:13.618828,0.3,$VTI,0.8,[],"['rally', 'split']",0.8114285714285714
VTI,1nj0nz0,Bogleheads,VT vs VTI/VXUS in Taxable vs Tax Advantaged,"Hey all, I know this question gets asked a lot around here but I wanted to clarify something. Should the type of account dictate which type (VT or VTI/VXUS) to use or are they so similar that it doesn’t matter? Or should I use the same split across all accounts? I know VT has the advantage of being simpler and reducing the room for behavioral error, while VTI/VXUS gives more control over weights/allocation. So is one better in a regular brokerage vs a tax advantaged retirement account like a Roth?",14,7,2025-09-17 02:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nj0nz0/vt_vs_vtivxus_in_taxable_vs_tax_advantaged/,2025-10-04 07:12:27.542879,0.3,$VTI,0.5,[],['split'],0.8057142857142856

VTI,1nuwzer,Bogleheads,VT vs VTI/VEU question,"Hey bogleheads, I’ve been lurking for a while and have a question as I’m finally setting up my taxable portfolio. I’m trying to understand why I don’t see the combination of VTI/VEU mentioned more as a recommendation. I get that VT is a simple one fund answer so can definitely understand the appeal, but from my understanding VTI/VEU would give you exposure to US and international as well and therefore would be a solid option. I have 50k im planning to invest so id love to here what other things to consider when choosing between the two. For context, im 30 and have a 401k im maxing with Roth contributions and a Roth IRA I contribute to.",0,4,2025-10-01 02:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nuwzer/vt_vs_vtiveu_question/,2025-10-04 07:12:27.520167,0.3,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.6
