AAPL,1nwif2h,wallstreetbets,$GOOGL getting ready to enter PC and operating software space to compete $MSFT $AAPL,Think this isn't getting enough views. Appears that $GOOGL $GOOG will be entering the P/C/Laptop world with a Operating system based on Android that allows for Apps to be downloaded directly onto the PC. Think this was much needed and will help break the monopoly that Microsoft has. I current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel). I stopped paying last year and have since used Google office products which have been free and seen no issues. Would love to see more Google apps available more easily on the home screen. Not a easy task going against Microsoft - but lets see how it plays out. They did this with Chromebook in 2011 and made it the biggest laptops for education in the world. A gamble that paid off.,1302,209,2025-10-02 22:41:07,https://www.theverge.com/news/784381/qualcomm-ceo-seen-googles-android-pc-merger-incredible,2025-10-23 08:19:53.788215,1.0,$AAPL,1.0,"['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']",[],0.9999999999999999
GOOGL,1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better. However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it. When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value. After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years. From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500. Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations. Anyways here are the results: FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price? Probably not. Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs. That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding. Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels. For me this is a clear hold.",275,142,2025-09-27 10:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,2025-10-23 08:22:24.490034,1.0,$GOOGL,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'rally', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'eps']",0.9285714285714285

GOOGL,1o7ucia,ValueInvesting,Stock Picker View: Market Overpriced. New Normal or Sit on HYSA or VOO/VUG and Ride the Wave? Or Let's Pick Some Stocks!!??,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Always been a value stock picker guy. Have had my wins and losses. Bought MSFT at 22 in 2009 when it was dead money 10 years prior (I thought MSFT phone was going to be a thing if I'm being honest). Richard Kinder suckered me in to KMI at 40 with his dividend forecasts and then cut it immediately thereafter (but at least I DCA'ed). My 401k is in FSGPX (basically VUG) but I'm a stock picker at heart with MSFT KMI MO ABBV/ABT CSCO WFC a shit ton of GOOGL (lucky but obvious at 150) at the heart of my stock portfolio. Lost on NOK, SAN (though it's coming back) ARCO and that's about it. Anyway, here's my dilemma. What the hell do we buy right now? I honestly still love GOOGL but some of that is rose colored lenses because it's been good to me. But I do think it will be the highest MC stock in the world before long. And I'm not going to buy more of something that's run so hard so fast. But it's basically the Berkshire of tech. Looked at PFE DIS JD BRK.B. Can't pull the trigger. PFE is the classic value play but of they cut the dividend that's going sub 20 and the pipeline legit scares me unless the GLP-1 drug actually works. DIS has been dead money for years and has no growth. JD is the leader in the clubhouse but China is China. BRK.B I feel like I'm better off just buying VUG and VOO and riding the ridiculous valuations of the market instead of chugging along at 7-8%. Oh and I'm not buying NVO at 1.7T market cap My honest opinion is this is a different market and 25 forward PE is the old 10 forward PE and everyone wants to make 100% gains in 3 weeks and making 100% gains in 5 years is boring. Jesus give me 100% gains every 5 years forever please. So what's the real play? HYSA at ~4%? VOO/VUG and ride out the dip? Wait for the inevitable correction (which may be in 2 years with AI spending and the current administration)? Or let's pick some fucking stocks?????

GOOGL,1o7yfof,wallstreetbets,Account recovery (600 -> 17k) thanks to tariff-driven volatility and LEAPS,"Ive been down about 15k since 2020 madness after chaining some terribly timed trades when vaccines were coming out with short-term calls. Account was dormant for years. Come liberation day and that massive drop in April I bet the 800 or so left in my account on LEAPS assuming there’s no way this admin is going to let the market go to shit hyping up the “golden age”, plus devaluation of the dollar forcing money to continually go to equities. I chose GOOGL and NVDA mainly at first, NVDA was way less far out (expiry in July) because the premium was still expensive for my little account, the GOOGL contracts were Jun 2026 expiry. NVDA rebounded pretty quick and I used the proceeds from that to divest into a bunch of other random stuff (see screenshots) that I saw getting hyped in random threads, basically gambling and got lucky it worked out. GOOGL I held for a while but at one point it was such a massive gain that I sold and replaced with a smaller footprint, that is still the largest gain I’ve had to date from any trade ($555 to $4700). Lots of SPY trades for not a lot of gain mostly because I was hedging volatile times along the way with weekly calls/puts (especially over weekends and FOMC meetings where things felt dicey). I’ve since converted more than half of my portfolio to shares but still have some random LEAPS where I found DD interesting and the risk/reward was appetizing, mainly for LAES as of late. Im holding Jan 2027 LEAPS that are up 800% in like a month, will prob trim that and roll into some other LEAPS.",162,26,2025-10-16 06:00:53,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7yfof,2025-10-23 08:21:41.491766,0.8500000000000001,$GOOGL,1.0,[],"['calls', 'puts']",1.0

Currently trading at 8 PE, PEG 0.28 2. CDLR - construction company that focuses on offshore wind turbines. Company has 2.5 Billion euros of backlog contracts signed. Trading at 6.98 PE, PEG 0.07 (how is that even possible?) 3. KAP.IL - largest uranium extractor, with lowest uranium extraction cost. They are going through company restructuring and trading at PE of 11. Pays huge dividend as well. 4. BN - just because this looks like a very diversified bet in one stock.

MSFT,1npdpk7,ValueInvesting,CRWV and CORZ,"All previous crypto mining stocks transitioning to AI/HPC are going up. Why? Because big tech is throwing money at them. MSFT, META, GOOG CEO’s have all acknowledged that the biggest restriction to AI growth is power not GPUs. Which companies have the most amount of power to power data centers? CRWV and CORZ. The demand is so far beyond what people currently understand. MSFT threw a $19B deal at NBIS for 300MW + 400MW extension. CRWV has 470MW active as of Q2 2025, and target ~1000MW by year end. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner. NVIDIA also announced that they are backstopping any excess cloud from CRWV for up to $6B up to 2030. Even if they need it or not, they agreed to this. CRWV has 2.2GW of contracted power capacity that they can expand into (the bottleneck). CORZ has $5B market cap. They have 900MW of power that is active and dedicated to AI but needs connecting to GPUs etc. another 400MW used for Bitcoin mining, bringing total to 1.3GW. They also have 1GW of expansion also possible. They had 50MW active and powering GPUs by Q2 2025. Year end goal is 250MW. That is 5x the revenue they were generating before. They also still have 650MW more to expand to. Remember NBIS got a $19B deal for 300MW + 400MW possible expansion. I value CORZ at $15B market cap, would not even think about selling before. I expect them to crush next earnings call and market to price them closer to fair value. For the acquisition by CRWV deal, this will not go through unless CRWV stock goes up a lot higher maybe $200. Shareholders are not happy with current deal (Two Seas capital which is largest active shareholder has shown opposition). Stock price also tanked ~30% after deal announcement, but this will also not go through unless shareholders approve (big opposition over current deal). Finally, just want to mention big hedge fund buying. Jane Street and Coatue Management are hedge funds that have outperformed the market significantly over last 3 years (achieving 90%+ and 180%+ over last 3 years) have made CRWV their biggest holding at 4% and 8% respectively. There is also a cracked OpenAI guy (1st in his class in Columbia) that started his own hedge fund called Situational Awareness who has like 65% returns over last two quarters has CORZ as his third biggest holding at 20% of his portfolio.",2,5,2025-09-24 14:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1npdpk7/crwv_and_corz/,2025-10-23 08:24:27.280388,0.6000000000000001,$MSFT,0.6,[],"['earnings', 'market cap', 'revenue', 'acquisition']",0.6228571428571429
GOOGL,1o1kjzn,ValueInvesting,Opinions on investing strategy,"This year has been a crazy ride. I've learned so much but still feel I have no idea what I'm doing. I had been ""investing"" since 2021 but never made (or lost) any real money. Started to take it more seriously and actually use my head a little over a year ago in the summer of 2024 when I realized I was missing out sitting on the sidelines waiting for a crash. I'm in my mid 20s for context and have been working my first real job for a few years. In January I was up 15%. April this year I was 20% in the red. Today up 18% overall. Reluctantly sold a few things that would have been up pretty well now, bought GOOGL at $155 but sold when it got Back to $200, I had INTC last year at $19 and watched it go up but ultimately decided it was a shit business that makes no money and my crystal ball didn't foresee the orange man buying it, I also had some ELV at $275 and sold that too soon, but rebalanced into what I thought was going to be safer going forward. I sold some of those early thinking no way the market has recovered that easily after so much fear. I mean it feels like a different world and that was only 6 months ago. Especially when people talk about Dot Com similarities, runaway inflation, soaring national debt, it's easy to get wrapped up in the fear. Not so sure if I just got lucky off the bull market recovery or what. I could have sold everything at a loss and been worse off and been THAT guy I suppose. Sorry if this has been long but here's my yearly performance. I honestly don't know if this is bad or good. My brokerage chart tells me I'm about in line (currently) with the S&P over the last year. I'd like it to be higher and it would have been had I not panic sold a few. But what can I really expect I guess. I'm not Warren Buffett. ~ 34% of my portfolio is UNH. Caught my eye when it lost almost half its value initially before the institutional money was known to be flowing in but I had realized that insider buys were up in the tens of millions so I had a pretty good feeling to buy then. I like the company despite the hate and would have bought higher and continuing to buy. +38.75% YTD and by far my favorite position. ~ 30% is a mix of S&P and Nasdaq tracked indexes though I am not up as much in those as I mainly started buying in after the April draw downs and haven't been exposed to them as long as I should have over the last 3 years. +14% combined YTD. Obviously not selling that ever. ~ 12% in LULU which I am down a bit on though I'm not sweating... yet. -23% YTD. My only real bad bet. Could have gotten out when it was flying high last year and have been holding since. Not very confident on a 5-10 year basis but believe I can make my money back if not more within the next year and would put it to something other than apparel. ~ 6.5% in NVO. I am a believer in the medicine and think they're beaten down compared to LLY which was in a similar position before they got theyre GLP-1 to market though I think those tables may turn again once Novo gets the Wegovy pill approved and widely available. +8% YTD ~ 4.2% recently allocated to ADBE after the recent draw down and will DCA heavy if it goes lower (I sold Google too soon and this is my next best tech value play at least in my head, will rebuy Google on whatever correction happens next, or I'll just miss the boat on it). -0.2% YTD ~ 2% in PYPL. I had more in this one last year around the price I have it now and watched it go to $90 which didn't last long and I only made a few hundred by the time I exited. Overall I believe in PayPal's turnaround plan but do realize it is years out from being successful. Re-entered a small position and now + 9.9% YTD ~ the rest is small bs like RR and a CURLF I'm up +265% in though I do not have much in as I don't buy penny stocks or OTC seriously. Kind of bullish on the weed if some shock legalization/rescheduling occurs but that's a huge if. ~ and about 8% cash in the brokerage that I'm waiting to use in something like ELV or GOOG once I see them come back down. Or anything else I think might be a great value buy after losing 50-60% on some overblown fear that seems to be the new normal for this bull run.

GOOGL,1nvuluv,ValueInvesting,AMZN is cheaper than you think,"So I'm sure many people are looking at AMZN's P/E ratio of 33.7x and thinking that while it's more reasonable than it used to be, it's still pretty expensive. Especially when you can pickup shares of GOOGL or META at 26x. But I think a useful valuation metric to look at is the price to operating cash flow and I'll explain why. Net income is an accounting metric that includes depreciation and amortization, and it's up to the business to decide the schedule for those, meaning they can decide, for example, that the useful life of a GPU is 6 years when in reality it's probably 2 years. Another problem is that GAAP requires companies to mark to market any investments each quarter, meaning that if a company holds shares of a different company, the change in price effects net income. This is why investors run discounted cash flow models, because ultimately cash is what matters--not accounting results. The value of a business is the present value of the future cash you can extract from the business over its life. The problem with using free cash flow is that capex is part of the equation, and capex is highly variable year to year. Some years you may buy a new office building and a new warehouse and a bunch of warehouse equipment, and other years you might not buy anything. Operating cash flow removes capex from the equation which allows you to simply focus on how much cash the business actually produces from its operations. Not paper gains of a stock they hold, or because they chose to extend the useful life of their assets. Just the operations. So on a price to trailing twelve month P/OCF ratio, here are the results for the Magnificent 7 stocks: * TSLA: 91.3x * NVDA: 59.0x * AAPL: 34.9x * MSFT: 28.3x * GOOGL: 22.1x * AMZN: 19.4x * META: 17.6x Now you might think this is stupid because free cash flows are what matter. Who cares if your operating cash flow is great but you need to spend it all on capex to continue generating the cash flow? While this is true, I think it's useful to compare just the operating businesses as capex is highly variable and is a choice that doesn't need to be made in perpetuity. Now of course, AMZN is by far the most structurally capital intensive (besides TSLA? maybe?) since they actually move real stuff in the real world so that needs to be taken into consideration. Anyway, just thought I'd share. I think understanding the price you're paying relative to the cash generated by operations is useful and should be considered when evaluating a business' valuation.",254,127,2025-10-02 04:49:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nvuluv/amzn_is_cheaper_than_you_think/,2025-10-23 08:22:57.437042,0.55,$GOOGL,0.6,[],['rally'],0.9057142857142856
GOOGL,1nz0un0,ValueInvesting,Quality Buys,"I am 19 with tech internships saved up portfolio of nearly $18,000 of high quality individual picks only with 4 months of experience (started in May 2025) in investing trying to practice stock picking so no ETFs (on purpose) even though it great. I only have EF of $2,000 invest all my income into stock market. Biggest winners (avg entry): GOOGL ($160), MU ($110), ASML ($690) Semi-winners: MRVL ($60), AMD ($130), TSM ($230), HHH ($70 - Small cap success) Semi-Flops (not necessarily loser): Amazon ($210) HM: Broadcom, I ran out of money to buy but I told all my friends that at $290-300 AVGO was undervalued against the popular sentiment, because Fundstrat & GS bought in last 13F filings. It spiked to $360 after earning call week. Recently, I have been trimming all of my holdings and taking profits. Holding roughly $5000 in buying power. I need help looking towards investing somewhat outside of tech, and definitely semi/chips industry as a whole. Right now, one stock that really does fit into this category of quality at a good price. I have to say is SPGI (SP Global). It a company that have been well-known to perform well during periods of financial easing conditions (cutting rates). The company has a wide moat that stood the test of time in quality and management. With banks having PT of $600+ ($660 I think) and a fair valuation of Morningstar at $560. Trading at $470-480 is literally charity. Again, you could say that I only crushed SP500 performance because I got lucky investing heavy into semi-equipment boom cycle I understand.

MSFT,1nxdjz7,stocks,Signs Are Pointing to $QBTS Quietly Building Momentum for a 2025 Breakout,"$QBTS just secured $400M through an equity raise and added a NASA partnership, which strengthens both its funding base and credibility at a time when quantum computing is shifting from theory into real-world application. Insider activity between September 12 and 15 showed seven transactions totaling about $1.52M, with 79% of that value from sales. While that kind of selling can bring short-term pressure, it is often part of normal liquidity behavior for a company scaling at this stage. Against giants like $MSFT and $IBM, $QBTS is differentiating itself by pushing harder on commercialization. With the capital raise complete and adoption trends picking up, 2025 may be the year it proves whether it can hold ground in the broader quantum race. Commercial traction is becoming clearer too, with bookings in Asia Pacific up 83%. Analysts are pointing to the stronger balance sheet and expanding customer adoption as reasons the outlook looks favorable. I actually made an entry on bitget to test the momentum but decided to exit for now and take more time to study the fundamentals before leaning in further. Curious to hear how others on this sub are reading the company’s moves. Does the raise, NASA tie-in, and growth in bookings look like the right setup for long-term strength, or do you think the insider selling signals caution?

GOOGL,1o94jfr,ValueInvesting,Is NVO a bad stock being pumped by bag holders?,"I don't generally do biotech because I've had bad experiences.

GOOGL,1oc3ycm,ValueInvesting,Value Trap - Google,"Google has often been called a value stock, but I see it as a classic value trap, especially now, for the people touting it as one. This subreddit is fixated on the company's historical dominance and massive cash flow, yet continues to fails to fully price in the risks threatening its OG business model. Google's profits: 1. Are fundamentally tied to the cost per click advertising model within search. This generates most of their money, and relies on a user being directed to a page where they are exposed to multiple ads. This is now under direct attack. Just because it is still growing, doesn’t mean that it’s not going to fail. It can take a long time to stop a massive, powerful train. I believe there is momentum that is having ad revenues grow, while also being cut into, and that will continue, until the train is off the rails for this portion of profits. 2. The shift toward AI is the main threat. When we use AI, even Gemini, we are seeking a single response, not a scavenger hunt across ten different websites, regardless of the sources are available. Most people are stupid and are done after the first response. If Google is forced to embed these simple AI summaries into its main search to maintain relevance, two things happen: Increased cost for AI results instead of the OG results. This means less profit for them. AND revenue loss. Google users need to click on ads decreases because their question has already been answered. This is headed towards becoming obsolete for Google (and anyone’s) most profitable ad format in history. Other issues: Googles cloud is under pricing its services and investing billions in infrastructure just to try and play catch up. They’re going to get their lunch eaten by Azure and AWS. Waymo and other parts of this company are high risk start-up type bets and we are forced to invest in them when buying Google. Google is notorious for creating things and throwing in the towel and spending their money poorly (the opposite of Amazon - imagine if Amazon had Google cash flow, what they’d do with it. Oh wait, they won’t, because they actually know how to reinvest properly). Also, regulatory hurdles. Google has a target on its back still. People just don’t like them.

GOOGL,1ntsp96,stocks,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/ One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries. So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share. Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",264,130,2025-09-29 20:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,2025-10-23 08:22:07.036691,0.4,$GOOGL,0.9,[],"['support', 'revenue']",1.0
GOOGL,1ocxlwm,ValueInvesting,OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas Browser Takes Direct Aim at Google Chrome ($GOOG),"OpenAI just made its biggest product move since ChatGPT: the launch of ChatGPT Atlas, a new AI-powered web browser that blends generative AI directly into search and navigation. The browser is free on macOS with Windows, iOS, and Android versions coming soon and it’s already being called the first true Chrome killer. Alphabet shares fell nearly 5% intraday, wiping billions off its market cap, as investors digested what an AI-native browser could mean for Google’s core ad business. Reports also surfaced that OpenAI’s valuation hit $500 billion, making it the world’s most valuable private company, while rival Anthropic entered talks with Google on a multi-billion-dollar cloud partnership. **Timeline of Today’s Events:** * 12:58 PM – Bloomberg Reports OpenAI is set to unveil an AI-powered web browser, putting the ChatGPT maker in direct competition with Google.

My brief thesis: * FactSet has a strong moat. The company serves institutional investors: hedge funds, asset management companies, buy-side shops, pension shops, etc... The customers either buy a FactSet terminal, or SaaS subscription. * The customer retention rate is above 90%. * Manageable debt. * Strong track record of earnings growth. * Trading at PE of 18.5 (reasonable compared to its historical average of above 25. * Revenue is still growing at a steady pace. * Risks: Primary risk is that the tool could be replaced by other AI saas products. Which is a fair fear to have, however they are so deeply integrated with customers that it will be hard to rip off FactSet and replace them with a new startup. FactSet has tons of historical data and expertise in financial data market, I would expect the management to innovate to fend off competitors. * I would like to call out that FactSet by no means is offering margin of safety like my previous investments in baba, meta, bti, and others. However it is currently trading at a fair value. * A very general example to understand FactSet: An analyst would pull the data either through api, or dashboard, transform the data with other third party and first party data to create dashboard/reports for management.

GOOGL,1nqrx0d,investing,Mid term gains to beat ETFs?,"I’ve just started investing and could use some advice on how to allocate my money. Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks. My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning. The main stocks I’m considering are: • AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side. • UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news. • SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound. I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO. I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

GOOGL,1odhh7m,stocks,Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year,"So this one really caught my eye today. Google says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer. It’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either. They’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far. I still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue. This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use. Now, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT. For now, I’m just watching how the market reacts. Google’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks. legit breakthrough, or just another shiny headline that fades in a week?",354,120,2025-10-22 19:09:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1odhh7m/everyones_chasing_nvdabut_google_just_dropped_the/,2025-10-23 08:22:07.027429,0.3,$GOOGL,0.9,[],[],0.9999999999999999
GOOGL,1o9s1f6,stocks,Google can build AI infrastructure at 1/3rd the cost of Nvidia. Implications?,"Google is going to build the first AI data center in India, a one gigawatt facility, for $15 billion. There are local partners too. Meanwhile the OpenAI-Nvidia deal showed it costs $40 - $50 billion to build the same using Nvidia technology. Now, looking ahead, say five years, it is impossible for Nvidia to sustain growth if it costs 3X to use the technology. What are the implications for Nvidia? Link - https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/our-first-ai-hub-in-india-powered-by-a-15-billion-investment/ Edit Add - At Gemini Enterprise 2.5 webcast few days ago CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's AI infrastructure processes 1.3 quadrillion tokens monthly. There is no comparable data from OpenAI but has to be a lot less. OpenAI's total processed tokens are just over 1 trillion. So **per month** Google processes 1300 times more than OpenAI **in three years since 2022 end**. That is huge. (hopefully I gave all the right facts). Obviously Google feels it is by far ahead and thus the flurry of circular deals in rest of the industry.
