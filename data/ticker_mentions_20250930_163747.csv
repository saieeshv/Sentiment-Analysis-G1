AAPL,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

AAPL,1nbchk7,investing,Does tax-loss harvesting actually do anything?,"I am 67 years old and have around $450k in my pension, two 401(k)s and an IRA. However I also have 11,200 shares of AAPL in a brokerage account with a total cost basis under $6000. So I don't want to sell anything while I am still working for fear of exceeding the $200k Obamacare tax threshold and triggering the additional 3.8% tax. I have been talking to the investment advisors at my bank who are trying to convince me to let them manage everything with the aim of using tax-lost harvesting to sell my AAPL shares and diversify before I retire at 70. Does this make any sense at all? It seems to me that eventually I will need to pay capital gains tax one way or another and my goal is to keep as much of that to 15% tax as possible.

AAPL,1nahs5r,investing,Why no Leveraged ETF under 1x?,"There’s been an explosion of leveraged funds of all different types recently, and it’s getting a little ridiculous: There are 1.5x, 2x, 3x, for indexes, sectors, industries, countries, and even individual stocks. Want 2x leverage for Japanese stocks? No problem- EZJ. Want 2x leverage for AAPL? AAPU is for you. And there’s dozens of 2x short ETFs too. But, as far as I can tell, there’s no leveraged funds between 0 and 1x, and I don’t see why. 

The benefit of leveraged funds is obviously higher yields, and the drawback is volatility decay. If the S&P 500 goes up 20$ and then back down 20$, you end up losing money with leverage. With a lower leverage, like .75, the opposite would happen. Instead of volatility decay, you’d have volatility *growth.* Something like this would actually offer upside when the stock market is flat and protect against downside while offering only slightly limiting upside in a bull market. Look at the example below:

Let’s pretend the ABC index is at 100$. It drops 4%, or 4$, then returns to where it was at $100. In this scenario, if I owned 1 share of ABC, I would end up with a 0% gain. I’d start with $100 and have exactly $100 at the end.

Now let’s say I own shares of a .75x leveraged ETF that tracks the ABC index. Let’s call this ETF ABCL. If I own $100 of ABCL, then when ABC drops by 4%, ABCL would drop 3%. I’d have 97$. But when ABC goes back up 4$, it actually grows by 4.17%. Therefore, ABCL would grow by 3.13%, which gives a total of $100.04, which is .04% above the underlying. Yeah, that’s not much, but in a flat market that’s at least something. If the market stays relatively flat over a 6-month period, those fractions of a percent would add up. Plus, there’s the downside protection. If an index drops 40% and returns to its previous high, .75x leverage puts you back at 105% at a minimum. There’s serious money to be made for anyone who can predict a big downturn.

I’ve done a bit amount of digging, and there doesn’t seem to be anything like this. Why not?",0,28,2025-09-07 02:31:11,2025-09-30 08:32:39.516049
AAPL,1n96la8,investing,Looks like Warren Buffett proved it was time for him to retire,"Just was noticing AAPL is having a good run and thought I'd look and see what price it was when BRK sold. For reference, AAPL is trading at $240 this morning, Buffett sold at $190-$200. So basically, BRK gave up a 25% gain so they could buy more 5% treasuries? Yikes.

Buffett looked like a genius in April when the tariff's first hit but for the past 6 months the S&P 500 has beat BRK 10-to-1. He's still slightly ahead of the S&P 500 YTD but over the past 12 months the S&P 500 is up 18% compared to 9% for BRK. What's interesting is BRK actually had a good run against the S&P 500 for several years, which was largely timed along his ownership of AAPL.

I understand a conglomerate like BRK sitting on cash is not necessarily the same as ""timing the market"" like us regular joes. But Warren said for years there were no good deals, while the market has continued to say otherwise.

EDIT - I'm getting a lot of grief over this. But if you look at what WB has said in the recent past, what he did with AAPL goes against the grain of what has made BRK successful. In 2021 after selling his airline positions at a loss Buffet said ""When we sell something, very often it’s going to be our entire stake: We don’t trim positions. That’s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We’re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%. If we like a business, we’re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,” he added. “And when we change our mind we don’t take half measures.” Again that quote wasn't from the 80's, that was 4 years ago.",0,36,2025-09-05 14:20:51,2025-09-30 08:32:39.516062

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1ntwo3a,investing,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that) 

For all you experienced folks out there, (redected) I cannot ask you anything apparently",0,9,2025-09-29 22:51:32,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055160
GOOGL,1nto9qg,investing,Investment advice from a friend... WDYT?,"Imagine a situation. Jonny's portfolio is fully in stocks like PLTR, IONQ, OKLO, QUBT, etc... Jonny found them up on Reddit. He's happy with the portfolio being 5x in just a year, seeing how his 10k became 50k. What a deal! At night he dreams that the next year will bring another 5x and his 50k will turn into 250k. Power of compounding! He wonders if it's a good idea to take a loan and sell his girlfriend's jewels to invest in those ""5x"" stocks. When he's a millionaire, he will shower her with diamonds.

In search of advice, Jonny comes to a friend, Kattie, whom he respects for warning him about using leverage and teaching him the concept of volatility. That saved all his money in the past.

Jonny: Hey K! What do you think about that idea? I'm really afraid I'm missing a great opportunity to get rich. Those companies are sure to be the next Nvidia, Apple, and Google. I want to take a risk and go all in.

Kattie: Dude… why do you think these companies are great investments in the first place? Have you seen the financial results and checked the valuation? The P/E and P/S ratios are so insane that I wouldn't even bother looking deeper.

Jonny: You should see what people on Reddit are saying! This is the ultimate game, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AI will replace all current jobs, and quantum will replace all modern computers. Just yesterday the CEO of that quantum stock said they're the next Nvidia. I'm already up 5x. It means something!

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

WDYT, folks? Are you with Jonny or Kattie on this one?",0,8,2025-09-29 17:27:47,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055302

GOOGL,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

GOOGL,1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",258,131,2025-09-27 10:17:01,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055458

Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

GOOGL,1npncdh,investing,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.",736,224,2025-09-24 20:38:02,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055487

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

My ""target"" Shiller PE is \~80 for 2026-2028, jumping to 300-1500 by 3032 depending on social and educational evolution being restructured by pressures from AI.",1,5,2025-09-23 23:45:25,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055514

GOOGL,1nnk8wj,investing,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year

	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.

The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",20,6,2025-09-21 09:34:11,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055622
GOOGL,1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",7,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055649

GOOGL,1njurb9,investing,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

GOOGL,1ni2rm2,investing,Financial advisor broker - should I fire,"I've been with the same advisor for the past 14 years, and my portfolio has done fairly well over the years. Have seen people with way more performance, but overall I've remained in the green (except for a few big downturns).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in. 

Thoughts? Do I move on, or give them another chance? I don't like that I'm put in a position to have to ""nag"" for trades.",8,45,2025-09-16 00:19:16,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055672

GOOGL,1nhtsh0,investing,NYT: fewer companies going public because of cumbersome corporate governance rules driven by fear of shareholder lawsuits.,"[The Quiet Force Imperiling Our Booming Stock Market](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/opinion/stock-market-corporate-governance-ipo.html)

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",82,33,2025-09-15 18:24:40,2025-09-30 08:32:45.055706
GOOGL,1ned4dy,investing,Oracle phenomena - “legacy” players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

GOOGL,1ntsp96,stocks,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",184,105,2025-09-29 20:14:20,2025-09-30 08:32:46.829827

GOOGL,1ntjtyt,stocks,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,2025-09-29 14:41:29,2025-09-30 08:32:46.829852

GOOGL,1nt6p0a,stocks,I am shorting UNH - Very High Quality Analysis,"I wrote everything myself and did not use AI. Images are not allowed here so please refer to the same post on other subs for attached screenshots of my analysis.

Alright guys, this is me going against the entire reddit world as you’ve probably seen everyone on reddit going long on UNH (including myself earlier this year where I made some really good profits on both stocks and options). I closed all my UNH positions this week.

 

And before I get into my short thesis, I’d like to get into why I bought this company in the first place. Because I am not shorting this stock because it is a bad company (To the contrary, UNH actually has a very smart business model and is a big moat business). **I am shorting because** I believe the market isn’t seeing several structural risks that could break the fundamentals in 2026.

 

**Why I went long earlier this year**:

I’ll admit, I didn’t really do a “proper” DD on this stock when I bought. I listened to the “Business Breakdown” podcast on Spotify where a UK fund manager explained why UNH is more than just a managed care company.

A few points she said that made me buy:

\- It’s a health data company with all the information in the world – kinda like the Google of healthcare (huge moat for UNH in terms of pricing & cost savings)

\- Health insurance isn’t long term (such as life insurance), so they can re-price their books in \~1+ years if they made a mistake (they have room to make mistake & fix quickly)

\- Health insurance can only earn up to \~15% from government rules (operating margin goes much lower than that as the 15% is the most), but Optum health expands their margin from Value based care: doctors get paid a fee to keep patients healthy, if patient cost is less than fees, they keep all the remaining as profit.

Value based care offers high quality service and can help patients prevent being hospitalized. This reduces insurance cost (patients who get hospitalized tend to cost significantly more vs preventative care)

\- The vertical integration between health care financer and healthcare provider is a gigantic moat & this idea just sounded smart af.

This sounded very much like a buffet-style business at the time, so I just had to look at valuations.

At the time, I did a quick valuation using the 5-year historic Operating Cashflow & CapEx growth rates to project a 5-year DCF. I did a bear, base, bull case FCF exit multiples of 10x, 15x, 20x (pretty modest). With a WACC of 7.35%, my target prices were $236 (bear), $337 (base), and $438 (bull).

 

 

**Bear thesis**:

If you looked at my valuation DCF above, you’d know that I made a good profit on UNH. The UNH market price has even climbed higher than my base-case target price of $337.

But here is the issue with my DCF, I assumed everything will carry on as it did in the past and the company will continue to grow in the same rate of growth. I also assumed the market will not further compress the multiples which are key to the valuation. And that is the core of my bear thesis:

***UNH has fundamental cracks on Optum, and they will have a very difficult time in 2026 + I think UNH is & has tried to hide it.***

The very fact that the market is going towards my earlier DCF makes me believe the market isn’t pricing in this risk. In fact, the market expanded UNH’s multiple from the Berkshire news (which I will get into later).

 

**What makes the stock price go up?**

From my bull thesis above, you could probably figure out Optum health is where the money is at – and this is what moves the needle (what ultimately makes the stock go up).

But how does this reflect on fundamentals? Let me briefly summarize what UNH is:

**UnitedHealth - What is it - It’s a 2-part business (numbers mostly from 2024 10k, screenshot of my excel attached below)**

 

**1. United Healthcare (\~40% of Revenue) – Insurance provider**

**- Employer & Individual (\~25% of healthcare revenue):** For corporations who pays for health insurance. The employer either pay a monthly premium (UNH takes the risk of claims cost) or employers pays a fixed fee for UNH to administer the health service search (UNH bears no risk).

**- Medicare & Retirement (\~50% of healthcare revenue):** For old people above age 65. Government pays a fixed fee per patient every month.

**- Community & State (\~24% of healthcare revenue):** For Medicaid, aka poor people, the state/community pays a fixed fee per month.

 

**2. Optum (\~60% of Revenue) – Healthcare provider**

**- Optum Health (\~40% of revenue):** Provides the patient care & financial services.

**- Optum Insight (\~10% of revenue):** The data & analytics business.

**-  Optum RX (\~50% of revenue):** Pharmacy care services.

(These numbers are from 10k from 2024 and 2021)

 

In short: The 2 biggest parts of UNH’s revenue are Medicare Advantage and Optum Health.

Medicare certainly moves the needle as it’s a big reason why the stock sold off this year. This is due to elevated medical claim amount /or increasing medical loss ratio for UNH - basically, old people are catching up on their knee-replacement surgeries after the COVID lockdown + playing too much pickle ball.

But for UNH, Optum Health plays an even larger role (also Medicare is the largest component of Optum Health so they add up). Not just because it brings in the most amount of revenue, but because it’s the actual growth engine for the company. If you look at UNH a decade ago, United Health (the insurance wing) was 90% of the business and Optum was only 10%. Now the roles have reversed, UNH is more Optum than insurance. As we’ve mentioned earlier, Optum helps UNH expand their margins through value-based care.

**Look at the period from 2020 – 2024**:

Optum revenue annual growth: \~13.16% vs \~8% for healthcare (it’s really \~4% if you net out eliminations)

Optum Operating Margin: \~8% vs \~5.5% for healthcare

Optum Operating income growth: \~11%+ vs \~4.75% for healthcare (yeah it grows more than double the rate of healthcare)

UNH Stock price: More than doubled in the same period. (if you count trough to peak prices: $230.1 to $630.73 that’s a 174% gain)

This isn’t the kind of stock price growth you would expect from a mature stage health insurance company growing in the single digits. This is your typical growth company with a growing topline + margin expansion (aka Optum)

 

**What did the market price in already?**

Yes. the stock price had dropped from the peak of around $600 to the mid $200s and has since rebounded to the mid $300s. It is still “cheap” when compared to previous highs. It is obvious that the market has absorbed some bad outlooks for the company. But is it really cheap?

I’ve listed out a few main things the market has priced in (up until the most recent Q2):

Optum long-term margin:

\- Earnings were $6.6 billon below management expectation in q2

\- Operating margin for the full year is guided to be 1%.

\- Management further revised down the long-term margin outlook for Optum to be 6% - 8% (from 8 - 10%).

Medical cost surge:

\- Total unexpected medical cost impact of $6.5 billion (this is a short-tail risk as they can reprice this next year)

\- Medicare advantage cost trend is more than expected (utilization of 7.5% vs 5% previously): I mean, this doesn’t add up here. Management’s Q2 earnings call said they’ve been cutting back on benefits, but they still see a growth in utilization? I think UNH has been easing claims approval due to societal pressure. (maybe this part hasn’t been priced in yet as the Medicare cost headwind will be a persistent issue from here).

\- Behavioural health in Medicaid: 20% cost growth (margins are f\*cked here as margin compression is baked into guidance in q2)

Change Healthcare

\- They suffered from a cyber-attack in early 2024 and Optum Insight is still trying to recover from this.

V28 risk model adjustment

\- I will get into the details of V28 below: Currently management said there will be $11 billion headwind over 3 years, and we have $4 billion more to go for 2026.

\- Management said they will get rid of unprofitable clients + increase price + cut cost to offset half of the $4 billion headwind in 2026. (I doubt this and will get into it below)

 

Smart Money (Berkshire Hathaway)

\-  Its kinda hard not to hit the buy button when you see the GOAT of value investing put his own money in this company.

\- My only commentary for this is: 1) Berkshire didn’t put a lot of money in it. 2) they bought before q2 earnings came out (as we are seeing more structural breakdown in q2).

 

**So, what isn’t priced in?**

**1. V28 risk model Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) Risk Adjustment Model (there is more to it…)**

Basically, this risk model is how Optum’s value-based care business gets paid.

For example, a normal patient is $1000 a month. But if this patient has a heart condition, then this HCC risk model gives him a coefficient of maybe 1.5. All of a sudden, this patient will get 1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 a month.

Before V28, UNH has been able to kind of skirt this system by aggressively diagnosing and applying elevated coefficients to get paid more.

For evidence, let’s look at DaVita Medical Group, which UnitedHealth’s Optum acquired in 2019. On a 5-year trend analysis, the risk coding jumped from 1.01x pre-acquisition to 1.5x post-acquisition. If this isn’t aggressive, I don’t know what is!

So, what did V28 do? In plain English, it’s stricter and UNH can no longer code aggressively (they got rid of 2000 diagnostic categories and flattened the weighting for some conditions – less room for a doctor to say: this guy has diabetes, and I think it’s severe, let’s give him a 2.0 instead of 1.5).

On top of that, UNH employs 10% of doctors in the U.S and with the pricing pressure + more utilization rate (aka. Old people visiting more often), I just don’t buy what management was saying (they can offset 50% of the V28 headwind next year by ‘cost savings’). I think Optum margins will be negative in 2026 and be lower than 5 - 7% long-term. And this is the structural risk to the fundamentals.

 

**2. Shady Accounting Treatment**

**a. Selling a part of their Optum business and using gains as operating income**

Considering UNH’s entire $5 billion of Optum’s operating earnings growth for 2024 came from this ‘gain on sales,’ this certainly isn’t a good look for UNH. And guess what, they have been doing this in both 2024 and 2025.

It also makes me wonder why? My thesis is that if you look at the V28 risk model revision headwind total of $11 billion over 3 years, it’s around $3 billion a year. So maybe they are using this as offset for this headwind. But regardless, they have been shady with accounting, and I think there is more to this.

*(From the 2024 10k – MD&A section*)

To add, they’ve decided to stop this in q2 this year, resulting in a $2 billion loss for Optum earnings. This means 2 things: 1) they’ve been doing this for over a year and a half; 2) They were gonna fill $2 billion of financials holes doing the same thing but just decided to stop.

(from the 2025 q2 earnings call transcript)

 

**b. Use intercompany transactions to inflate segment profitability**

While this isn’t 100% confirmed, certain industry contacts have indicated that Optum is selling services to the United Healthcare side for much more than the market price. They do this to inflate the profitability of Optum (this information is taken from Baird analyst Michael Ha’s interview video with Steve Eisman).

From a simple google search, I can also find similar headlines where UNH is upselling internally.

From reading the 2024 10k myself, I am also a bit confused at the “elimination” line in the income statement from MD&A (it’s basically the transaction between Optum and Healthcare, but since there is another line called “Optum Elimination,” this line is for the Healthcare segment). They only net out this amount in the consolidated revenue amount. However, if we take a look at the UnitedHealthcare revenue by business on page 29, they did not net out the ‘eliminations’ at all. This makes the story much more believable.

 

(from 2024 10k, yeah, they didn’t net out eliminations)

 

**Valuation + Price Target**

My new assumptions (that isn’t even too pessimistic):

Operating cashflow stays flat for 2025 & 2026 and resumes a 1% growth from 2027 to 2029.

CapEx grows at the same 5-year CAGR historical rate (assuming they need to maintain their business).

And the reason why my assumptions aren’t too pessimistic is because my 2025 FCF is $20 billion (much higher than management’s Q2 guidance of $16 billion). They also didn’t mention any plans regarding CapEx but I am being more than generous to maintain historical growth rate as they definitely will need more CapEx to maintain (given their elevated utilization rate – rumor has it that UNH has been easing the claims approval process due to public pressure. Otherwise, this story won’t add up cuz their benefits are less rich compared to national average).

 

(source: my shitty excel sheet)

**Target price**: I think we can at least see the low $200s (maybe even lower) if my thesis plays out. But I’ll start to take profit once we get below $ 250 by selling some poor-man-covered-puts. I will get into details on my executions below.

 

**Shorting Strategy, Position, and Execution Plans:**

**Strategy**: Synthetic Short (kinda) with a long call to cap my loss:

 Sell 300/350 Dec 2027 Credit Call Spread + Buy 300 Jan 2028 LEAPS Put

**Position**:

 

Premium from Call Spread: $9,794.8 - $7,461.25 = $2,333.55

Debit for LEAPS Put: ($4,105.2)

Net Debit: ($1,771.65)

Max Loss Possible: $5,000 + $4,105.2 - $2,333.55 = $6,771.65

 

**Execution Plan**:

**Take profit**: If we drop below \~$250, I will start selling 30 DTE puts and close my call spread position to de-risk. I will fully exit my positions once we drop below $200 or my thesis has played out where Optum blows up.

**Stop loss**: I will hold till early 2027 and see if my thesis has played about/hasn’t played out/has yet to play out. I will hold up to the 45 DTE point and exit regardless.

 

**Conclusion**: I think this company is a short because the story isn’t over yet. Not because UNH a bad company, but because the structural cracks (Optum: V28 + Shady Accounting + Optum margin reset) aren’t fully priced in yet and people are already celebrating on the Berkshire bandwagon.",0,30,2025-09-29 02:32:46,2025-09-30 08:32:46.829933

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1nq3oqn,stocks,Copper price spikes on Freeport’s Grasberg force majeure,"https://www.mining.com/copper-price-spikes-on-freeports-grasberg-force-majeure/#google_vignette

Copper prices jumped Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) declared force majeure on contracted supplies from its Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",35,2,2025-09-25 11:00:13,2025-09-30 08:32:46.829967

GOOGL,1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",253,114,2025-09-24 21:14:03,2025-09-30 08:32:46.829987

GOOGL,1nny89w,stocks,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",1,19,2025-09-22 20:51:16,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830026

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

GOOGL,1nnk82c,stocks,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

GOOGL,1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",44,47,2025-09-20 18:07:12,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830080
GOOGL,1nm2ecd,stocks,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can’t lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

They just 5x their yearly revenue, but the stock is only up 40% on the announcement

Edit: just to add: I think people are underestimating the experience at nebius. Nebius comes out of yandex, which was the Google of Eastern Europe. Know for being a great company to work for who looked after their employees, the ceo was very against the Ukraine invasion, fled, took the top talent with him, and know you are look at a 20b market cap company that has people with experience of scaling world leading tech, and who are looking to make a stand",290,171,2025-09-20 16:17:43,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830091
GOOGL,1nlylxt,stocks,Why is using maximum margin to buy and hold long term a bad idea when the numbers say otherwise?,"Everyone always says using margin is a terrible idea, it’s super risky etc.  right now I have a $100,000 trading account, let’s say 5 years ago I used my full maximum margin to simply invest $300,000 to buy GOOGL ($200,000 of which would be from margin). Even after all the interest you would pay on the margin funds, I would practically be a millionaire.  

Let’s be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?  

Sure Google could or whatever company could be the next Enron and you lose it all, but that risk is no different than you taking out a big business loan to start a business and your business fails.  What am I missing?",0,50,2025-09-20 13:46:25,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830098

GOOGL,1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",117,56,2025-09-19 11:50:52,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830109

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

GOOGL,1ne09jg,stocks,"$BYRN DD: It's Mispriced, and I think it'll pop by October 8th. I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)


Thank you regards for reading this far. The same fundamentals as any other slept-on stock applies to this one. Buy and hold, check the next interest report coming out on 09/15, etcetera. If any oldheads read this post, please fact check my ass. I'm trying to navigate this into as much profit as I can possibly take myself.

GOOGL,1nctxgv,stocks,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

GOOGL,1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

GOOGL,1nbwetv,stocks,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,90,2025-09-08 18:54:56,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830251

Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",713,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830289

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google’s ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney’s current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a “big win” for Apple.

“This has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they’ve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,” he said. Some stocks like MS, GS, AXP, BGM, RXRX are in my watchlist because I think these Google's move may have impacts on these AI stuff.

In a landmark case filed in 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Google kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in August 2024 that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies, saying the company has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.

Google said it will appeal the ruling, which would delay any potential penalties.

GOOGL,1n6cctp,stocks,Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio,"Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!

I understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it’s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven’t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I’m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

  
Curious to know what everyone thinks and what their feedback is!",7,11,2025-09-02 06:40:33,2025-09-30 08:32:46.830370

MSFT,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying.

Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

MSFT,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.",53,28,2025-09-12 02:57:35,2025-09-30 08:32:53.799141

TSLA,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

- If orange man dies, Vance becomes president. This propels PLTR to be the president’s stock, just as TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency. Tesla kept going up, until tensions between trump and musk were getting bad.

AMZN,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

I ran the numbers and, when both portfolios are combined, 40% of my holdings are AMZN. 

My AMZN portfolio is +30% overall. I know I'm overweight in AMZN due to the shares given to me. I want to sell about half of the AMZN shares and put that money into SPY and bonds. 

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares. 

Given the tax implications, what's a sound strategy I should do? Continue holding all AMZN in my one port? Sell a portion and redistribute?

AMZN,1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,2025-09-30 08:33:02.018434

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it’s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven’t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I’m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

NVDA,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"".

AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day.

I do believe AI is the “Next Big Thing” when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand.

NVDA,1niyk3r,investing,"IONQ and other Quantum stocks are rising insanely, is it worth to invest?","I noticed IONQ's presentation on investors' day, and they shared some information about achieving targets, and also had one slide where they presented the revenue, which is doubling every year. But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|

|**Q2 2025 (quarter ended June 30, 2025)**|**US$20.7 million**|**US$-85.6 million**|
|Q1 2025|Q1 revenue is $7.57 million|**US$**\-33M|
|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**− US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2023**|**US$22.04 million**|**US$-78.81 million**\~   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

But in 2020 I could see these were unusual times. High quality energy companies were trading at a fraction of their traditional prices so I bought some and they've returned 300+% and return 6+% on cost. Same thing happened in 2021 with REITs, 2022 with EU banks etc. All have far out-returned SP500 and give me a very healthy dividend.

They even fabricate weird scenarios such as if I had bought SPY at the very bottom of 2020 I'd be far ahead of where I am now. Even on the weekend at a party someone working in semi-conductors said he went all in on NVDA, TMSC etc and it's set them up for early retirement the argument was he could have retired earlier if he just invested in index funds!

The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings & Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi & AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",5,0,2025-09-29 16:05:17,2025-09-30 08:33:08.750673
NVDA,1nso3q8,stocks,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,2025-09-28 13:17:00,2025-09-30 08:33:08.750694

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

Do you think there's an underlying risk here? Or will this just last forever until eventually companies like OpenAI start making mountains of profits?

NVDA,1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks… are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn’t new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren’t perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies.

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

META,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

META,1nqlo50,investing,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,15,2025-09-25 23:14:01,2025-09-30 08:33:11.885801

I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",6,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,2025-09-30 08:33:11.885822
META,1niyxh1,investing,Why today’s Nvidia–CoreWeave deal is a red flag for Oracle,"oracle pumped their stock saying ai demand is going to double. key word = *future*. they’re selling investors on what’s coming, not what’s actually happening today.

meanwhile, nvidia just cut a $6.3B deal to backstop coreweave’s unsold gpu capacity through 2032, and another $1.5B leaseback with lambda.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

so oracle’s forecast = hopium about tomorrow.  
nvidia’s actions = reality check today.

META,1ned4dy,investing,Oracle phenomena - “legacy” players pushing AI reaction?,"The recent case of Oracle got me thinking about the state of the markets, the AI hype and reality, and what it means for the future.

I’ve been pretty skeptical about Oracle’s surge, but they are about to recognize a lot of revenues. This market reaction is interesting because so far, the “big AI” bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we’re seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, “old guard” player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say. Ideally, markets should value not just AI mentions and vision, but the actual value being unlocked. Maybe that’s exactly what’s being priced in here or maybe it’s an over- or underreaction, since we still don’t fully understand what AI will ultimately deliver.

Ofc there is lot more to Oracle than this but still im very curiousy

I’m curious to hear your take: are investors overestimating, underestimating, or pricing it just right? What do you think?:/",7,5,2025-09-11 16:18:54,2025-09-30 08:33:11.885847

* Savings: me \~6k, her \~8k
* Combined monthly expenses: \~1,100 € (rent, utilities, etc.) + \~400 € food
* Car: lease 250 €/mo, gas 40 €/mo, insurance 787 € every 6 months (service included)
* My computer loan: 153 €/mo until Aug 2026
* Personal spending: \~300 € (me), \~500–550 € (her)

**Income:**

* Until now: 2,500 € net combined
* Starting Oct: 5,600 € net combined
* Plus I own a business with my father abroad → 20–24k €/year net dividends, usually paid once yearly (can also leave it in the business).

**Investments so far:**

* Retirement plan with MetLife: 2,107.5 € every 6 months (invested in Amundi + iShares ETFs – global + emerging markets).
* Goal: Buy a home in our home country in 1–2 years (cost \~400k incl. renovations/garage). Plan is to use business dividends as down payment.

**Our question:**  
From October we’ll be able to save around 3k/month. How much of that should we actually invest, and how?

* Put some/all into something broad like the S&P 500?
* Take more concentrated bets on Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Apple (higher risk but maybe higher return)?
* Or use a different approach, given that we also want to buy a house in 1–2 years?",2,14,2025-09-09 12:52:41,2025-09-30 08:33:11.885856

META,1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",262,114,2025-09-24 21:14:03,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585394

META,1nlf722,stocks,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

What’s do you guys think about Sprout Social?",5,2,2025-09-19 20:54:37,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585450
META,1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",114,56,2025-09-19 11:50:52,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585453

META,1njv8wk,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

META,1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing.",51,28,2025-09-12 02:57:35,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585494
META,1nd8ojp,stocks,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing? 

Thank you again for reading!",7,18,2025-09-10 08:33:18,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585498
META,1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

META,1nbtqdf,stocks,Remember all those times you should have taken profits?,"But then you thought you could get even more. So what did you do? You held (and maybe even bought more).

Then, whatever position you had went down 10-35%. And all of a sudden it's harder to justify selling.

Contrarily, there are also those times when you took profits, only to see the stock rip for another 3X gain (in my case, META).

Now think about the overall stock market right now. How would you feel if you sold your positions today? 

How would you feel if they went up another 10-35%? How would you feel if they declined 10-35% on average? And, most importantly, what are the odds either scenario will occur given your track record with such matters?",0,35,2025-09-08 17:16:27,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585509
META,1n6cctp,stocks,Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio,"Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!

I understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it’s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven’t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I’m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

  
Curious to know what everyone thinks and what their feedback is!",7,11,2025-09-02 06:40:33,2025-09-30 08:33:13.585535
