Will India replace Iranian oil with Russian oil?,"Speculation is growing over the impact of snapback of UN sanctions on Iran's oil sector, with some analysts cautioning that Tehran could possibly lose its largest customer, China, for it does not want to antagonize the US. ""The 25-year-old Iran-China treaty cannot be fruitful because China prioritizes trade with the West and the United States. It should be noted that China has $600 billion in trade with the United States, which is why China will not take any action that would disrupt its trade,"" energy expert Hashem Oraee told Mehr News Agency. Oraee also pointed out that Russia as Iran's competitor in the global energy market, is unlikely to help Tehran boost production, given both countries rely on Asian buyers such as India and China to offset their inability to sell crude to the West. Because in that case, Iran gains more market share. Bloomberg reported last week that Indian officials have informed Washington that a significant reduction in Russian oil imports by the South Asian country's refineries would require Washington to allow New Delhi to buy crude from Iran and Venezuela. According to informed sources, India had emphasized that a simultaneous cut in oil supplies to Indian refineries from Russia, Iran and Venezuela, all major oil producers, could lead to a rise in global prices. India's Ministry of Commerce confirmed earlier this month that in June it imported $111 million worth of crude from Iran, marking the first such shipment since New Delhi halted purchases in 2018 under US pressure. Between January and July, India also brought in $94 million worth of refined petroleum products from Iran. In total, Iranian exports of crude and petroleum products to India in the first seven months of 2025 amounted to $205 million, accounting for 54 percent of all Iranian exports to the country. India consumes roughly 4.7 million barrels of crude daily, nearly 40 percent of which has recently been supplied by cheap Russian oil. Should India scale back imports, they could face a two-million-barrel shortfall, which can play into Iran and Venezuela hands. Both countries are under sanctions but offering steep discounts and are be well-positioned to address this gap. Hamid Hosseini, spokesman for Iran's Union of Petroleum Products Exporters, told Mehr News Agency that India has already floated the idea of replacing Russian oil with Iranian's. He said that none of Iran's exports to India are restricted by UN resolutions. Technically, Iran's heavy grades are among the closest substitutes for Russia's Urals blend. Both have similar API gravity and sulfur levels, making Iranian crude an easy fit for Indian refineries designed for Urals without costly modifications. The compatibility reduces downtime and operational costs, while Iran's willingness to offer flexible payment mechanisms, including rupee-denominated deals and barter arrangements, further strengthens its appeal.

North American Morning Briefing :  Stock Futures Fall as Government Shutdown Begins,"Stock futures declined with investors on edge as the government shutdown began . ""Historically shutdowns have been bad for the dollar, bad for equities, and bad for bonds too,"" Hargreaves Lansdown said. ""This is an unwelcome event for a market that has been on a tear since the tariff-induced lows of April, and had been building positive momentum thanks to the AI boom, a Federal Reserve rate cut and a near end to tariff uncertainty."" Danske Bank said the direct economic impact is expected to be limited but markets will likely focus on potential delays to the publication of data , particularly Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, and possible layoffs of public sector workers. ""While these factors might not significantly alter the macroeconomic outlook, they could, all else being equal, modestly increase the likelihood of the Fed considering a rate cut in October."" The latest data pointed to lackluster labor market conditions , boosting expectations for further interest-rate cuts in the coming months. The ADP private employment report is expected today , which may be the only broad national measure of job growth that markets get for a while. Stocks to Watch Acuity, Cal-Maine Foods and Conagra Brands are expected to report results before the bell. AES: BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is nearing a $38 billion takeover of the utility group, according to a media report. AES shares shot up 14% premarket. A U.S. court dismissed Arm's allegation that a Qualcomm unit violated a licensing agreement. Arm shares fell around 2% before the bell. GEO Group received a contract from Immigration and Customs Enforcement for continued provision of electronic monitoring and supervision services. The stock rose 4% after the bell. The U.S. government said Tuesday it would take a 5% stake in both Lithium Americas and its Nevada mining project. Shares jumped by roughly one-third in premarket trading. Nike posted a surprise sales increase for last quarter, but raised its tariff-cost forecast to $1.5 billion this fiscal year. Shares climbed 3% ahead of the open. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental's petrochemical unit for around $10 billion. Occidental shares rose over 1% in premarket trading.

Why Billions More Are Flowing Their Way. - A Once Unstoppable Luxury Housing Market Is Starting to Crack The dollar fell against a basket of currencies following the government shutdown. It could weaken further as investors are fearful that this could be longer than previous shutdowns , ING said. That could weigh further on consumer confidence and job security, especially if Trump follows through on his threats to fire non-essential government staff, it said. The euro remained higher against the dollar , barely moving after eurozone inflation rose in line with expectations in September. Bonds: Treasury yields rose as the government shutdown began. Treasury operations remained unaffected as the debate isn't linked to the debt ceiling this time, Julius Baer said. ""As such, unless prolonged, the event is politically highly sensitive but unlikely to disrupt bond markets by itself significantly."" MainSky said that Treasurys are the clear winners when looking at the three shutdowns lasting more than 14 days. ""Yields on ten-year Treasury bonds have fallen during all shutdowns,"" it said. ""The uncertainty creates demand for safe assets."" Energy: Oil prices edged higher in early trade, before turning lower. ""September marked a second straight monthly drop for crude, reflecting persistent supply concerns,"" MUFG said. Metals: Gold prices climbed to a fresh record as investors turned to safe-haven assets. Gold Chart Comex gold futures were on track to test resistance at $4,000/oz, RHB Retail Research said, according to the daily chart. The ""higher high"" closing, together with the relative strength index pointing upward, reaffirmed strong bullish momentum is in play. Copper Copper remained largely flat , supported by concerns over risks to supply. A mudslide at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia has worsened the supply outlook, taking 3% of global mine supply offline, ANZ said. China's crackdown on excess competition and overcapacity was also expected to reduce refined copper production. The Company Founders Who Think They Need Not One but Two Successors Finally convinced it is time to step aside, company founders often decide it takes two people to fill their big shoes-despite the mixed record of companies led by co-CEOs. Spotify's Daniel Ek is the latest entrepreneur to be succeeded by a pair of chief executives. The music streaming giant announced Tuesday that co-presidents Alex Norström and Gustav Söderström will become its co-CEOs on Jan. 1. Oracle, founded by Larry Ellison, just announced its second pair of co-CEOs in 11 years. Comcast, too, picked a co-CEO to join longtime leader Brian Roberts, whose father founded the media company in 1963.

Lower Rates Could Help These Unloved Bank Stocks Shine Things are shaping up for regional banks. Shares of smaller lenders have had a poor run against their bigger peers in recent years. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, which tracks 24 of the largest U.S. lenders, is up almost 20% so far this year. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index, which tracks 50 smaller lenders, is up only 1%. The performance gap was over 20 percentage points in 2024. Today's ADP Jobs Data Will Matter. The Government Shutdown Might Delay BLS's Numbers. Economists expect the latest data to show that September proved to be another weak month for hiring in the private sector. The monthly ADP National Employment Report for September is set to be released at 8:15 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday. Economists surveyed by FactSet expect that the U.S. private employers added 50,000 jobs in September. That's down slightly from the 54,000 positions that ADP reported in August, with sectors such as leisure and hospitality and construction gaining ground despite the broader slowdown in hiring. Eurozone Inflation Picks Up Pace as ECB Looks Set to Keep Rates on Hold Annual inflation accelerated in the eurozone last month, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank will leave its key interest rate unchanged for what is left of this year. Consumer prices were 2.2% higher than a year earlier in September, picking up pace from the 2.0% rate of inflation booked in August, and in line with economists' expectations. Stronger-than-expected rises in inflation in key economies like Germany pushed the rate higher for the 20-nation currency union as a whole. Energy prices fell at less sharp rate on year in September than they did in August, contributing a large part of the headline rise in inflation across the eurozone. Powerful Earthquake Kills at Least 69 People in Central Philippines A powerful earthquake collapsed buildings and set off several landslides in the central Philippines, killing at least 69 people and injuring hundreds more, officials said Wednesday.

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",Yahoo,2025-10-01T10:12:31Z,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-fourth-101231023.html,2025-10-01 18:29:59.944762,-0.05882352941176472

Africa's Startup Acceleration: Lessons From The Big Four - African Leadership Magazine,"In the first half of 2025, the African startup ecosystem appears to have regained momentum, with disclosed funding surging and investor confidence returning. Yet behind the positive numbers lies a structural reality: Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa, often referred to as the ""Big Four"" continue to dominate capital allocation across the continent. Their outsized share raises serious questions about equity, growth bottlenecks in smaller ecosystems, and the risk of reinforcing regional imbalances. Across Africa, startups raised approximately US$1.055 billion in the first five months of 2025, marking a 40 percent increase over the same period in 2024. Broader estimates place the total for H1 2025 at US$1.35 billion, a rebound that represents a 78 percent rise compared to the roughly US$800 million in H1 2024. These headline numbers suggest a revived investor appetite after years of constrained growth. In 2024, ecosystem-wide funding had declined: startups obtained about US$2.2 billion in fundraising, a 25 percent drop from 2023 levels. That downtrend had sparked fears of a prolonged ""funding winter,"" but 2025's early data offers cautious optimism. More importantly, the rebound is observable in deal dynamics: venture capital and private equity deal volumes in Q1 2025 accounted for roughly US$1 billion across 109 deals, with early-stage VC showing 9 percent year-on-year volume growth. In Q2 2025, deal value increased by 38 percent year-on-year, and venture deal volume in H1 was up 11 percent relative to H1 2024. These metrics suggest that capital is flowing not just in a handful of mega-rounds but into more diversified stages of growth. Yet this flow is overwhelmingly concentrated. From the outset of 2025, the Big Four have drawn the lion's share of funding. In Q1, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa each received about US$100 million (24 percent, 24 percent, and 22 percent respectively) while Egypt followed with about US$61 million (14 percent). Combined, these four accounted for roughly 83 percent of disclosed funding across the continent. In H1 2025, the dominance deepened, with the Big Four capturing 78 percent of activity. Reports also place South Africa's share at 26 percent, Nigeria's at 15 percent, and Kenya's at 12 percent. In effect, the rest of the continent is left competing for the remaining 20-25 percent of capital, a structural imbalance with long-term implications. Fintech remains the most heavily funded sector, pulling in about 45 percent of disclosed funding in the first half of the year. Other sectors such as energy, logistics, healthtech, climate tech, and AI are growing in investor interest but still receive only a fraction compared to fintech's share. From a global standpoint, such concentration is not unique. In many mature startup ecosystems, the majority of venture capital gravitates to a few cities or hubs (for example, Silicon Valley in the U.S., London and Berlin in Europe). However, in those markets, informal buffers such as spillover effects and regional satellite offices soften inequalities. In Africa, where infrastructure, regulatory regimes, institutional frameworks, and connectivity vary vastly, the gravitational pull toward a few ecosystems imposes a steeper cost. First, smaller and emerging ecosystems in East, Central, and West Africa beyond the Big Four struggle to retain talent and raise marquee rounds. Because capital is scarce, many promising startups must relocate (or remain nascent) to attract serious funding. This brain drain across borders contributes to a feedback loop where investors view only the dominant hubs as ""safe bets,"" reinforcing the stranglehold. Second, region-wide risk becomes concentrated. Political or economic shocks in the Big Four (currency risk, policy insecurity, regulatory clampdowns) can disproportionately ripple through continental portfolios. When capital is less diversified geographically, systemic vulnerability increases. Third, innovation becomes less inclusive. Problems unique to small or rural markets may go unaddressed when most venture capital is chasing scale within dense, urban hubs. The result is that innovation is shaped by the demands of a few markets, potentially leaving large segments of the continent underserved. Finally, dependence on foreign capital, especially from global VCs risks misalignment with local needs, timing, and resilience. If foreign investors back only in the Big Four, they further entrench those hubs relative to peripheral ones. Kenya has long been a leading East African hub, leveraging success stories in mobile payments and renewable energy startups. Still, Kenya's share in H1 2025 (12 percent) makes it vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment. Nigeria remains a powerhouse in population, consumer base, and developer talent. Its 15 percent share in H1 2025 underscores strength, but the country wrestles with macroeconomic volatility, currency depreciation, inflation, and regulatory uncertainty. South Africa offers infrastructure, strong universities, and relative regulatory sophistication. Its 26 percent share is the largest among the Big Four, but the country faces challenges in inequality, social unrest, and confidence in policy continuity. Egypt is emerging strongly. In 2025's early funding rounds, Egypt often leads in deal volume and is crafting regulatory reforms to support startups. Its ability to bridge the Arab and African markets gives it strategic appeal, but foreign exchange risk and local bureaucracy remain headwinds. Each country's dominance is enabled by stronger institutional ecosystems, deeper investor networks, better legal systems, and, crucially, higher visibility. Those are advantages that many emerging ecosystems still lack. For startups situated outside the Big Four, the environment is increasingly challenging. When capital flows predominantly to a few, the barriers to entry in underfunded regions become steeper. Founders must exert more effort to signal credibility, often relocating or aligning with partners in the Big Four just to get noticed. Local venture funds and angel networks play a critical role in bridging the gap, but many are undercapitalised, underexposed, or lacking deep domain experience. In many African ecosystems, early-stage financing remains largely informal or reliant on diaspora networks. This constrains scaling potential before the ""growth"" stages, when large check sizes become necessary. In some cases, regional or cross-border fund structures are attempting to redress the balance. But these often still anchor in the Big Four as operational centres, thereby reinforcing the structural bias. Moreover, smaller ecosystems tend to suffer from weaker infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty, and limited startup support systems such as accelerators, mentors, and legal counsel. The imbalance in capital exacerbates those disadvantages, making it harder to build self-sustaining ecosystems. Finally, the talent pool often migrates. Engineers, product designers, and founders may relocate to Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt or South Africa because of better opportunities, leaving peripheral markets with a brain drain. To counter the chokehold, several strategies merit attention. Regional capital decentralisation is essential, with development finance institutions, multilateral funds, and impact investors purposefully channelling funding into emerging ecosystems to alter investor perceptions of risk. Alongside this, capacity building and ecosystem strengthening in smaller markets must be prioritised through legal reform, reliable regulation, better connectivity, and tailored acceleration programmes, with success in even one or two non-Big Four markets capable of breaking investor inertia. Collaboration and knowledge transfer across ecosystems should also be institutionalised, enabling the Big Four's networks to mentor and incubate startups in smaller hubs, thereby giving founders visibility among global investors while maintaining local roots. Furthermore, innovative financing instruments such as revenue-based financing, local currency debt, and hybrid models can reduce reliance on foreign venture capital, which often favours low-risk, high-visibility markets. Finally, improved reporting and greater data transparency would ease due diligence for investors exploring new geographies, while institutional support in standardising deal disclosures could strengthen the credibility of smaller ecosystems. The resurgence in 2025 is encouraging, but the dominance of the Big Four suggests the continent is not yet on a level playing field. As capital tightens globally, investors may retreat to their safest bets, which could further entrench the funding stranglehold unless corrective action is taken. On the opportunity side, there is increased interest in sectors beyond fintech. Climate tech, healthtech, agritech, and AI are gaining traction, especially in markets underserved by large players. Investors willing to look beyond the Big Four may capture outsized returns if they back local founders solving deep, localised problems. Another bright spot is cross-border tech adoption. Startups that can scale horizontally across smaller markets, linking regional demand may find compelling growth paths without needing to relocate to the Big Four.",African Leadership Magazine,2025-10-01T09:46:23Z,https://www.africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk/africas-startup-acceleration-lessons-from-the-big-four/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.947150,0.3019607843137255

Mia Mottley defends free movement agreement ahead of Oct 1 launch - WIC News,"Barbados: Prime Minister Mia Mottley has defended Barbados' decision to join other three CARICOM states in the Free Movement initiative aimed at interconnectedness and development between the Caribbean countries. Barbados, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Belize aim to fully open their borders to the citizens of the four nations from today (October 1) onwards. Prime Minister Mia Mottley addressed Barbados in Tuesday night's national address insisting the move will be carefully managed across the four Caribbean nations pioneering the fully reciprocal free movement agreement. ""What my friends this regime is not, it is not a free for all,"" she said in her September 30 address, delivered just hours before the island formally joined three other member states in pioneering free movement across the region. Prime Minister Mottley noted that the Free Movement regime is not a free for all neither is it an abandonment of border control, or a threat to Barbadian jobs and services as professionals will still require adherence to the rules and regulations governing the practices of their professions in Barbados after having licenses to operate in the country. ""No one can simply walk into Barbados and set up a practice. Freedom of movement does not remove the need for persons moving into a country to comply with the legal requirements."" Prime Minister Mottley further stated that the professional service registrations must still be followed citing that lawyers for example will still require a valid practice certificate, as will any profession which is regulated under legislation. ""It is not a one way arrangement which benefits others and leaves the locals of Barbados behind, it is not a sudden leap into the unknown, it is measured, it is managed, it is ours,"" Prime Minister Mottley assured the Barbados citizens that the Free Movement agreement between the four countries is managed and regulated. She added that it will further not only improve the lives of other citizens whose countries are also involved in the agreement, but will also improve the lives of the Barbados citizens by allowing them to travel freely and have more opportunities. Free Movement is set to begin from October 1, benefiting the citizens of Barbados, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Belize with various opportunities that can be shared across the four island nations.",WIC News,2025-10-01T10:28:12Z,https://wicnews.com/barbados/mia-mottley-defends-free-movement-agreement-ahead-of-oct-1-launch,2025-10-01 18:29:59.948774,0.07450980392156858
Londeka aims to reduce logistics inefficiency,"Young Namibian innovators have introduced an innovative development for the domestic digital economy by introducing an online logistics platform designed to connect empty trucks with available loads. Called Londeka, the platform directly tackles one of the industry's greatest challenges, namely empty trucks traveling long distances. Through the platform on www.londeka.com, truck drivers can receive cargo, packages and parcels for delivery, ensuring every return journey is optimised for productivity and efficiency. The platform is simple and user-friendly: users sign up, post their load, get matched with an available truck, and then track and deliver. Founder of Londeka, Marthin Shigwedha, explained the inspiration behind the platform ""It is imperative that we as young people create avenues that will contribute to the growth of our country. Londeka was created to be a visionary that will lead Namibia into the global space,"" he noted. Adding to this, Mignon Nekuta, managing director of Londeka, emphasised the platform's potential to reshape trade and transportation while empowering both businesses and communities. ""Londeka is more than just a logistics platform; it is a statement that young Namibians are ready to build solutions that drive our economy forward. By connecting businesses, communities and drivers, we are creating an environment that supports growth, trade and opportunity for all,"" she stated. The youth-led solution aims to transform the transport and logistics sector by reducing inefficiencies, creating new economic opportunities, and positioning Namibia as a hub for innovation-driven growth with global potential. Michael Shimwandi, head of new business at Londeka, highlighted the platform's impact on truck drivers. ""With Londeka, drivers are at the heart of logistics. We ensure that the trips are profitable and efficient. By reducing empty trips, we not only help drivers earn more but also contribute to a greener, smarter transportation industry,"" he highlighted. More than just a logistics platform, Londeka marks the dawn of a new age of youth-driven innovation in Namibia. It showcases originality, entrepreneurship, and the determination of young people to turn obstacles into possibilities. By leveraging digital technology, the initiative closes gaps, increases productivity, and strengthens Namibia's economy. Although Londeka is starting in Namibia, its vision is global. With scalability built into the system, the goal is to expand across Africa and beyond, connecting industries, communities and economies. In a statement issued this week, Londeka urged businesses, truck owners and logistics stakeholders to join their revolutionary journey and celebrate the role of Namibian youth in driving the country into the digital age.",New Era Live,2025-10-01T10:28:32Z,https://neweralive.na/londeka-aims-to-reduce-logistics-inefficiency/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.949463,0.4666666666666666
Athens Jail program helps women learn construction skills to build a new start,"Jasmine Peters had never imagined this would be her reality behind bars. ""I always wanted to learn a new trade and here I am getting it in one of the places, last places, I thought I would have gotten it,"" Peters told CBS News Atlanta. She, along with other women at the Athens-Clarke County Jail, is a part of the Future Foundations Jail Resident Construction Program. Students learn hands-on trade skills, including how to read a measuring tape and how to utilize hand and power tools. Peters has been helping to build a playhouse to be auctioned at the Clarke County Sheriff's Office Fall Festival this October. ""[The program] brought us closer because most of the girls here are in my unit, where we sleep and shower and eat together,"" she said. Peters said she has been incarcerated for about two months and has been keeping herself busy with what she calls a life-altering trade program. ""When I'm working in here, all I'm thinking about is how I can utilize this when I get out, job opportunities that will be available for me,"" she said. Jonathan Sims, the program manager, started these classes at the jail in 2024. He said a graduating class can range anywhere from 9 to 15 women. Sims teaches these eight-hour workshops every other week and helps them connect with potential employers. ""The construction industry is the most forgiving industry there is when it comes to hiring people who have criminal records, getting out of jail, starting over. They look more toward hiring people who have some knowledge and experience,"" Sims told CBS News Atlanta. ""Even though they are in jail, this gives them the opportunity to experience what working on a jobsite looks like, what the overall workforce looks for, and they can go out and talk to companies after they get out of here,"" he added. Staff added that some of the goals of the program are to reduce recidivism through career readiness and also help place those formerly incarcerated into affordable housing. ""A lot more resources for men than they offer for women, so this is opening up a box and giving them the tool to fit in their belt to find a job,"" Lt. Gary Davenport of the Athens-Clarke County Jail told CBS News Atlanta. As for Peters, she is looking forward to finishing up the playhouse. But to her, it's more than just a trade program. It's a symbol of hope. ""Since my incarceration inside those walls, and inside these walls, I learned that it's never too late to start over,"" Peters said. ""Sometimes we make mistakes, but just undo it and take a second, start over.""",CBS News,2025-10-01T10:28:21Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/athens-jail-program-helps-women-learn-construction-skills-to-build-a-new-start/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.949975,0.1529411764705881
"AI-Trained Payments Fraud Detection System Under Works, RBI Says","RBI MPC Proposes Risk-Based Deposit Insurance Premium For Banks Last month, the RBI proposed new norms that will allow digital payment providers to implement additional risk-based checks beyond the mandatory two-factor authentication for certain transactions. The new measures are designed to enhance security by applying extra scrutiny to transactions that have a high-risk perception, thereby reducing the potential for fraud. The proposed norms are also intended to foster a more open and flexible digital payments ecosystem. They facilitate interoperability and open access to technology, which could lead to greater innovation and a more seamless experience for consumers and businesses alike. Further, the new regulations will clearly define the responsibilities of card issuers. They will be mandated to validate the Additional Factor of Authentication or AFA in non-recurring, cross-border card-not-present or CNP transactions whenever a request is made by the overseas merchant or acquiring bank. This clarification aims to streamline the process for international payments and ensure a consistent level of security. Data security and transaction frauds have been a key issue for the banking regulator as Indians have increasingly used digital platforms like UPI for everyday and large transactions. Such payment mechanisms can expose both customers and financial institutions to sophisticated risks.",NDTV Profit,2025-10-01T10:18:41Z,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/economy-finance/artificial-intelligence-trained-payments-fraud-detection-system-under-works-rbi-says,2025-10-01 18:29:59.950248,0.3176470588235294
SHIB Whale Exit Sparks Debate Over Which Crypto to Buy Today for Long-Term Compounding ROI,"The recent exit of a major SHIB whale has ignited intense discussions among retail investors about the next cryptocurrency to buy for long-term compounding returns. While some traders are cautious amid recent volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising candidate for sustained growth. Its structured lending and borrowing system, combined with a robust presale performance, positions it as a platform with both utility and potential for significant appreciation. Retail investors tracking crypto charts are increasingly comparing the traditional memecoins with DeFi protocols that offer tangible financial benefits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, with 170 million tokens allocated and approximately $16.6 million raised so far. Over 16,650 holders have joined, and 53% of the phase is already sold, highlighting strong market interest. The upcoming Phase 7 will increase the token price to $0.040, creating urgency for early investors to participate before the price rises. The platform's innovative features, combined with Layer-2 integration, will significantly reduce transaction costs and speed up operations compared to traditional Layer-1 networks, making it an attractive option for both retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a powerful P2C lending system where users can deposit stablecoins or blue-chip tokens to earn attractive yields. For example, a user depositing $18,000 USDD will receive mtUSDD at a 1:1 ratio and earn around 16% APY, generating $2,880 annually in passive income. Borrowers can also leverage their holdings without losing exposure to the underlying asset; a $1,200 LINK deposit allows borrowing up to 68%, enabling liquidity access while retaining potential gains from LINK price appreciation. P2P lending caters to higher-risk tokens such as PEPE and FLOKI creating isolated pools that safeguard the core liquidity while letting lenders negotiate interest rates, durations, and partial fills. The platform's collateral and liquidation mechanisms are designed to protect users and maintain stability. Every loan is overcollateralized, and the Stability Factor continuously monitors collateral health. If collateral falls below required thresholds, liquidators step in to purchase debt at a discount, ensuring system safety. Market volatility and liquidity considerations are central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)'s (MUTM) design. Adequate liquidity ensures distressed positions can be closed efficiently, while low-liquidity assets trigger higher incentives for liquidators. Loan-to-value ratios are carefully assigned: stablecoins and ETH can reach 75% LTV with an 80% liquidation threshold, while more volatile assets are limited to 35-53% LTV with a ~65% liquidation threshold. Reserve factors, ranging from 10-53% depending on asset risk, maintain a balance between safety and participation opportunities. Phase 1 investors who swapped BTC and ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.01 will see a 3.5x value gain at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. Post-listing projections range between $0.06 and $0.07, justified by the beta launch that will allow users to interact with the platform's full features, increased adoption as more retail investors engage, and the anticipated listings on major exchanges such as Binance. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will continue to create buy pressure, with a portion of revenue from lending and borrowing activities repurchasing MUTM tokens and distributing rewards to mtToken stakers. mtToken staking bonuses in MUTM combined with leaderboard incentives for the Top 50 largest holders will further encourage long-term engagement and drive token demand. CertiK audit credibility reinforces investor confidence, with Manual Review and Static Analysis completed, TokenScan score of 90, and Skynet score of 79. The ongoing $50,000 USDT bug bounty program spans Critical ($2,000), Major ($1,000), Medium ($500), and Low ($200) tiers, ensuring continuous security oversight. Community engagement is strong, with over 12K Twitter followers, and the $100,000 giveaway offers ten winners $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, creating additional excitement around the presale. As retail investors question is crypto a good investment and monitor recent crypto crash events, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides a structured, secure, and highly rewarding alternative to speculative memecoins. With real utility, robust lending mechanisms, upcoming beta access, Layer-2 efficiency, and staking rewards, MUTM is positioned to capture attention from both retail and institutional participants. Phase 6 is already more than half sold, and Phase 7 will raise prices, emphasizing the need for early entry to maximize potential gains. For those seeking a high-compounding ROI, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a DeFi platform designed to combine security, scalability, and growth, offering an opportunity to emulate early BTC-style gains in the DeFi era.

Kremlin warns European leaders against plan it says would steal Russia's money,"MOSCOW - The Kremlin warned European leaders on Wednesday that Russia would pursue any individual or country which stole its money and cautioned that the theft of Russian assets would badly rebound on European depositories and investment. The European Union is mulling a proposal to use Russian assets frozen in Europe to fund a loan of 140 billion euros ($164.37 billion) to Ukraine. There are some $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, 210 billion euros of which is held in Europe, of which 185 billion euros is in Euroclear, a Brussels-based central securities depository; about 176 billion euros of that has become cash as the securities mature. ""We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property. In Russian, we call that simply theft,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said that if anyone stole or misappropriated Russia's assets - or income from those assets - then ""the persons involved will be prosecuted in one way or another, they will all be called to account."" He said any countries involved would also be pursued. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that attempting to take its assets will undermine confidence in the central banking system, in the euro as a currency, and in the perception of the safety of ownership and property rights in Europe. ""These are additional steps towards the complete destruction of trust in the principle of the inviolability of property,"" Peskov said. ""The boomerang will very seriously hit those who are the main depositories, countries that are interested in investment attractiveness,"" he said.

Long Term Crypto Investments 2025: Why BlockchainFX Leads Ahead of Coldware Security and Remittix Cross-Border Utility,"What is the top 100x crypto presale in 2025 that everyone is talking about? The answer right now is BlockchainFX ($BFX) -- a live, revenue-generating trading super app already pulling in millions from eager buyers. Unlike many presales that exist only on paper, BlockchainFX is fully operational, combining crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in one platform. More than 11,800 participants have already invested, raising over $8.5 million before launch. Alongside BlockchainFX, Coldware and Remittix are also making headlines with impressive fundraising. Coldware is nearly sold out of its Stage 3 presale, while Remittix has crossed the $26 million mark by reinventing global payment transfers. Yet, when comparing utility, rewards, and growth potential, BlockchainFX is proving to be the best presale crypto to buy now. 👉 Buy BlockchainFX today with the OCT35 code to claim 35% extra tokens before October 3rd. BlockchainFX has redefined what a presale crypto 2025 project should deliver. The app is already audited by CertiK, fully KYC-compliant, and used by 10,000+ daily traders. Token holders benefit from up to 70% of trading fees redistributed daily in USDT, creating real crypto passive income opportunities. Early adopters are already earning 4-7% per day, with long-term APYs reaching 90%. The presale started at $0.01 and is now priced at $0.026, scheduled to reach $0.05 at launch. A simple investment scenario shows the upside: a $50,000 entry today doubles to $96,000 at launch, and if BFX hits analysts' $1 target, that grows into nearly $2 million. Beyond profits, buyers receive access to BFX Visa cards (Gold, Green, Metal) for real-world spending, plus entry into a $500,000 giveaway.

Remittix (RTX) is transforming how money moves across borders. Its PayFi model lets users send fiat into bank accounts worldwide by simply connecting a crypto wallet. This real-world utility has attracted strong demand, raising $26.7 million with 672 million RTX tokens sold at $0.113 each. Over 71% of tokens are sold, and the next stage will push the price to $0.1166. With a $250k giveaway supporting its promotion, Remittix is gaining traction as one of the best crypto presale projects 2025. While its focus on payments is powerful, it doesn't provide the daily passive income already available to BlockchainFX holders. Coldware is racing toward full sellout with 92% of Stage 3 tokens already purchased. The presale has raised nearly $10 million, with over 1.67 billion tokens sold at $0.008 each. Once the stage closes, the price jumps to $0.00975, making it one of the fastest-moving altcoin undervalued 2025 opportunities. Coldware's focus on secure storage technology has positioned it as a contender in the best crypto presale 2025 list. Still, its long-term potential remains smaller compared to BlockchainFX's global trading super app, which offers multi-asset coverage and ongoing income. The race for the best crypto presale 2025 is heating up. Coldware is nearly sold out, Remittix has crossed $26M raised, but BlockchainFX is leading with real utility, daily rewards, and a confirmed $0.05 launch price. For those asking what the top 100x crypto presale in 2025 is, BlockchainFX stands out as the most promising path to high ROI. Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

I Asked ChatGPT How To Manage Money Like a Billionaire: Here's the Advice,"While you may not have billions in your bank account, many admire those who have achieved billionaire status. From celebrities to CEOs, billionaires all seem to be able to manage their money in an enviable way. We asked ChatGPT how to handle money like a billionaire. Let's explore what it said (and whether it is sound advice). First, the AI assistant advised shifting your mindset from that of a consumer to an investor. A billionaire looks at money as a tool for generating more money, according to ChatGPT. It recommended not merely saving one's income, but instead investing and evaluating purchases on their potential return on investment (ROI). According to Forbes, slightly over 15% of today's billionaires made their money in finance and investing, the wealthiest being the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett. Understanding how to invest and what to invest in is critical for success, which is why it is strongly recommended that any newbie investors speak with a financial advisor first. ChatGPT's second recommendation was to treat your finances like a business. It noted that billionaires frequently either have businesses or manage their assets through holding companies. Treating finances as a business helps to track income, set goals and may have some tax advantages. Again, it is imperative to speak with a financial professional who can help ensure any money moves are in line with personal financial goals and within your risk tolerance. Whether it's a self-promotion or simply a flex, ChatGPT suggested automating and optimizing finances. It casually noted that you should use technology to help. The idea of automating savings is a sound strategy. As CNBC reported, automatically saving even a little each month can help to accumulate wealth by taking advantage of compounding interest. ChatGPT also recommended optimizing savings and investments by using tax-advantaged accounts and refinancing debt when rates are low. Speaking of taxes, the chatbot noted that billionaires pay close attention to them. It suggested not only learning about potential tax deductions and credits, but also investing in tax-efficient vehicles such as Roth IRAs, ETFs and municipal bonds. Finally, it advised hiring a CPA or tax strategist, an opinion with which most experts could agree, particularly when it comes to taxes. ChatGPT advised reading financial books, following the markets and potentially learning a new skill to enhance financial acumen. Many experts agree that even basic financial awareness and understanding are essential for money management. Unfortunately, the U.S. is woefully uneducated when it comes to finances. According to the World Economic Forum, around half of the adults surveyed were financially illiterate. Without fundamental financial literacy, many are unable to make informed decisions about their money, regardless of how much they have in their bank account. Another tip from ChatGPT is to live below your means. The AI-bot noted that many billionaires, including Warren Buffett, live frugally. It said to focus on buying quality instead of quantity, delay gratification for bigger gains and avoid lifestyle creep. Undoubtedly, each of these things can help ensure more money in the bank and less time trying to keep up with the latest trends. Finally, ChatGPT advised that to manage money like a billionaire, one should utilize structures to limit liability and protect wealth, such as obtaining proper insurance, creating an estate plan and establishing an LLC or trust. Down the road, the AI assistant then recommended building a team to help protect any wealth accumulated. Understandably, these tips and tricks may not make you a billionaire overnight, but they should help with good financial decision-making, allowing you to maximize what you have and potentially earn more for the future.",GOBankingRates,2025-10-01T10:21:00Z,https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/wealth/chatgpt-how-manage-money-like-billionaire-advice/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.953235,0.2705882352941176
RBI holds policy rate steady at 5.5% as inflation eases - Cryptopolitan,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its policy rate at 5.5% today. It aligns with forecasts as policymakers assess the impact of previous rate cuts and tax reductions realized amid global trade uncertainty. The decision was unanimous by the Central Bank's six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra revealed that the MPC considered it prudent to maintain the current level, allowing time for the effects of earlier moves to filter through the economy. The RBI had previously reduced the rate by 100 basis points in the first half of 2025. The RBI revealed that the steps are expected to boost domestic demand. The Central Bank of India revised its growth outlook upwards, projecting the GDP will grow by 6.8% from the previous estimate of 6.5%. The country's economy grew by 7.8% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding expectations. The RBI maintained its projections for the 2026 fiscal year at 6.5%, citing concerns about slowing global trade and U.S. tariffs weighing on external demand, despite a currently balanced outlook. The inflation forecast was revised downward, with the Central Bank projecting a Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate of 2.6% for the 2025 fiscal year. The previous estimates placed the CPI for inflation at 3.1%. The RBI also revised down the inflation rate for the 2026 fiscal year from 3.7% to 3.1%. Governor Malhotra revealed that the outlook had turned more harmless due to easing food prices and tax reductions. August Inflation stood at 2.07% close to the lower end of the 2% to 6% tolerance band. While inflation pressures had eased, some economists had expected the RBI to announce further reductions in October. Sonal Varma, Chief economist at Nomura Research, told CNBC that the rate cut in October would have been timely due to the high demand for loans from businesses and households during the festive season. The RBI weighed in on the impact of the recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian exports. The U.S. raised the tariffs on Indian exports to 25%, which increased the total duties to almost 50% on key sectors, including textiles, gems, jewelry, and marine products. Indian exports to the United States account for around 2% of its GDP. The RBI expects the tariff to affect labor-intensive industries, effectively increasing unemployment rates. India took precautionary steps to protect itself from tariff effects by reducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on several consumer products. Reuters reported that the tax cuts on consumer items such as soap, toothpaste, and shampoo were reduced from 18% to 5%. In contrast, the tax on small cars, air conditioners, and other consumer electronics was decreased from 28% to 18%. The tax cuts were aimed at boosting domestic spending to cushion them from U.S. tariffs. The GST Council, which comprises federal and state ministers, simplified the tax structure by reducing it to two slabs from the previous four: 5% and 18%. The tax changes took effect on September 22, and the government is expected to lose up to $5.5 billion as a result. However, luxury goods such as large cars and cigarettes were not included in the tax relief. The GST imposed a 40% duty on high-end luxury goods to boost consumer spending, with companies in the fast-moving consumer goods sector and electronics sector receiving the most benefits. India's benchmark 10-year bond yield has increased by two basis points to 6.6% while the rupee strengthened to 88.75 against the U.S dollar. Equity indexes such as the BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 have also recorded gains over the past month. The BSE Sensex recorded a rise of 0.55% over the past month with a positive YTD of 2.95%. Nifty 50, on the other hand, has recorded a 0.66% rise with a positive YTD of 4.4%. The Indian Central Bank's stance has been considered the main driver for maintaining positive results in India's equity and bond markets amid the tariff hit.",Cryptopolitan,2025-10-01T10:27:49Z,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/rbi-holds-policy-rate-steady-at-5-5-a/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.953864,-0.003921568627450966
Centre Announces 3% DA/DR Hike For Employees And Pensioners; Last Under 7th Pay Commission,"New Delhi: The central government, on Wednesday, announced a 3% hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) ahead of Dussehra and Diwali celebrations. This will impact nearly 49.2 lakh central government employees. Around 68.7 lakh central government pensioners will also see more money entering their bank accounts with the government announcing a 3% hike raise in Dearness Relief or DR. This is the last DA/DR revision under the 7th Central Pay Commission, before the 8th Pay Commission comes into effect from January 2026. Details of the 8th Pay Commission's committee members, terms of reference are yet to be officially notified. DA/DRs undergo revision twice every year to keep salaries and pensions in line with inflation. DA hikes become effective from January 1 and July 1 of the concerned year. Hence, this 3% DA hike will be effective from July 1. This means that employees will receive the revised DA arrears for July, August, September and October. In March this year, the government hiked the DA by 2%, from 53% to 55% of basic pay. With the present 3% hike, the DA is set to become 58% of basic pay. According to ET Wealth Online, an individual with basic pay of Rs 25,600 will see their DA go up from Rs 14,080 to Rs 14,848, translating into a hike of Rs 768 per month. Similarly, someone with a basic salary of Rs 56,900 will see an increase in DA by Rs 1,707. It was estimated that DA would potentially go up to 60% of the basic pay by the end of this year. However, with this 3% hike, the 10-year tenure of the 7th Pay Commission effectively comes to an end and there will be no more DA hikes announced until the 8th Pay Commission comes into effect.",Odisha Bytes,2025-10-01T10:16:24Z,https://odishabytes.com/centre-announces-3-da-dr-hike-for-employees-and-pensioners-last-under-7th-pay-commission/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.954157,0.1764705882352942

MODEC secures contract to deliver FPSO for Hammerhead project,"MODEC has secured the full engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contract to deliver a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for the Hammerhead development. In April, the offshore contractor was granted a limited notice to proceed (LNTP), allowing it to begin designing the FPSO. This step was aimed at facilitating the earliest possible start-up of the project in 2029, pending necessary government approvals. Phase one of the contract, which focused on front-end engineering and design (FEED), has been completed. MODEC stated that it is now progressing to phase two, which involves full EPCI, ensuring execution readiness in accordance with project governance. MODEC Floating Production Solutions Business Unit head Soichi Ide said: ""We are honoured to be entrusted with the full EPCI scope for Hammerhead. This award reflects MODEC's integrated capabilities to design, build and operate - from concept and FEED through to safe execution and timely delivery of the project. ""Building on the strong progress we have made on the Uaru Project, this milestone further underscores the momentum of our collaboration. MODEC's strategic relationship with ExxonMobil Guyana positions us to work with them and our stakeholders to create lasting value throughout the project life cycle."" The FPSO is set to have an initial average production capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd), together with associated gas and produced water handling. It will be moored in around 1,025m of water, leveraging SOFEC's spread mooring system. This will be MODEC's second FPSO assigned to operations in Guyana after the Errea Wittu unit, which is now being built for ExxonMobil Guyana's Uaru development. MODEC will, as it is doing for Uaru, deliver operations and maintenance services for Hammerhead for a ten‑year period, starting from first oil. Last month, ExxonMobil took a final investment decision on the $6.8bn Hammerhead project, the seventh development in Guyana's Stabroek block, following regulatory approvals. The Stabroek block is operated by ExxonMobil Guyana, which holds a 45% interest. Hess Guyana Exploration and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana have 30% and 25% stakes in the block, respectively.",Offshore Technology,2025-10-01T10:22:20Z,https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/modec-fpso-for-hammerhead-project/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.954700,0.3960784313725489

"Budi95 quota renewed today, says Fahmi","PUTRAJAYA: Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil confirmed that the 300-litre quota for recipients of the Budi Madani RON95 (Budi95) subsidy was renewed on Wednesday (Oct 1). The Madani Government spokesman said the matter was in line with the renewal of the Budi95 quota on the first day of every month. ""Today is October 1, so the total quota is returned to 300 litres. Even though recipients bought RON95 using Budi95 on Tuuesday (Sept 30), their quota is back to 300 litres today,"" he said at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Fahmi said the Communications Ministry, the Finance Ministry and petrol station operating companies would issue statements if there was any incorrect information or confusion about the subsidy programme from time to time. He said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim at Wednesday's meeting also directed the Transport Ministry to immediately look into several matters relating to Budi95 including the increase in quotas for e-hailing, p-hailing, taxi and fishing boat drivers. ""On drivers or Malaysians who have a Singapore driving license, there will be a specific mechanism to help them get Budi95 subsidy assistance,"" he said. Fahmi said the Finance Ministry is expected to issue a statement on the latest status of the implementation of Budi95 on Wednesday evening.

FTSE 100 Hits New High Amid Healthcare Surge and U.S. Political Turmoil | Business,"London's FTSE 100 surged to a fresh intraday high on Wednesday, primarily fueled by significant advancements in the healthcare sector. Investors, however, remained cautious as they evaluated the effects of the U.S. government shutdown on key economic reports. The FTSE 100 jumped by 0.7% by 0950 GMT, following a record-breaking close in the previous session, rounding off the third quarter with an approximate 7% gain. Healthcare stocks, with AstraZeneca, Hikma, and GSK at the forefront, outperformed, mirroring gains by their European counterparts. Despite heightened performance in healthcare, global markets showed prudence due to the U.S. government shutdown, affecting federal operations and causing uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's monetary policies. Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 saw a 0.2% decrease, influenced by Tate & Lyle's warning of decreased profits and revenue, with its shares plunging by 9.7%, marking their lowest since 2009.",Devdiscourse,2025-10-01T10:21:41Z,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3648601-ftse-100-hits-new-high-amid-healthcare-surge-and-us-political-turmoil,2025-10-01 18:29:59.955478,0.1529411764705881
Introducing The 1000x Potential Crypto That Delivers Better ROI Than Cardano And Solana,"Imagine stepping into a world where your crypto doesn't just sit in a wallet but actively works for you, offering multiple ways to grow, trade, and spend. For years, investors have looked to altcoins like Cardano and Solana for opportunity, only to find themselves navigating fluctuating prices and limited utility. That's where BlockchainFX (BFX) changes the game. From the moment its presale launched, the platform has been turning heads, surpassing $8.5 million in contributions as it steadily climbs through its tiered pricing structure. The BlockchainFX presale is quickly gaining attention among crypto enthusiasts as one of the best presales to buy now. Designed to reward early investors, the presale features a tiered pricing structure, meaning the token price increases as each fundraising tier is completed. Currently, BFX is priced at $0.026, offering a strong potential gain ahead of its anticipated market launch at $0.05. Adding to the appeal, a time-limited 35% bonus is available using the code OCT35, which runs until 3rd October, providing early buyers with significant value as the presale surpasses $8.5 million and continues to grow. With every tier of the presale bringing BFX closer to its next price level, investors are positioned to benefit from both growth and strategic entry pricing, making it a crypto with high ROI in a market often defined by volatility. BlockchainFX's staking program offers a compelling route for long-term passive income. Participants can stake their BFX tokens and receive a share of trading fees in both BFX and USDT, providing multiple revenue streams for holders. By distributing a portion of the platform's trading fees directly to stakers, BlockchainFX ensures that users are rewarded not just for their investment but for actively supporting the network. This dual-token reward system means that even as the platform grows, those who stake early can enjoy a compounding effect on earnings. For investors looking for sustainable passive income, BlockchainFX's staking model stands out as an attractive, reliable solution. While altcoins like Cardano and Solana have developed vibrant ecosystems, BlockchainFX differentiates itself through a complete multi-asset trading platform. Users can trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, forex, and more within a fully decentralised environment, making it a true super app for digital finance. This diverse digital financial platform enables a seamless user experience across multiple asset classes, providing flexibility and opportunities that most single-focus altcoins cannot match. With BlockchainFX, investors gain access to a broad spectrum of financial instruments and trading options, reinforcing its status as one of the best cryptos to buy today. Adding real-world usability to its ecosystem, BlockchainFX is introducing a presale-exclusive BFX Visa Card, available in Metal or 18 Karat Gold. Cardholders can top up with BFX and over 20 other cryptocurrencies, spend up to $100,000 per transaction, and withdraw up to $10,000 monthly from ATMs. The card also allows payments using BFX and USDT rewards and is accepted worldwide for both online and in-store transactions. This integration highlights BlockchainFX's commitment to blending digital and traditional finance, positioning the platform as more than just another altcoin but a complete solution for crypto investors seeking utility and convenience. Why BlockchainFX Stands Out in Today's Market Compared to altcoins such as Cardano and Solana, which occasionally face network congestion or require waiting periods for staking rewards, BlockchainFX offers an ecosystem designed for speed, flexibility, and tangible benefits for its community. Its presale structure, staking model, multi-asset trading platform, and presale-exclusive Visa Card create a unique proposition for investors seeking the best crypto price predictions and long-term growth potential. For those seeking a crypto with high ROI and comprehensive utility, BlockchainFX presents a compelling alternative and a chance to get in early on one of the best cryptos to buy.

Crypto Calculator Breaks: Tundra Presale Returns Too Massive to Compute - Cryptopolitan,"Crypto analysts often rely on ROI calculators to illustrate potential gains, plugging in current prices, bonuses, and target valuations. For XRP Tundra, however, the math stretches conventional expectations. The Phase 4 presale is structured so that even modest allocations translate into outsized outcomes -- returns so steep they challenge the utility of traditional forecasting tools. The reason lies not in hype but in the project's architecture. A dual-token system, transparent launch pricing, staking utilities, and engineered liquidity combine into a model where exponential upside is built directly into the economics. Early buyers are discovering that Tundra's design produces results that conventional calculators can barely capture. At the current stage, TUNDRA-S is priced at $0.068. Each purchase comes with a 16% token bonus, and buyers also receive TUNDRA-X free of charge, referenced at $0.034. Launch prices are fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X. This means a relatively small allocation today converts into multiples rarely seen in established assets. Unlike speculative forecasts that depend on uncertain market cycles, the pathway here is transparent. Defined launch values allow investors to calculate upside in advance, and the numbers reveal returns that overwhelm typical crypto benchmarks. Presale multiples are only part of the story. XRP Tundra also introduces Cryo Vault staking, where holders can lock tokens and earn up to 30% APY. Frost Keys, NFT-based utilities, enhance this system by boosting yields or shortening lock durations. Although staking has not yet launched, presale participants secure guaranteed access once vaults open. This transforms tokens from speculative chips into yield-bearing assets, ensuring that investors benefit even if broader market conditions shift. The risk with presale multiples is always the same: volatility at launch can wipe them away. XRP Tundra has built in protections to counter that outcome through Meteora's DAMM V2 liquidity pools. These pools introduce dynamic fees that start high, deterring bots and immediate dumping, and then ease gradually to allow organic trading. Liquidity positions are represented as NFTs, while permanent lock features guarantee a stable baseline of tradability. For investors, this means that extraordinary presale gains are not undermined the moment trading begins. Instead, the architecture itself helps preserve value through the most turbulent phases of price discovery. Confidence in presales depends on verification, and XRP Tundra has taken steps that few new projects attempt. Its contracts and tokenomics have been reviewed by Cyberscope, Solidproof, and Freshcoins. Team identity is confirmed via Vital Block KYC. External coverage has also begun amplifying its reach. In a recent video, Crypto League highlighted how Tundra's dual-token model and launch safeguards differentiate it from conventional presales, framing it as one of the most distinctive opportunities of the cycle. Crypto calculators can model Bitcoin doubling or Solana tripling, but they struggle to capture the kind of growth baked into XRP Tundra's presale. With dual tokens, staking yields, and liquidity protections, returns are not just hypothetical but structured into the economics from day one. As Phase 4 advances, the presale is redefining expectations of what ""early entry"" means in digital assets. For participants, the question is no longer whether gains are possible but how large they can become -- and the numbers already suggest outcomes that standard models cannot compute.",Cryptopolitan,2025-10-01T10:27:49Z,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-calculator-breaks-tundra-presale-returns-too-massive-to-compute/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.956591,0.1607843137254903
Gold price hits new record high as US enters first government shutdown in seven years,"Gold (GC=F) prices ticked higher on Wednesday, with haven assets looking more attractive as the US government entered its first lockdown in seven years. The precious metal was trading at all-time highs on the continued political uncertainty. On Tuesday, Senate votes failed to advance either a Republican bill (even as three members of the Democratic caucus crossed party lines to vote 'yes') or a Democratic plan. No compromise plan was offered, ensuring the funding lapse. Non-essential government departments will cease to function and officials will be put on unpaid leave while the shutdown commences. The shutdown -- the first since a seven-week stoppage during Trump's first term -- began at 12:01am ET as the new fiscal year began. That last shutdown took place in 2018 and broke the record for the longest in American history. Economic effects might be noticeable quickly as government spending largely ceases and economic data gets delayed, starting this Friday with what was scheduled to be a jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These impacts could be mitigated if the stoppage ends promptly. Gold (GC=F) futures jumped 1.1% in early trade in London following a day of profit taking. Over the past five sessions the yellow metal has rallied nearly 5%, and is now changing hands at $3,916.50 per troy ounce. Spot gold prices also advanced 1.1% to the $3,886 mark. Oil prices pulled lower again on Wednesday, compounding the week's losses as traders continue to fret about the potential of oversupply and the next moves by Opec+. Reports by multiple news outlets earlier in the week said that Opec+ is considering hiking output by more than previously thought in October. But the bloc denied this in a post on X. The cartel wrote that media reports of plans to raise output by 500,000 barrels per day were misleading. Traders are also worried about the resumption of Kurdish oil exports. Brent crude futures (BZ=F) dipped around 0.9%, to $65.47 a barrel. For the year to date, crude prices are now 12% lower. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) fell 0.9% to trade at $61.80 per barrel. Year-to-date, WTI prices are nearly 13% lower. The pound made gains against the euro and dollar (GBPUSD=X) on Wednesday morning, rallying towards the $1.35 mark as traders assess the political uncertainty in the US. Sterling moved 0.2% higher against the dollar alongside London-listed stocks, with the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gracing new all-time highs.

No one to blame for price adjustments - DPP Malawi 24 | Latest News from Malawi,"The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has asked Malawians not to attribute the recent increase in fuel and Castel beer product prices to the incoming administration or the outgoing administration led by Lazarus Chakwera. According to DPP secretary general Peter Mukhito, these price adjustments are decisions made by standalone entities operating independently influenced by global economic factors beyond the control of any political party or government. Mukhito further says the party respects the autonomy of such entities and has no intention to influence their commercial decisions. ""We underscore that these adjustments are influenced by global economic factors beyond the control of any Malawian government or political party. DPP does not control the global economy, and prices of commodities like fuel are subject to international market dynamics,"" reads the letter. The party has since urged Malawians not to attribute the increase in Prices of these products to their leader, Arthur Peter Mutharika, who is yet to take the oath of office on 04th October 2025. On the other hand, Mukhitho has pointed to positive economic indicators of maize price drop and foreign exchange as well as assuring Malawians that the price of commodities will normalise when DPP assumes office.

"Temasek boosts bets on public stocks, pursues 'active alpha'","[SINGAPORE] Temasek Holdings has invested more into public equities in the last 18 months than it traditionally has done, according to chief executive officer Dilhan Pillay. The state-owned investor, which managed assets with a net portfolio value of S$434 billion as of Mar 31, has created an ""active alpha"" relative return strategy, Pillay said at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore on Wednesday (Oct 1). ""It's a bit of an aberration for us, because we're generally absolute return,"" he said. ""But we did that in order to build up the muscle that we need to have, to be able to get the best out of our public market investing, and that includes conversion of private into public."" Under Pillay, who has been CEO of the holding company since 2021 and has led the operational arm for longer, the firm increased its investments in private markets in an effort to generate better long-term returns. But such deals can be opaque and illiquid, and part of the push has coincided with a sharp downturn on the amount of cash that investors can extract from their supposedly profitable portfolios. ""Private companies are staying private for longer,"" he said. In its last fiscal year, Temasek made divestments worth S$42 billion - the biggest annual sum on record - while the percentage of its assets in private assets fell below its public holdings for the first time in four years. The firm reported a 10-year total shareholder return of 5 per cent, a compounded and annualised measure that includes dividends. That fell short of the MSCI World Index of global stocks, which returned an annualised 10 per cent in the decade through March 2025. Temasek recently said it would rearrange its portfolio from Apr 1 to sharpen its investment focus. It will create three new entities that would focus on its direct investments in global companies, its Singapore-based portfolio companies, and on managing the allocation of capital to invest in funds.

Myanmar's food crisis and growing hunger in Rakhine state,"YANGON: Hunger is rising in Myanmar, the impoverished Southeast Asian country that has been ravaged by conflict since a 2021 military coup ousted an elected civilian government. Some 3.6 million people are displaced across the war-torn nation, according to the United Nations, and a lack of funding has left millions of vulnerable people without life-saving humanitarian support. Myanmar is one of the world's most underfunded aid operations, with only 12% of required funds received, the UN says. WHAT IS THE HUNGER SITUATION NATIONWIDE? More than 16 million people across Myanmar, about a third of the population, are acutely food insecure, meaning that their lack of food threatens lives and livelihoods, according to the World Food Programme. They are the fifth-largest group needing aid anywhere in the world, making Myanmar ""a hunger hotspot of very high concern,"" the agency said. More than 540,000 children across the country are expected to suffer this year from acute malnutrition - life-threatening wasting that can have severe and lifelong effects - a 26% increase from last year, WFP said. One in three children under the age of five is already suffering from stunted growth, according to WFP. HOW BAD IS IT IN RAKHINE? The western coastal state of Rakhine, where conflict is raging, has been hit particularly hard by the food crisis, with restrictions on aid delivery and the movement of people. In central Rakhine, the WFP estimates that 57% of families cannot afford basic food, up from 33% in December 2024, while the situation in the hard-to-reach north is probably even worse, it says. Food prices are as much as four times higher than before the conflict, while many markets are empty and people are unable to travel freely or find jobs to support themselves, according to a WFP official. The crisis is driving more Rohingya families from Rakhine into Bangladesh, where more than 1 million members of the Muslim minority group already live in crowded refugee camps after a brutal Myanmar military crackdown in 2017 triggered a mass exodus. Many newly arrived Rohingya refugees are suffering from acute malnutrition, especially children and pregnant and lactating women, the International Rescue Committee says. Hospital admissions for severe wasting increased by 12% between January and June this year compared to the same period in 2024, and Unicef treated 1,028 severely wasted children among new arrivals between October 2024 and June 2025, it said. - Reuters",The Star ,2025-10-01T10:27:21Z,https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/10/01/myanmar039s-food-crisis-and-growing-hunger-in-rakhine-state,2025-10-01 18:29:59.957987,-0.4431372549019608
"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university.

"Dimitra and National Coffee Cooperative Union Partner to Advance a National Initiative on Environmental Compliance, Carbon, and ESG in Kenya","Dimitra and National Coffee Cooperative Union Partner to Advance a National Initiative on Environmental Compliance, Carbon, and ESG in Kenya The collaboration leverages Dimitra's Connected Coffee platform and Protocols, together with NACCU's network of over 1 million farmers, to deliver nationwide EUDR, Carbon, and ESG compliance NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Dimitra, a global leader in agricultural technology and sustainability solutions, has announced a strategic partnership with National Coffee Cooperative Union (NACCU), a Kenyan umbrella body and national coffee cooperative union, representing over a million smallholder farmers across Kenya. Together, they are launching a nationwide system that integrates environmental compliance assessment, carbon accounting, and ESG practices across Kenya's coffee value chain, supporting access to premium markets such as the European Union, where EUDR compliance is increasingly required. Expected to come into effect on December 31, 2025, EUDR is set to reshape the landscape of global agricultural exports and require all coffee exports, among other commodities entering the European Union (EU) to be deforestation-free and fully traceable. Compliance involves providing GPS coordinates, forest cover data, and legal documentation for each plot of land where coffee is grown. With the EU accounting for over 50% of Kenya's coffee exports, the pressure from European buyers is already clear: they increasingly demand evidence of EUDR compliance as a condition for purchase. As a result, non-compliance poses a significant risk to the country's coffee sector. For smallholder farmers, many of whom lack access to digital tools and compliance systems, meeting these requirements poses a major challenge. Dimitra and NACCU's joint initiative aims to close this gap in a timely manner. Leveraging Dimitra's state-of-the-art AI-driven AgTech solutions, including its Connected Coffee application, the 1+ million farmers across NACCU's associated unions will be empowered to register their farms, digitally map their land with geolocation data, complete deforestation risk surveys, and generate EUDR-aligned compliance reports. The application will also provide registered farmers with mobile-based onboarding and technical support, ensuring access in key coffee-producing areas including Meru, Kipkelion, Kiambu, Nyeri, and Mt. Elgon. This agreement was formally signed during a meeting on Friday, September 26, with the participation of NACCU's Board of Directors and several Unions. The active involvement of the Unions demonstrates the strong interest and commitment of local actors, while NACCU provides strategic support at the national level, showing that Kenya Farmers continue with a strong focus on compliance and sustainability across the sector. Jon Trask , CEO of Dimitra, expressed delight at the partnership's potential: ""EUDR will completely reshape the global coffee trade for the better, and Kenya is stepping up to meet the challenge. This partnership with NACCU not only prepares farmers and cooperatives for compliance with European environmental standards, it also advances Kenya's broader goals of aligning agricultural exports with international sustainability frameworks, expanding opportunities in carbon and ESG markets, strengthening local livelihoods, and safeguarding access to high-value markets.. Dimitra is excited to help support Kenyan coffee competitiveness and sustainability efforts while encouraging and facilitating EUDR compliance."" Farmer inclusion is of paramount importance, and through this partnership, Dimitra and NACCU aim to bring immediate impact. Onboarding farmers through offline-capable mobile apps, which are available in English and Swahili, the initiative ensures that even the most remote producers can participate and benefit from these global market opportunities. Mr. Festus Bett , CEO of NACCU, said: ""In a time when digital exclusion threatens to widen inequality in global trade, this partnership demonstrates that with the right technology and grassroots coordination, it is possible to bring millions of smallholder farmers into global compliance and build a more compliant coffee value chain. By empowering Kenya's coffee farmers with the right tools and training needed to comply with the EU's Deforestation Regulation, we are not only securing their access to a key export market but also reinforcing our commitment towards building more sustainable and transparent agricultural value chains. Partnering with Dimitra empowers us to bring this vision to life across our vast network."" Jon Trask, CEO of Dimitra, and Mr. Festus Bett, CEO of NACCU, are available for an interview on request. About Dimitra Dimitra is a global Agtech company with a mission to help smallholder farmers across the world. Dimitra works with key agricultural parties and decision makers including government agencies, NGOs, cooperatives, agriculture supply chain parties like exporters, suppliers, operators, and for-profit organizations.

About NACCU NACCU is a national cooperative organization. Its membership consists of all registered secondary coffee cooperative unions in Kenya. The mandate of NACCU is to advocate for the welfare, policy and trade of small-scale coffee farmers across all levels of the coffee value chain.

South Africa: Land reform for tourism and conservation,"With the total contribution of travel and tourism to the economy is projected at about R659bn, equivalent to 8.9% of the national GDP, Vumelana Advisory Fund chief executive, Peter Setou, believes that land reform should not be confined to agricultural activity, but expanded to non-agricultural uses such as conservation and tourism. Barokologadi - ERP Melorane Game Reserve Partnership is an example of beneficiary communities forging strategic partnerships with private investors that have enabled them to put their land to effective economic use in the tourism industry (Image supplied) Vumelana Advisory Fund is a non-profit organisation that helps land reform beneficiaries put their land to productive use. Setou points out that discussions about the land reform programme have disproportionately focused on how productive the beneficiaries have managed to effectively use the land for agricultural purposes, without considering the suitability of the land for non-agrarian activities. Opportunities While South Africa has an expansive land surface, Setou cites data from the National Treasury, which indicates that only a fraction of this land is arable and suitable for agricultural activities. Furthermore, unfavourable climatic and soil conditions leave only 12% of the country suitable for the production of rain-fed crops, with only 3% considered genuinely fertile land. According to the National Treasury, South Africa's total land area is approximately 122.3 million hectares, of which farmland makes up 100.6 million hectares. Of this, 83.3% is grazing land, with only 16.7 million hectares considered potentially arable land according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Setou says this creates opportunities for beneficiaries of the land reform programme to consider opportunities in non-agricultural ventures such as conservation and the tourism sector. ""This allows them to leverage the country's unparalleled diverse ecosystem to offer a variety of experiences, from adventure tourism, wildlife safaris and natural scenic wonders to conservation of unique flora and fauna and cultural heritage,"" says Setou. Travel and tourism impact The latest economic impact research by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) indicates that the total contribution of travel and tourism to the economy is projected at about R659bn, equivalent to 8.9% of the national GDP. The sector has one of the highest job absorption rates and is forecast to support approximately 1.9 million jobs in 2025, up from 1.8 million people in 2024, according to the WTTC. Setou says the initiatives that the Department of Tourism is undertaking to boost tourism, such as improving the visa regime and increasing the number of direct flights to South Africa, are beginning to bear fruit, as indicated by the surge in the number of visitors from the countries affected by these policy changes. Thus successful implementation of the land reform programme has the potential to accelerate the growth of the tourism sector by deflating simmering fears of wanton land grabs and encouraging nervous investors to plough much-needed capital into tourism-related projects. ""Through strategic collaborations between the beneficiary communities and private investors,"" Setou says, ""beneficiary communities can play a meaningful role in the tourism sector and ensure that they become part of the tourism growth story in South Africa. Partnership models Vumelana Advisory Fund has successfully facilitated landmark transactions that have enabled beneficiary communities to forge strategic partnerships with private investors, enabling them to put their land to effective economic use in the tourism industry. Some of the partnerships the organisation has been instrumental in forging are the Barokologadi - ERP Melorane Game Reserve Partnership, which resulted in the conclusion of two partnership agreements with Elephants, Rhinos & People (ERP) in 2015 and 2016 for the development of tourism lodges on the land adjacent to Madikwe Game Reserve. Another one is Mkambati Nature Reserve - Gwegwe Camp Tourism Partnership, which is a lease-based partnership agreement that provides for the developer to lease a portion of the reserve and develop a 110-bed lodge and 10 villas at two beach locations in the Eastern Cape at a cost of more than R65m. At the end of the lease period, the ownership of the lodge will revert to the community trust. ""The successful partnership models reinforce our conviction that the success of the land reform programme in South Africa hinges on close collaboration between beneficiary communities and private investors,"" says Setou. Whilst there are challenges in the implementation of land reform, it is important to share success stories and lessons that key stakeholders can learn from. This will go a long way to ensure that past mistakes are not repeated. A meeting of minds The land reform programme presents synergies that should be explored, where the claimant communities have the land assets, and the private investors have the required capital, expertise as well as access to markets. ""A meeting of minds between these two entities is the sweet spot we should be striving to hit. ""This, however, requires independent facilitation, and organisations like Vumelana should be supported so that they can provide this important service, adds Setou. All rights reserved. © 2022.

"Samsung, SK Hynix to supply memory chips to OpenAI's Stargate project","SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers, they said on Wednesday, as South Korean chipmakers join forces with the ChatGPT maker to meet rising demand from its Stargate project. The announcements were made on Wednesday after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and the chairmen of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix at the presidential office in central Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the $500 billion Stargate project in January, charging OpenAI and partners including SoftBank and Oracle with ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in artificial intelligence. Expanding chip availability was one of the key ideas of the project, and Nvidia said last week it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips. FIRMS SEEN SUPPLYING MUCH OF OPENAI'S STARGATE CHIP DEMAND South Korea's presidential office said OpenAI's chip demand for Stargate was expected to reach 900,000 wafers a month, and OpenAI hoped to source much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix. It added that the supply timeline had not yet been decided. The office said the partnership gave South Korean chipmakers an early foothold in the world's largest AI infrastructure project, providing a growth opportunity for the domestic chip industry. Samsung and SK Hynix together hold about 70% of the global Dynamic Random Access Memory chip market and nearly 80% of the HBM market. HBM - a type of DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications. OpenAI this year set up its first office in Seoul as South Korean demand for its ChatGPT service surged. The country has the largest number of paying ChatGPT rs after the United States, according to OpenAI. (Reporting by Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin.

Max URB_N Shuffles It Up with Spotify: India's First Multi-City Rap Concert Series Takes Over the South | Business Upturn,"Three cities. Three weekends. One generation unmuted. What started as a beat dropped on the streets exploded into a cultural takeover as Max URB_N and Spotify joined forces for India's first fashion-led rap concert series -- the Max URB_N Unmute: South Tour. From Kochi to Hyderabad to Chennai, the South didn't just hear rap, it lived it. The lineup was fire -- Baby Jean, Kayden Sharma, and Chennai's very own Paal Dabba -- artists who've already carved their place in India's rap soundscape with over 45.2 lakh monthly Spotify listeners. But their live sets hit different. Crowds packed in by the thousands, spitting verses back word for word, proving that South Indian hip-hop isn't rising anymore -- it has arrived. Adding to the heat was an exclusive anthem created for the tour, blending local rhythms, street slang, and fearless self-expression into an instant generational banger. The South Tour wasn't just about the music. It blurred lines between stage and street, with immersive Max URB_N pop-ups and interactive fan moments turning every stop into a cultural playground. For three weekends, fashion, music, and identity collided in the loudest way possible. ""With Max URB_N, our ambition has always been to be part of youth culture in its truest form,"" said Sumit Chandna, Deputy CEO, Max Fashion. ""Rap gives us that bridge: it's authentic, it's unapologetic, and it's local. With the South Tour featuring Paal Dabba, Baby Jean, and Kayden Sharma, we're not just putting on a show; we're building a stage where young India can see themselves -- loud, proud, and unmuted."" Sumit added, ""We're shaping a new cultural space where fashion and music collide. From launching an original rap anthem to collaborating with Alaya F on IYKYDK -- a Gen Z narrative -- the brand has been steadily setting a new benchmark every season. Now, by taking it to the next level with a multi-city rap tour showcasing the most authentic voices in hip hop, we are creating a cultural moment that puts URB_N at the heart of youth identity, where style and sound meet."" Arjun Ravi Kolady, Head of Sales - Spotify India, said: ""Spotify has long championed local hip-hop and emerging voices. This isn't new for us -- it's part of our DNA. Partnering with Max URB_N for the South Tour takes that commitment further, creating an intersection of sound and style that resonates deeply with Gen Z. Gabhri, MC Hari, and Vengayo embody the raw energy of the South, and this platform ensures their stories travel louder, prouder, and further than ever before.""

Singapore shares rise amid mixed regional showing; STI up 0.5%,"[SINGAPORE] Singapore stocks continued to climb on Wednesday (Oct 1), amid a mixed showing from regional bourses. The blue-chip Straits Times Index (STI) closed 22.96 points or 0.5 per cent up at 4,323.12, marking the third consecutive day of gains. Across the broader market, gainers beat decliners 258 to 155, with 1.6 billion securities worth S$1.6 billion in total transacted. LHN shares finished at S$0.95, up 2.2 per cent or S$0.02, after the property management group said its co-living business Coliwoo had lodged a preliminary prospectus for a Singapore Exchange (SGX) mainboard listing. The unit's portfolio comprises 25 properties across the city-state; of these, 11 are owned by the group, 10 are leased, and four are managed by the group. Meanwhile, shares of Thakral Corporation rose 2.5 per cent or S$0.04 to S$1.65, just shy of its 52-week high of S$1.66. The rally followed the company's announcement that it had divested Yotsubashi Nakano Building, a commercial property in Japan, for 5.3 billion yen (S$46.2 million). The sale unlocked around S$6.4 million in cash flow and led to a one-off attributable profit of about S$2 million. Addvalue Technologies was the most actively traded stock on Wednesday, after it announced before market open that it was on track to meeting criteria for exiting the SGX watch list. It gained 14.3 per cent or S$0.005 to end at S$0.04, with 120.5 million shares transacted. The technology company has been on the watch list since December 2023. It had clocked three years of pre-tax losses, but said it had managed to eke out a US$2 million net profit for its FY2025 ended June. On the STI, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding declined 2.7 per cent or S$0.09 to S$3.28, making the China-based shipbuilder the worst performer on the blue-chip barometer. Seatrium was the top STI performer. Shares of the engineering solutions provider logged a 2.1 per cent or S$0.05 rise to finish at S$2.42. The three local banks closed with their shares up as well. OCBC rose 0.4 per cent or S$0.07 to S$16.51, UOB added 0.3 per cent or S$0.01 to close at S$34.68, and DBS climbed 0.8 per cent or S$0.43 to S$51.58. Elsewhere in the region, key indices were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 per cent and Australia's ASX 200 slipped 0.04 per cent, while the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index gained 0.6 per cent.

Noodle maker Leong Guan lodges preliminary document for IPO on SGX Catalist board,"[SINGAPORE] Food manufacturing and distribution company Leong Guan on Tuesday (Sep 30) lodged its preliminary document for a listing on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange (SGX). The company has more than 22 years of experience in the food industry and specialises in manufacturing fresh noodle and soya bean-based beancurd products, according to its preliminary document. It also trades a wide range of food-related products and supplies food products to around 2,000 customers in local and overseas markets. Its local customers include brick and mortar retailers such as supermarkets and minimarts, alongside e-commerce platforms including Shopee, FairPrice Online, Grab and foodpanda, and its own platform The Picky Grocer. The placement will comprise new shares and vendor shares, which will be available to retail and institutional investors in Singapore, the preliminary document said. Net proceeds from the placement may be used to expand the company's export markets and product range, and enhance its manufacturing facilities. They may also be used for acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances to expand the business and for general working capital needs. While the company does not have a fixed dividend policy, its board intends to recommend and distribute dividends of at least 80 per cent of its net profit for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2025, and of no less than 35 per cent of its net profit for the financial year ending December 2026. Based on its unaudited financial statements, its profit before tax for the first three months of 2025 ended March fell 49.9 per cent to around S$221,000 from S$441,000 in the year-ago period. However, its revenue for the period grew 3 per cent on the year to S$9.4 million, from S$9.1 million, which the company attributed to higher demand. The fall in the bottom line came as the group's finance costs rose 107.6 per cent to S$62,000 for the three months, from S$30,000 previously. It also recorded around S$40,000 in net impairment losses for the period, but recorded no such losses in the previous corresponding three months. In terms of future plans, Leong Guan intends to expand its overseas customer base by growing its exports to distributors and brand owners, and increasing its presence across Asia, Australia, North America, the Middle East and Europe. It intends to obtain food import certifications necessary for growth in these markets and is seeking internationally recognised certifications, such as the FSSC 22000, which recognises robust and effective food safety management systems. It also plans to enhance its food offerings by broadening its product range through a vertical expansion strategy, by offering products tailored to its customers' preferences and lifestyles. This includes developing ready-to-eat meals, widening the range of flavours and recipes in its offerings and developing snacks that may yield higher margins than its existing products. Its plans also include developing foods catered to customers' health requirements or the needs of different age groups, as well as partnering nutritionists, chefs or other food professionals to create products, such as reduced-carbohydrate ramen or low glycaemic index foods, that are healthy and appealing to customers.",The Business Times,2025-10-01T05:22:17Z,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/noodle-maker-leong-guan-lodges-preliminary-document-ipo-sgx-catalist-board,2025-10-01 18:29:59.964222,0.2470588235294118
"Rupee logs best day in two weeks as dollar droops, RBI holds rates","MUMBAI, October 1 (Reuters) -The Indian rupee nudged higher on Wednesday in a modest advance that was still enough to notch its best day in two weeks after the Reserve Bank of India kept policy rates unchanged and the dollar slipped broadly as the U.S. government shut down. The rupee closed at 88.69 against the U.S. dollar, up 0.1% on the day, the most since September 17. The rupee hasn't gained in nine out of the last 10 sessions. Meanwhile the dollar slipped to a one-week low against major peers. Though the rupee appeared on course to open below its all-time low of 88.80 early in the session, likely intervention by the central bank helped limit the pressure on the currency, traders said. State-run banks were spotted offering dollars consistently early in the session, most likely on behalf of the RBI, a trader at a large private bank said. The central bank kept its policy rate unchanged on Wednesday, signalling room to lower rates in December as it assesses the impact of domestic tax cuts and punitive U.S. tariffs on the South Asian economy. ""We see a gradual depreciation of the INR over the medium term as an appropriate response to external demand risks,"" analysts at ANZ said in a note. Current projections indicate the possibility of another rate cut in December 2025, the note added. India's benchmark equity indexes, the BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 ended higher by 0.9% each, led by gains in banking stocks after the central bank unveiled a raft of measures to boost bank lending to capital markets and large corporates. The central bank also announced measures to boost the rupee's international usage. Meanwhile, the dollar index was down 0.2% at 97.6 after dipping to a one-week low earlier as a U.S. government shutdown unsettled markets and risked delaying data seen key to gauge the future path of Fed policy rates. Asian currencies were flat to slightly higher.",Yahoo News,2025-10-01T10:13:11Z,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/rupee-logs-best-day-two-101311353.html,2025-10-01 18:29:59.964475,-0.08235294117647063
"South Africa: Mixed bag as petrol increases slightly, diesel on the downturn","South Africans will face a mixed bag at the pumps following the announcement of the petrol price adjustments by the Department of Mineral and Petroleum Resources (DMPR) today, 30 September. The department announced marginal increases to the price of both grades of petrol, with diesel variants set for a price drop. Decreases will also be felt for consumers of illuminating paraffin and LP Gas. The following price adjustments will apply: - Petrol 93 (ULP and LRP): 1c increase. - Petrol 95 (ULP and LRP): 8c increase. - Diesel (0.05% sulphur): 10c decrease. - Diesel (0.005% sulphur): 8c decrease. - Illuminating Paraffin (wholesale): 11c decrease. - Single Maximum National Retail Price for Illuminating Paraffin: 15c decrease. - Maximum Retail Price of LP Gas: 17c decrease and 19c decrease in the Western Cape. ""The average Brent Crude oil price increased slightly from $67.01 to $67.16 during the period under review. The increase in the price of crude oil is due to the geopolitical risks emanating from the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the Middle East conflict. ""The impact of the geopolitical risks outweighs the OPEC+ recent announcement to increase production in October, which could ultimately lead to increased supply and lower prices,"" the department said. Furthermore, international petroleum prices ""followed the increasing trend of crude oil prices"". The rand also strengthened during the period under review. ""This led to higher contributions to the Basic Fuel Prices [BFP] of petrol by 16.93 cents per litre (c/l), diesel by 8.13c/l and illuminating paraffin by 4.23c/l. The prices of Propane and Butane remained the same as during the previous period; however, the shipping costs were lower. ""The Rand appreciated on average, against the USD... from R17.73 to R17.49 per USD during the period under review when compared to the previous one. This led to lower contributions to the Basic Fuel Prices of petrol by 14.27c/l, diesel by 15.40c/l and Illuminating paraffin by 14.79c/l,"" the DMPR said. All rights reserved. © 2022.

Eskom has reported a profit for the financial year 2025, marking the first time in eight years. However, its financial statements remain qualified due to material uncertainties regarding its going concern status, among other factors.

"Big rise in drug offences, while car thefts double  - News - Carlow Nationalist","""IN some parts of Carlow, people will tell you drugs are as easy to get as a takeaway. That level of access shows just how normalised they've become - and that has to change."" That was the stark warning from cllr Daniel Pender, cathaoirleach of Muinebheag Municipal District, following the release of new crime figures that show a sharp rise in drug and road offences across the Carlow/Kilkenny region. There was a 27% increase in drug offences in the last six months, with a 58% rise in drink- and drug-driving offences. Car thefts almost doubled in the same period. The CSO figures highlight just how stark the shifts have been in just six months. Controlled drug offences rose from 184 incidents to 233, an increase of 27%, while cases of possession for personal use jumped from 128 to 164, up 28%. Drink- and drug-driving offences showed one of the steepest rises, climbing by 58% from 72 to 114, and vehicle theft almost doubled, rising from 42 to 75 incidents. By contrast, burglary and related offences fell sharply, down 31% from 166 to 114, while assaults causing harm also declined, dropping from 83 to 68. Weapons and explosives offences recorded a fall from 39 to 28. However, not all categories improved. Incidents of arson nearly doubled from 14 to 26, and cases of criminal damage and environmental offences rose from 214 to 248, a 16% increase. The information, published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), compares the second half of 2024 with the first half of 2025. The statistics reveal a surge in controlled drug offences, possession for personal use, and drink and drug-driving - trends that local politicians say mirror what communities are seeing on the ground. Cllr Pender (FF) said the spike in road-related offences was one of the most concerning aspects of the figures. ""This is deeply worrying. These crimes endanger innocent lives. They are reckless and selfish choices. The message has to be crystal clear: don't drink and drive, and don't take drugs. Full stop."" He argued that enforcement needed to be coupled with health-based interventions, pointing to international models where firm penalties are balanced with immediate access to treatment. He continued: ""Sweden shows how this can work. They combine firm enforcement with immediate access to treatment and rehabilitation. People who are caught face consequences, but they also get structured support to overcome addiction. That reduces reoffending, helps people turn their lives around, and ultimately makes communities safer."" Cllr Adrienne Wallace (PBP) said she shared residents' concerns about the rise in drug and driving offences and argued that prevention must be central to tackling the issue. She suggested that part of the solution could lie in transport policy as well as enforcement. ""Perhaps we need to examine where in the county these offences occur the most. If it is in rural Carlow, then we should be examining free, late-night links to safely accommodate people out at night. ""The stick approach only works so far; many don't think they will get caught or hurt, so it's obviously not enough of a deterrent. We should find alternatives to ensure it stops,"" she added. Mayor of Carlow Paul Doogue (FG) said the rising figures reflected gardaí becoming more active and visible in local communities. ""The recordings of higher statistics are because the gardaí are more active in the community and more fines are being handed out, people are not getting away with as much as before."" But he warned that policing alone was not enough. He called for more garda recruitment nationwide, tougher sentencing, and a stronger focus on education for young people. ""People in my opinion are getting away too easily after being caught; handed down a suspended sentence, then they go out and reoffend."" Independent councillor Will Paton expressed surprise that drink-driving offences had risen, but said he was not shocked by the increase in drug-driving. And he was sharply critical of garda resourcing in Co Carlow. ""We see that garda resources have been increased in areas like Dublin city centre, which is fine for Dublin city centre, but that comes at a cost, in my opinion, to local towns and villages. In Tullow, in particular, resources are stretched too thin."" Cllr Paton also questioned the effectiveness of the justice system, pointing to repeat offenders. ""There are far too many people wandering the streets who have been convicted 50, 60, 70, 80 times and don't seem to get the message. In fact, the message they are getting is that no matter what you do, there's a revolving door, and unless you literally commit murder, you're not going to get sentenced to prison. ""There's the saying 'do the crime, do the time'; now it's more like 'do the crime, face no time'. Back in the 1850s, you would've been hung for stealing a sheep!""",Carlow Nationalist,2025-10-01T10:27:12Z,https://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/news/big-rise-in-drug-offences-while-car-thefts-double_arid-72630.html,2025-10-01 18:29:59.965511,-0.2235294117647059

Cal-Maine Foods enters fiscal 2026 from a position of strength and is a uniquely attractive combination of both value and growth in today's food sector,"" said Sherman Miller, president and chief executive officer of Cal-Maine Foods. Quarterly Results Overview Net sales were $922.6 million, compared to $785.9 million, up 17.4%. Total shell egg sales increased 6.5% on 2.5% higher sales volume and 3.9% higher selling prices. Shell egg sales represented 85.6% of total net sales as the company diversified its sales towards prepared foods. The acquisition of Echo Lake Foods added $70.5 million to net sales. Conventional egg sales grew 4.4%, primarily due to 4.7% higher conventional egg selling prices. Conventional egg sales volume was relatively flat. Specialty egg sales improved 10.4%, primarily due to a 7.5% increase in specialty egg sales volume and 2.6% higher specialty egg selling prices. Specialty eggs drove a greater portion of shell egg sales, accounting for 35.9% of total shell egg sales, a 130-basis point increase, reflecting ongoing mix shift. Gross profit was $311.3 million, compared to $247.2 million, up 25.9%, primarily driven by 3.9% higher shell egg selling prices, 7.5% growth in specialty egg sales volume, 4.3% lower feed costs, and contributions from the Echo Lake Foods acquisition. Strategic Priorities Powering Growth Mr. Miller continued, ""Cal-Maine Foods is advancing as a diversified and consumer-driven egg-based food company anchored by three clear priorities: expanding specialty eggs and prepared foods; pursuing disciplined, accretive M&A and leveraging operational and financial excellence. Executing on these strategic priorities in unison is driving tangible results, and positioning us for accelerated growth, broader diversification, and stronger, more consistent earnings."" Expanding Specialty Eggs and Prepared Foods Cal-Maine Foods is advancing its growth strategy by expanding specialty eggs, while building a scaled prepared foods platform across multiple formats and dayparts to meet accelerating demand for differentiated, convenient, and protein-rich foods. Specialty eggs represented 30.7% of net sales in the first quarter, supported by the company's broad portfolio spanning cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced categories. Prepared foods -- including pre-cooked egg patties, omelets, folded and scrambled egg products, hard-cooked, pancakes, and waffles -- contributed 9.1% of sales, following the Echo Lake Foods acquisition in June 2025. Together, specialty eggs and prepared foods accounted for nearly 40% of net sales in the first quarter, underscoring their central role in Cal-Maine's strategy and long-term financial performance. Specialty egg sales delivered notable gains, including double-digit dollar and volume increases in cage-free and pasture-raised, reflecting sustained consumer demand for premium products. Specialty egg growth was broad-based across channels, with retail advancing at a strong single-digit pace, foodservice posting double-digit increases, and private-label programs also expanding at a double-digit rate -- strengthening scale and further diversifying the customer base. Cal-Maine Foods is a growing house of brands, spanning nationally recognized labels, trusted regional names, and private-label programs that reach a wide spectrum of customers and consumers, including Eggland's Best®, Land O'Lakes®, Farmhouse Eggs®, 4-Grain®, Sunups®, Sunny Meadow®, MeadowCreek Foods®, and Crepini®. Notably, Cal-Maine and affiliates account for roughly half of all Eggland's Best® sales nationally, and the brand maintained its leadership position as the #1 branded specialty egg in the U.S. during the first quarter. Pursuing Disciplined, Accretive M&A Cal-Maine's strong balance sheet and robust cash flow provide the flexibility to invest organically and pursue M&A opportunities that strengthen financial returns and advance its consumer-driven growth strategy. Echo Lake Foods and Crepini Foods are compelling recent examples, expanding prepared foods into new formats and dayparts, while deepening differentiation in both retail and foodservice. These acquisitions reflect Cal-Maine's disciplined approach: targeting assets that enhance mix, improve margin profile, and build capabilities that compound long-term value. With a strong pipeline of opportunities, M&A remains an important lever to deploy capital prudently, build scale, extend reach into value-added categories, and reinforce Cal-Maine's leadership in eggs and egg-based foods. ""I'm proud to share that our acquisition of Echo Lake Foods is on track to exceed every financial and operational expectation set at the time of the transaction. Building on that strong performance, we are investing an incremental $14.8 million in a new high-speed pancake production line at our Burlington, Wisconsin facility to capture accelerating customer demand. This expansion will add 12 million pounds of annual pancake capacity, materially enhancing our operational capabilities and positioning Cal-Maine Foods for sustainable growth in the frozen breakfast category,"" said Mr. Miller. Leveraging Operational and Financial Excellence Cal-Maine's vertically integrated model is built to provide quality, safety, supply reliability, and efficiency across our operations. In-line facilities and ongoing modernization initiatives further enhanced yields and productivity during the quarter, reinforcing the company's low-cost position and enabling leading biosecurity practices at scale. The ""Cal-Maine Way"" -- combining best practices, process innovation, and talent development -- drives consistent operational execution. The company also maintains a robust balance sheet, a strategic advantage that provides full flexibility to allocate capital dynamically. Supply and Demand Dynamics U.S. egg consumption continues to be fueled by powerful consumer trends such as growing demand for protein, increased focus on health and wellness, affordability, and the steady expansion of the U.S. population. Specialty eggs and prepared food categories are capturing greater share as consumers increasingly choose products with enhanced attributes and added convenience. On the supply side, the national table-egg flock is recovering from the impacts of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) but remains below historical levels. In this environment, biosecurity is paramount. Since 2015, Cal-Maine has invested more than $80 million in advanced technology, equipment, supplies, procedures, and training to safeguard flock health. While HPAI continues to affect national supply, our rigorous measures help mitigate risk and support continuity across our operations. Looking Forward ""Looking ahead, we see a clear and compelling long-term growth trajectory for Cal-Maine Foods as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. Our significant scale, vertical integration, diversification, and financial discipline all provide a resilient foundation. Specialty eggs and prepared foods are delivering today and are value drivers for the future. Moving forward, the market will gain even more clarity, predictability, and visibility into both the existing strength of Cal-Maine Foods and the path we are building for the future,"" Mr. Miller concluded. Dividend Payment For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Cal-Maine Foods will pay a cash dividend of approximately $1.37 per share to holders of its common stock, pursuant to the company's variable dividend policy. The dividend is payable on November 13, 2025, to holders of record on October 29, 2025. The final amount paid per share will be based on the number of outstanding shares on the record date.

"When to replace your child's car seat after a crash, expert advice for parents","After a car crash, it's easy to focus on injuries and vehicle damage. But don't forget to check your child's car seat. Consumer Reports' car seat expert faced this issue herself, and her story may help parents decide what to do. Consumer Reports' car seat safety expert Emily Thomas was recently rear-ended on the highway. Thankfully, she's okay, and her kids weren't in the car. But their car seats were. That raised a big question for any parent: Do you need to replace a car seat after a crash? After a crash, it's vital to know when your child's car seat should be replaced. In minor crashes, replacement may not be necessary. However, for moderate to severe crashes, you must replace the car seat. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offers a checklist to help determine crash severity. If any checklist criteria are not met, the car seat should be replaced. ""In my case, the car seats looked fine - there was no visible damage,"" Thomas said. ""There were also no injuries sustained in the crash. The impact was at the rear of the vehicle, so the doors closest to the car seats were not damaged. However, both vehicles were towed and there was airbag deployment, so this counts as a moderate-to-severe crash, and the seats must be replaced."" Some child car seat manufacturers say you should replace their car seats after any crash. Drivers should follow the instructions of their car seat manufacturer. If the seats need to be replaced, talk to your insurance company - they might be able to cover the cost. You'll also need to properly dispose of the old car seats so no one else uses them. Remove all the covers, cut the harness straps, and mark the shell with ""Do Not Use."" Even when your kids aren't in the car, make sure their car seats are properly secured so they don't become projectiles in a car crash. If you have a booster seat, buckle it in. When riding with your kids, make sure your child is properly harnessed - snug and at the correct height. CR experts also recommend avoiding buying a used car seat if possible, but if you need a",WRAL,2025-10-01T10:26:03Z,https://www.wral.com/consumer/emily-thomas-car-seat-replacement-advice-after-crash/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.967785,0.01960784313725483

What You Need to Know About Annuities - WTOP News,"Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities... Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end. A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household's basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses -- housing, taxes, healthcare -- total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That's an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it. A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you're in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular ""fixed index"" annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Kremlin warns European leaders against plan it says would steal Russia's money,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -The Kremlin warned European leaders on Wednesday that Russia would pursue any individual or country which stole its money and cautioned that the theft of Russian assets would badly rebound on European depositories and investment. The European Union is mulling a proposal to use Russian assets frozen in Europe to fund a loan of 140 billion euros ($164.37 billion) to Ukraine. There are some $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, 210 billion euros of which is held in Europe, of which 185 billion euros is in Euroclear, a Brussels-based central securities depository; about 176 billion euros of that has become cash as the securities mature. ""We are talking about plans for the illegal seizure of Russian property. In Russian, we call that simply theft,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said that if anyone stole or misappropriated Russia's assets - or income from those assets - then ""the persons involved will be prosecuted in one way or another, they will all be called to account."" He said any countries involved would also be pursued. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that attempting to take its assets will undermine confidence in the central banking system, in the euro as a currency, and in the perception of the safety of ownership and property rights in Europe. ""These are additional steps towards the complete destruction of trust in the principle of the inviolability of property,"" Peskov said. ""The boomerang will very seriously hit those who are the main depositories, countries that are interested in investment attractiveness,"" he said.

"Indian Rupee gains on US government shutdown, RBI maintains Repo Rate at 5.5%","US government shutdown risks keep the US Dollar on the back foot. The Indian Rupee (INR) attracts bids against the US Dollar (USD) following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy announcement. The USD/INR pair falls to near 88.80 as the RBI has kept the Repo Rate steady at 5.5%, as expected, citing that the impact of the front-loaded monetary policy actions and the recent fiscal measures are still playing out. Financial market participants had already anticipated that the RBI would maintain the status quo, as it would need to perform a delicate balancing act between Goods and Services Tax (GST) cuts and dampening the export market. India's export sector has been hit badly since the increase in tariffs to 50% on imports from New Delhi to the United States (US). President Donald Trump raised the import duty on Indian products as a penalty for buying Oil from Russia. Meanwhile, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra has also warned that higher US tariffs would slow down the Indian export market. ""Higher tariffs are likely to moderate export growth,"" Malhotra said in the monetary policy statement. With the GST cuts announcement in effect, the RBI has raised the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) forecast for the current financial year to 6.8% from 6.5% projected earlier. The RBI has stated that it will continue to maintain a ""neutral"" stance on interest rates and has revised the headline inflation forecast for FY2026 downwards from 3.1% to 2.6%. USD/INR falls to near 88.80 on Wednesday. However, the near-term trend of the pair remains bullish as the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) slopes higher around 88.50. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays above 60.00, suggesting a strong bullish momentum. Looking down, the 20-day EMA will act as key support for the major. On the upside, the round figure of 90.00 would be the key hurdle for the pair.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T10:11:56Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-inr-drops-as-rbi-holds-repo-rate-steady-at-55-raises-gdp-forecasts-202510010522,2025-10-01 18:29:59.969410,-0.05882352941176472
eBay launches new AI productivity programme worth over £3m to small businesses,"A new programme worth over £3 million to skill-up small UK businesses with fully funded access to the latest custom AI productivity tools and training to free up time and boost growth has been launched by eBay. Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, the programme is open to all businesses which sell on eBay with up to 10,000 to be onboarded this year. With small businesses accounting for three-fifths of UK employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector, equipping them with the technology and skills to compete is critical to deliver growth. The programme will offer access to ChatGPT Enterprise for up to 12 months in addition to tailored training to help unlock its potential. Additional support will include a dedicated eBay team who will engage with sellers to develop custom GPTs which will be most beneficial to growing small businesses on eBay and beyond. There is strong appetite for using AI among UK small businesses, but also a need for assistance in applying it to achieve business impact. While 69% of online businesses feel excited (43%) or curious (26%) about AI's potential, many are still working out how to make best use of the technology for them. Broader AI adoption could deliver a step change in UK productivity, with the IMF estimating that the technology could add as much as £470 billion to GDP by 2035. eBay is the first online marketplace to provide OpenAI's tools and relevant training free to its small business customers. The training programme has been designed using insights from seller research and interviews which identified the greatest opportunities for AI to free up time and increase productivity. These include sessions on managing financial analysis, creating promotional campaigns and effective research. Training will take place virtually as well as moving to in-person sessions in 2026. Eve Williams, General Manager, eBay UK, said: ""The issue is no longer whether businesses should adopt AI. ""It is how quickly they can start before their competitors do. Those businesses and economies that don't invest in AI now risk being left behind. That's why eBay is investing to put world-class AI in the hands of small businesses and entrepreneurs, with no charge to them. ""We want British small businesses to win nationally and globally which means that the latest AI tools cannot be the preserve of big business. They should be in the hands of every small business in Britain."" Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Chief AI Officer, eBay, said: ""AI is reshaping ecommerce and eBay is all-in. We see this as a generational opportunity to reimagine buying and selling for our customers, powered by three decades of marketplace insights and cutting-edge models. ""With AI Activate, we're extending that vision to small businesses and making sure that they don't have to figure this out alone. Giving small businesses the same tools and advantages as big retailers means that they can innovate and grow to capitalise on the AI era."" The launch of eBay AI Activate reflects a broader focus for the company on capitalising on AI, with artificial intelligence now embedded at the heart of the business. eBay has already invested in equipping its employees with ChatGPT Enterprise globally, focusing on its use to enhance team creativity, exploration and productivity. Across the platform, more than 10 million sellers worldwide have used eBay's generative AI tools to create over 300 million listings, contributing several billion dollars of GMV, with more than 500,000 new listings generated every day. Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist at OpenAI commented: ""Small businesses power the UK economy, accounting for over 99% of the UK's firms. Yet for too long, they have not had the tools to drive increases in productivity the way larger firms do. ""This collaboration could change that. By putting world-class AI tools in the hands of 10,000 UK entrepreneurs, we're investing in the UK's economic engine. If we want to close the productivity gap, this is where to start."" Businesses can register their interest here now HERE with the programme going live in November.",Derby Telegraph,2025-10-01T10:26:34Z,https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/ebay-launches-new-ai-productivity-10540644,2025-10-01 18:29:59.969912,0.4352941176470588
Pound Sterling outperforms US Dollar amid government shutdown,"US private employers are expected to have added 50K fresh workers in September. The Pound Sterling (GBP) posts a fresh weekly high near 1.3480 against the US Dollar (USD) during the European trading session on Wednesday. The GBP/USD pair edges higher as the US Dollar underperforms its peers, with the United States (US) government entering a shutdown. At the time of press, the US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback's value against six major currencies, trades 0.25% lower on the day to near 97.50. Washington entered the dark after government funding expired at midnight on Tuesday as Republicans failed to persuade Democrats to support the short-term funding bill in the House and Senate, which was expected to extend the shutdown deadline to November 21. The impact of the federal government closure will be significant on market expectations for the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy outlook as statistical agencies warned of a halt in key economic releases, including the official employment report for September, which is yet scheduled for Friday. In response, US President Donald Trump has warned of irreversible cuts in programs favoured by Democrats for letting the government enter a shutdown. ""They're taking a risk by having a shutdown. We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,"" Trump said, Time Magazine reported. The Pound Sterling extends its winning streak against the US Dollar for the fourth trading day on Wednesday. The GBP/USD pair recovers to near the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which trades around 1.3480. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounds from 40.00. The pair is likely to remain sideways as the RSI stays inside the 40.00-60.00 range. Looking down, the August 1 low of 1.3140 will act as a key support zone.

"Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals, research finds","Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Derby Telegraph,2025-10-01T10:26:34Z,https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-10540582,2025-10-01 18:29:59.970520,-0.1294117647058823
Philippines' debt eases to 300.9 bln USD in August,"MANILA, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' outstanding debt fell to 17.47 trillion pesos (about 300.9 billion U.S. dollars) as of August, down 0.5 percent from the previous month, the Bureau of Treasury said Tuesday. The bureau attributed the decline mainly to the government's full repayment of its largest domestic bond this year, worth 516.34 billion pesos (about 8.9 billion dollars), as well as a stronger peso, which reduced the value of external obligations. The share of domestic debt to total borrowings rose to 69.2 percent from 68.9 percent in July, reflecting what the bureau described as ""a more favorable debt position"" as domestic borrowings are less vulnerable to foreign exchange fluctuations. Domestic debt stood at 12.09 trillion pesos (about 208 billion dollars) in August, while external debt declined to 5.38 trillion pesos (about 92.7 billion dollars). From January to August, the national government raised 1.84 trillion pesos (about 31.7 billion dollars) in gross domestic financing, including proceeds from the highly d Retail Treasury Bond Tranche 31. The government's guaranteed debt also dropped to 346.46 billion pesos (about 6 billion dollars) in August, mainly due to the stronger peso.

The US Dollar is trimming some losses during Wednesday's European trading session as the impact of the US government shutdown wears off. The USD/CHF has bounced from session lows at 07930, returning to 0.7960, although it remains relatively far away from last week's highs above 0.8000. Investors have been selling the Greenback across the board this week, as the market braced for a US federal government shutdown that finally took place on Wednesday. The differences between Democrats and republicans about government funding have led to the first government closure in 7 years and are threatening to delay the release of Friday's key Nonfarm Payrolls report. On the macroeconomic front, US JOLTS Openings increased moderately in August, but the lower hiring rate keeps investors' concerns about a cooling labour market intact, and is feeding hopes that the Fed will have to cut rates again later this month. The focus today is on the US ADP employment report, which, barring exception, is unlikely to alter this view. The US economy is expected to have created 50K jobs in September, below the 54K seen in August and well below last year's average figures. In Switzerland, SNB's president, Martin Schlegel, affirmed that inflation is expected to rise slightly in the coming quarters, while the economy points to moderate growth. This endorses the bank's will to maintain interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future, and provides some support to the CHF.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T09:51:24Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-chf-bounces-up-and-reaches-07960-as-the-us-dollar-pares-losses-202510010951,2025-10-01 18:29:59.971043,0.08235294117647052
How to let Namibia's oil discoveries become a blessing,"By Dr John Steytler, Founding Member and MD of R&J Steytler. Namibia is on the cusp of a historic transformation with her recent offshore oil discoveries which has the potential to turn the country into one of Africa's major energy producers. In previous articles, wearing my economist hat, I spoke of the need to avoid the 'resource curse' and the Dutch disease. Many newspaper columns have been filled by other professionals, both nationally and internationally, wagging a finger and speaking of a potentially bleak outlook for Namibia, apart from a few lucky well-connected individuals. Other countries can serve as cautionary tales in the handling of their newfound oil riches. I don't want to name specific countries, as naming and shaming serves no purpose. Namibia must embrace the challenge of harnessing oil revenues for sustainable development while avoiding the traps of mismanagement and overdependence. Some countries that discovered oil assumed and anticipated immediate wealth for everyone. Large oil discoveries come with the investment of billions of US dollars from oil majors. Despite the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in extracting oil resources, a windfall for all did not materialize. Poverty remained widespread, with citizens feeling they received scant benefits from the petrodollars. There are many reasons for this. Analyzing these reasons and understanding how to avoid some of the pitfalls is how Namibia can turn the oil discoveries into a blessing for every Namibian. Weak institutions and governance gaps, coupled with a lack of stringent regulatory and oversight frameworks, create an environment where opaque contracts and limited accountability become the norm. It is very positive to see that Namibia is very conscientious in setting up its governance structures. The direct engagement that the government has with oil companies and supplier companies to ensure that Namibia benefits from more than just tax revenue shows that Namibia is serious about guaranteeing that oil and revenue benefit every Namibian. The government seems to recognize that it has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the socio-economic status of every Namibian, if the oil revenue is managed prudently. It will be essential to channel the revenue and the local opportunities into creating broad-based improvements in healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Namibia has in fact established the Welwitschia Fund, a sovereign wealth fund modelled after successful examples, such as Norway and Botswana's. It is particularly encouraging that the Welwitschia Fund has strict withdrawal limits and a strong mandate to invest for the country's long-term future. To avoid the risks of the so-called Dutch disease which affects several countries because of the influx of oil money, it is essential to plan and project sensibly and for the long term. For Namibia, the lesson is that oil wealth alone does not guarantee prosperity. Oil revenues must translate into tangible improvements and jobs. Funds should be earmarked for healthcare, education, and rural development. By addressing inequality and poverty directly, the government can ensure that oil wealth benefits all citizens, not just elites or foreign investors. We must not be overly reliant on oil revenues; we need to divest from oil as the revenue starts flowing. The oil revenues must catalyze, creating an environment that promotes the growth of these other sectors. If global oil prices fall, we must be resilient enough as an economy to weather potential price shocks. Regrettably, we must address corruption and mismanagement. There are numerous examples of countries worldwide where billions in oil revenues were siphoned off through patronage networks and poorly managed state enterprises. The President, H.E. Dr Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, has vowed to stamp out corruption in any form in Namibia. This is great, and if we get this right, our country's oil resources will truly become a blessing. Namibians recognize that oil can be both a blessing and a curse. We must embrace the principles of Harambee and pull together to ensure that oil will be a blessing for every Namibian. Namibia's oil discoveries present a once-in-a-generation opportunity. By building strong institutions, managing revenues transparently, diversifying the economy, and investing in its people, Namibia can chart its own course, continually building on and borrowing from best practices and case studies. Oil should not define Namibia; it should be its blessing and finance its future.",Namibia Economist,2025-10-01T10:19:53Z,https://economist.com.na/101097/speak-your-mind/how-to-let-namibias-oil-discoveries-become-a-blessing/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.971594,0.07450980392156858
PENGASSAN to suspend strike as FG brokers peace with Dangote Refinery,"The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) is set to suspend its nationwide strike after the Federal Government brokered peace between the union and Dangote Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited. The industrial action, which began on Monday, September 29, was triggered by the disengagement of more than 800 workers at the refinery. PENGASSAN had also threatened to halt gas supply to the facility and withdraw services nationwide. Following two days of conciliation led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Mohammed Maigari Dingyadi, both parties reached a resolution on Tuesday, according to a statement issued by the Ministry's Spokesperson Patience Onuobia on Wednesday. Onuobia said the a communique issued after the meeting, noted that the disengaged staff will be redeployed to other companies within the Dangote Group without any loss of pay. The agreement also guarantees that no worker will face victimisation for their role in the dispute. ""The Minister of Labour informed the meeting that unionisation is a right of workers in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and that this right should be respected,"" the communique stated. The peace deal was reached in the presence of key government officials, including the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, the Minister of State for Labour, and chief executives of major petroleum industry regulators, alongside security chiefs. While PENGASSAN maintained that its strike was in response to the ""unjust termination"" of its members, Dangote Refinery insisted the layoffs were part of an ongoing reorganisation within the company.",The Sun Nigeria,2025-10-01T10:21:35Z,https://thesun.ng/pengassan-to-suspend-strike-as-fg-brokers-peace-with-dangote-refinery/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.971796,0.1137254901960785

"UPDATE 1-Samsung, SK Hynix to supply memory chips to OpenAI's Stargate project","SEOUL: Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers, they said on Wednesday, as South Korean chipmakers join forces with the ChatGPT maker to meet rising demand from its Stargate project. The announcements were made on Wednesday after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and the chairmen of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix at the presidential office in central Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the $500 billion Stargate project in January, charging OpenAI and partners including SoftBank and Oracle with ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in artificial intelligence. Expanding chip availability was one of the key ideas of the project, and Nvidia said last week it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips. FIRMS SEEN SUPPLYING MUCH OF OPENAI'S STARGATE CHIP DEMAND South Korea's presidential office said OpenAI's chip demand for Stargate was expected to reach 900,000 wafers a month, and OpenAI hoped to source much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix. It added that the supply timeline had not yet been decided. The office said the partnership gave South Korean chipmakers an early foothold in the world's largest AI infrastructure project, providing a growth opportunity for the domestic chip industry. Samsung and SK Hynix together hold about 70% of the global Dynamic Random Access Memory chip market and nearly 80% of the HBM market. HBM - a type of DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications. OpenAI this year set up its first office in Seoul as South Korean demand for its ChatGPT service surged. The country has the largest number of paying ChatGPT rs after the United States, according to OpenAI.",ETTelecom.com,2025-10-01T10:19:28Z,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/devices/update-1-samsung-sk-hynix-to-supply-memory-chips-to-openais-stargate-project/124256136,2025-10-01 18:29:59.972492,0.2078431372549019
Saudi-Lebanese Business Council Launched to Revive Economic Ties,"Saudi Arabia and Lebanon have announced the formation of a joint business council, a move seen as a step toward restoring economic cooperation after years of strained relations. Business leaders say the initiative reflects Riyadh's intention to re-engage with Beirut and open new channels for trade and investment. Raouf Abou Zaki, President of the Lebanese-Saudi Business Council, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the announcement ""goes beyond a procedural step to signal a gradual warming of ties."" He added that the council ""lays the foundation for a new phase of partnership between the two countries."" Abou Zaki recently visited Riyadh, where he met Hassan Al-Huwaizi, President of the Federation of Saudi Chambers, and Secretary-General Waleed Alorainan. The meetings resulted in an agreement in principle to hold a joint council session. He described this as ""a clear sign of Saudi Arabia's willingness to reconnect and restore economic relations to their natural track."" He stressed that while Saudi Arabia advances its Vision 2030 transformation, Lebanon urgently needs Arab, and particularly Saudi support to drive reforms and rebuild its economy. The joint council is expected to serve as a key platform for boosting trade flows, attracting investments, and creating partnerships in infrastructure, finance, tourism, energy, and technology. Lebanese business leaders believe the initiative could deliver a much-needed boost to the country's struggling economy and return it to the regional investment map. According to Abou Zaki, the move reflects ""implicit support for Lebanon's stability and encouragement to continue economic and administrative reforms demanded by the international community."" He also framed it as part of Riyadh's broader strategy to strengthen Arab economic integration in the face of global challenges. Abou Zaki stressed that naming members to the council ""is not just a protocol measure but a message of reassurance that Lebanon remains part of its Arab environment, and that the Kingdom still views it as a vital market and a potential regional hub once conditions allow."" He added that reactivating the council ""marks an important step in putting Saudi-Lebanese relations back on track, turning the page on stagnation, and opening new prospects for political and economic stability.""",Asharq Al-Awsat English,2025-10-01T10:14:23Z,https://english.aawsat.com/node/5192465,2025-10-01 18:29:59.972756,0.2549019607843137

Silver price today: rises on October 1,"Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

SUJAN celebrates 25 years of sharing exceptional hospitality while positively impacting thousands of lives and protecting India's biodiversity,"PRNewswire New Delhi [India], October 1: The 30th of September 2025 marked a significant milestone in Indian luxury hospitality as SUJAN celebrates twenty five years of excellence, innovation, and purpose-driven luxury tourism. It was in October 2000 that Sher Bagh, SUJAN's pioneering tented camp in Ranthambhore, first opened to guests from around the world. Today, SUJAN stands as a symbol of responsible luxury and transformative experiences, deeply rooted in India's cultural and natural heritage. Sher Bagh - The Iconic SUJAN Camp in Ranthambhore - Marks a Quarter Century. Founded by Jaisal Singh, aged just 20 years old, SUJAN began as a vision to redefine the way travellers connected with the wild, the land, and the communities around them. Sher Bagh was the first luxury camp of its kind in India, inspired by a family's deep rooted love and commitment to Ranthambhore. It was designed to deliver immersive wildlife encounters in one of the country's most celebrated tiger reserves. ""SUJAN was born out of our love for Ranthambhore and our belief that true luxury lies in authenticity, making a difference, and storytelling,"" said Jaisal Singh, Founder & CEO of SUJAN. ""Twenty-five years on, we remain committed to creating meaningful journeys that conserve our wildlife, support local communities, and protect India's rich heritage."" Over the past two and a half decades, SUJAN has expanded to include a distinguished portfolio of exceptional properties across Rajasthan, including SUJAN The Serai, Jaisalmer and SUJAN JAWAI, Jawai Bandh, each with its own distinct character and strong conservation ethos. Key highlights of SUJAN's 25-year journey: * Over 100,000 trees planted across their properties * Over 150 sq. km under protection in the Jawai region through their rewilding project * 13 schools under the care of SUJAN benefitting 11,667 students * 55,839 patients treated from SUJAN's free Mobile Medical Unit in Jawai since 2018 * 80.5% of all employees are from the state of Rajasthan * Multiple community development programs in rural Rajasthan, including healthcare, education, and women's empowerment impacting over 22,500 individuals * A conservation contribution model where a portion of every guest's stay supports community and conservation projects. * SUJAN JAWAI awarded in the Worlds 50 Best Hotels in 2024, the only hotel in India to make this prestigious list. * SUJAN Sher Bagh, was awarded Tatler 101 Best Hotels in 2001 and again in 2024- maintaining consistency throughout the decades. * SUJAN Sher Bagh has been awarded in the 2025 Conde Nast Traveller Readers' Choice Awards, as well as its Gold List & Best Family Hotels in the World. * No other hotel company in India has committed more to communities and conservation. Protecting India's wilderness Long before SUJAN's inception, the intention behind SUJAN's mindset existed in spirit. Their very first property was built on land that Jaisal's parents, and late Uncle Valmik Thapar, purchased in the 1970s. To live the SUJAN life today is to enjoy exceptional travel experiences that enrich and rejuvenate one's soul, whilst making a measurable positive impact on parts of the planet that the family knows and treasures. Today, SUJAN has a presence in three regions of Rajasthan, where the philosophy of the original camp remains true: the recovery and restoration of the wildernesses the family calls home, in partnership with non-profit conservation partners and the communities in each region. As SUJAN commemorates twenty five years of sharing these magnificent wildernesses with their guests, and in so doing, helping to ensure their protection, they now look to what's next, and what more can be done. With new regions on the horizon for SUJAN, their dedication to their founding goal is stronger than ever, and as always, they will only develop new concepts that are better or as good as the ones they already have. This is to guarantee that they continue to deliver a consistently excellent guest experience and remain steadfast in support of their mission to ensure that the land and communities always benefit through SUJAN's presence. Looking Ahead As SUJAN looks ahead, it continues to lead with purpose, exploring new experiences that remain anchored in its core values of conservation, culture, and conscious travel. With new projects on the horizon and soon to be announced, SUJAN looks forward to sharing more about the next chapter. About SUJAN SUJAN is a family-owned, award-winning collection of experiential luxury camps and palaces in India. With a commitment to conservation, community, and craft, SUJAN delivers transformative journeys that honour India's natural landscapes and cultural traditions.

Trump tariffs push rest of world to forge new trade alliances,"US President Donald Trump's import tariffs have breathed life into dormant free trade talks across the globe and driven alliances at an unrivalled pace between partners seeking to offset lost exports to the United States. Since Trump's re-election last November, the European Union has struck three free trade agreements - with South American bloc Mercosur, Mexico and Indonesia - and has its sights on a fourth, with India, by the end of this year. The EU is not alone. Mercosur has sealed a free trade deal with the four-nation European Free Trade Area and relaunched negotiations with Canada that were stalled in 2021. India and New Zealand revived talks after a decade-long hiatus, while the United Arab Emirates signed three trade agreements in a single day in January. Brussels has been clear it sees new alliances as part of its response to ""unjustified"" US tariffs of broadly 15 per cent on EU goods and to Chinese oversupply and export restrictions on critical mineral the EU needs for its green transition. Countries looking beyond the US The new trade pacts may not fully compensate for losses in commerce with a more protectionist America - time will tell - but rival economies have been spurred into action nonetheless. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic told lawmakers last month in a debate about the one-sided EU-US tariff deal struck at the end of July that the United States, which represented 17 per cent of EU trade last year, was ""not the only game in town"". ""We also need to take care of the other 83%. That means continuing our efforts to diversify our relations,"" he said. The message has been taken on board by countries previously reluctant to open their markets, including India and France, whose opposition to the EU-Mercosur deal seems to have softened. The trend has also been welcomed by World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as long as the agreements concur with WTO rules. ""Members negotiating more agreements with each other, that helps to diversify trade, it supports the WTO. It's not in competition because most of these agreements are built on our platform,"" she said last month. Short-term impact of deals limited But will new alliances offset US tariffs? In the short-term, no. The impact of US tariffs is immediate, while the benefits of new trade agreements are years away, because of potentially lengthy approval processes and tariff cuts that are often staged over five to 10 years. Investment to take advantage of those benefits could kick in sooner though. Longer term, it is unclear. New trade deals will eke out decimal points of economic growth, while EU exports to the United States and China, where demand for EU goods has slumped, make up roughly 4 per cent of EU GDP. But not all of that will be lost. Niclas Poitiers, research fellow at the Bruegel think tank, says average estimates for the Trump tariff impact on EU exports imply a 0.2-0.3 per cent decline of GDP for the bloc, though the impact of uncertainty on corporate investment may be less benign. Poitiers said trade agreements have political value too by offering stable relations at a time when the United States is undermining the global economic order and pushing through deals that are not compliant with World Trade Organization rules. ""It's about making sure that your trading relationships are not just reliant on international rules, which are much less firm these days, but are also bound by a bilateral treaty,"" he said. What may emerge is a network of deals underpinning the multilateral system, but excluding the United States and to some extent China. Sabine Weyand, director-general of the EU executive's trade division, told a European Parliament hearing last week that the EU was presenting itself as ""the reliable trading partner for the rest of the world"". Sander Tordoir, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, said Europe could lead a 'rest of the band' group, but noted that it and others such as Japan ran trade surpluses and so needed buyers, not more sellers. ""The challenge is enormous,"" he said. ""The US has long constituted about 50 per cent of global trade deficits, acting as a key source of incremental demand for global exports."" So the band would have to find ways to create demand for each other's exports while pushing back against Chinese overcapacity. For the European Union, the rest of the world would be too small and the only economy big enough to offset the United States and China was its own. ""Europe will need to stoke internal demand or face stagnation,"" Tordoir said.

How to use tech in the garden and still keep your serenity,"This undated image provided by Click & Grow shows plants growing in a Click & Grow smart garden on a table beside a window. (Click & Grow via AP) Gardening tools are evolving to incorporate technology -- including artificial intelligence -- to help us keep plants healthier, avoid unpleasant tasks and even grow crops indoors over winter. And we can use them without losing the stress-relieving, analog benefits that nature provides. Here are just a few examples: If you don't enjoy mowing the lawn, you can buy a robot that will do it for you. Many self-guided mowers, like the Segway Navimow, Husqvarna Automower, the Sunseeker X7 and others, will handle the task on a schedule, run quietly, then return to a charging station without human intervention (beyond setup). And many can be controlled with a mobile app. Some autonomous lawn mowers use AI technology to adapt to your grass' growth. Sensors reroute them around pets, children, patio tables and garden decor. Unsure about whether your plants need watering or are getting sufficient sunlight? There are apps for that. If you're a busy type who could use watering, fertilizing, pruning and repotting reminders, apps like Planta or Plant Parent can help keep you on track. Provide info on an individual plant or create an inventory of all your green friends, and it will tailor a schedule for each, then notify you when it's time to provide those maintenance tasks. Physical monitoring devices can take things a step further. A gadget like FloraPod, for example, when plunged into soil -- indoors or out -- will send your phone real-time details about moisture levels, humidity, temperature and light exposure, plus care recommendations for thousands of plant species. So-called smart gardens are self-watering, self-fertilizing and self-lighting units that enable users to grow herbs and vegetables indoors year-round. They're available in a variety of sizes to accommodate a single plant or even dozens. Some, like Gardyn and AeroGarden, rely on soil-less hydroponic systems; others, like the Click & Grow system, use pods filled with traditional growing media. ___ Jessica Damiano writes weekly gardening columns for the AP and publishes the award-winning Weekly Dirt Newsletter.

WTI Price Forecast: Struggles near $61.50 as bearish outlook persists,"The technical setup favors bearish traders and backs the case for a further depreciating move. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) US Crude Oil prices extend last week's retracement slide from the $66.20 region, or the highest level since August 4, and drift lower for the fourth successive day on Wednesday. The commodity slides to an over one-week low, around the $61.85-$61.80 region during the first half of the European session, though it lacks follow-through selling. Concerns that a prolonged US government shutdown could have an adverse effect on the economy and dent fuel demand, which turns out to be a key factor weighing on Crude Oil prices. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ denied speculation regarding a hike in Oil production in its upcoming meeting on Sunday, which, in turn, could offers support to the black liquid and help limit any further losses. From a technical perspective, last week's failure near the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the subsequent fall could be seen as a key trigger for bearish traders. Moreover, oscillators on the daily chart have again started gaining negative traction and validate the negative outlook, suggesting that the path of least resistance for Crude Oil prices is to the downside. Some follow-through selling below the $61.50-$61.30 area, or a multi-month low touched in September, should pave the way for deeper losses. Crude Oil prices might then accelerate the fall below the $61.00 mark, towards testing an intermediate support near the $60.40-$60.30 intermediate support en route to the late May swing low, around the $60.00 psychological mark. On the flip side, any meaningful recovery attempt beyond the $62.00 mark now seems to confront an immediate hurdle near the daily top, around the $62.65-$62.70 region. A sustained strength beyond could trigger a short-covering move and lift Crude Oil prices beyond the $63.00 round figure, towards the $63.60-$63.65 hurdle en route to the $64.00 mark and the $64.25 region.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T09:28:53Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/wti-price-forecast-languishes-near-6150-support-zone-seems-vulnerable-202510010928,2025-10-01 18:29:59.975562,-0.3960784313725491

EUR/USD pulls back from daily highs despite higher Eurozoner inflation,"The shutdown of the US federal government keeps the US Dollar on the defensive. EUR/USD is, trading at.1750 at the time of writing, down from daily highs near 1.1780. The Eurozone preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has met expectations, yet the US Dollar remains on the defensive as the US federal government shut down earlier in the day, due to irreconcilable divergences between the two main parties on government funding. Eurozone inflation data confirmed that price pressures accelerated to a 2.2% yearly rate in September from 2% in August, although the core inflation remained growing at a steady 2.3%. Monthly inflation eased to 0.1%, from 0.3% in the previous month, while the core HICP remained steady at 0.1%. All in all, figures in line with the market expectations that have failed to provide any further support to the Euro. In the US, a last-minute vote in the US Senate failed to pass the Republicans' funding bill, leading to the government's closure. The economic impact should not be significant unless the situation extends in time. However, it might delay the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday, which is a key data point for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision due in late October. US JOLTS Job Openings data was mixed on Tuesday, showing a slight increase in job vacancies but less hiring. Later today, the ADP Employment Change report is expected to show that private payrolls increased by 50K in September, a poor reading compared with last year's averages and further evidence that employment creation has stalled. EUR/USD is under moderate bullish pressure on Wednesday. The 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) advances through positive territory beyond the 50 level, currently at 64, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains above the signal line. With the US Dollar Index (DXY) on the defensive, correlation studies suggest that further appreciation is on the cards. Bulls have yet to confirm above Tuesday's highs around 1.1760, which are being tested at the time of writing. Further up, the next target is the reverse broken trendline, now at 1.1790. A successful break of that level would cancel the bearish trend from mid-September highs and shift the focus towards the September 23 and 24 highs, near 1.1820. To the downside, immediate support is at the 1.1710-1.1715 area, where the pair was contained on Tuesday. Further down, last week's lows at the 1.1645-1.1655 area and the September 2 and 3 lows, near 1.1610, come into focus.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T09:24:06Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-usd-extends-gains-with-all-eyes-on-eurozone-inflation-figures-202510010808,2025-10-01 18:29:59.975948,-0.003921568627450966
UK manufacturing activity shrinks at fastest pace for five months,"Activity in the UK manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace for five months in September after orders dropped, according to new figures. The downturn came as firms linked to the car industry also warned that their supply chains were affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 46.2 for the month, decreasing from 47.0 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting. It was in line with economist expectations for the month. The survey showed a reduction in both domestic demand and export orders for the month as companies highlighted ""challenging"" market sentiment. Manufacturers said they scaled back production as a result, marking the 11th consecutive month of declining production. Worsening market conditions were also linked to weaker client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and higher costs. Employment in the sector also slumped again, with companies reporting that they reduced headcount to offset higher costs following increases to the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. ""Manufacturers are facing an increasingly challenging environment, with intakes of new business and levels of production hit by weak market sentiment, a dearth of new export work and a high-cost environment exacerbated by tax and labour cost rises. ""Companies entwined into the autos supply chain are also facing a temporary hit to activity following the cyber-attack on JLR."" Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The weakness in September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) may be exaggerated by businesses' concerns over tax rises at the upcoming Autumn Budget and temporary factory closures in the automotive sector. ""However, the sector certainly faces weak domestic and external demand as it navigates slowing real income growth, tightening fiscal policy, and a global economy that is still getting to grips with higher US tariffs.""",Kidderminster Shuttle,2025-10-01T09:57:22Z,https://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/news/national/25508368.uk-manufacturing-activity-shrinks-fastest-pace-five-months/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.976217,-0.1372549019607843

Families in Cork in 'in limbo': Call for swift publication of new housing plan,"Families in Cork ""cannot afford to be left in limbo"" while government parties stall on housing solutions, a city councillor has said, calling for the swift publication of the Government's new housing plan. It had been expected the revised Housing for All plan would be published prior to the Dáil summer recess, but it was pushed back, reportedly until a review of the National Development Plan was completed. At an event by Cork Simon last week, Cork TD and minister of state at the department of housing, Christopher O'Sullivan, said the department was ""finalising"" the new plan. Labour Cork city councillor John Maher has called for it to be delivered urgently, telling The Echo: ""Every week across Cork city, I hear from people living in housing insecurity, facing impossible rent, or unable to find affordable homes. ""The lack of urgency from government is appalling. Instead of targeted, costed measures, we get spin and excuses. Families in Glanmire, Ballyvolane, and Mayfield deserve better than the endless cycle of announcements and inaction. ""We need a strategy that directly addresses the shortage of skilled construction workers. The ESRI has warned this week that rising construction wages are increasing house prices, pushing home ownership further out of reach. ""The programme for government committed to 12,500 new apprentices per year by 2030, but with only 30,000 apprentices currently in the labour market, the Government must set out how this target will be met. ""Back in February, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council warned that more workers would be needed for house building, retrofitting, and infrastructure projects. The Government ignored it. Instead, they cling to private developers who routinely pause projects waiting for more subsidies. That approach is failing families in Cork, where demand is only growing. The truth is Ireland needs 300,000 new homes. Housing for All has failed.""",Echo Live,2025-10-01T10:16:00Z,https://www.echolive.ie/corknews/arid-41715681.html,2025-10-01 18:29:59.976549,-0.05882352941176472

USD/CAD stays above 1.3900 due to lower Oil prices,"The CME FedWatch Tool indicates the pricing in a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October. USD/CAD moves sideways after registering gains in the previous session, hovering around 1.3920 at the time of writing during the European hours on Wednesday. The USD/CAD pair may appreciate as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) could face challenges amid declining Crude Oil prices. It is worth noting that Canada is the largest Oil exporter to the United States (US). Canada's S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and BoC Summary of Deliberations will also be eyed later in the North American session. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) extends its losing streak, trading around $61.80 per barrel at the time of writing. Oil prices fall as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, known as OPEC+, signaled a larger output increase for next month, while uncertainty over a potential US government shutdown raised concerns about economic activity and fuel demand. However, the US Dollar (USD) faces challenges after the latest jobs figures from the United States (US), which boosted the likelihood of further Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in 2025. The CME FedWatch Tool suggests that markets are now pricing in nearly a 97% chance of a Fed rate cut in October and a 76% possibility of another reduction in December. Traders are likely to await September's US ADP Employment Change and ISM Manufacturing PMI data later in the day, though their release could be disrupted by the government shutdown.

Greggs shoppers 'devastated' as 'delicious' product axed for returning favourite,"Greggs has left shoppers ""devastated"" after removing a product described by shoppers as ""delicious"" and ""amazing"" from its menu. The British bakery chain offers a wide range of products, including coffees, sandwiches, sweet treats, and pastries (which include the famous Greggs sausage roll).

Describing the new drink, the retailer said: ""Made with a peach flavour syrup and tea extract, our Peach Iced Tea is a sure-fire way to make life sweeter sip by sip."" Peach Iced Tea proved an instant hit among shoppers. One person, commenting on a post on the Greggs Facebook page, said: ""The peach tea is delicious and so refreshing.""

The 19th CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CONFERENCE was held in Kyiv,"On September 26, Kyiv hosted the 19th CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CONFERENCE, the only cross-industry event in Ukraine that brought together business leaders and experts in the field of customer experience. This year's theme, ""A System for Profit,"" was a response to a key challenge for companies: how to make customer experience not a one-time initiative, but an operating system that has a consistent impact on profit, reputation, and business development. The conference was attended offline and online by 500 top managers, team leaders, and experts from various industries who strive to create effective service standards. In her welcoming speech, KA Group founder Alona Zhupikova emphasized that customer experience always marks the beginning of a new stage of development: ""Customers change, contexts change, technologies change. CX is a living organism, and the task of business is to understand how it works and respond in a timely manner."" She stressed that it is data research, language analytics, and the implementation of AI solutions that help predict customer needs and create products of the future. Olena Tsysar, an international expert in strategic development at SK, presented a model of customer experience maturity, which she described as a ""mosaic"" of three elements: motivation, organization, and culture. ""Our main goal is to bring the customer's voice back into the business. CX is not just about standards or handling complaints. It's about humanity and respect for the journey of each customer and employee,"" she emphasized. Kirill Yezhov, Business Development Director at Kantar Ukraine, continued the theme. He stressed that without clear metrics and accountability, customer experience remains just a good idea: ""82% of CEOs worldwide consider customer experience to be a growth factor. But real results only come when a company can not only listen to the customer, but also act quickly based on data."" He presented an approach that combines X-Data (customer emotions and experiences) and O-Data (operational metrics), emphasizing the importance of consistency in processes, roles, and culture in creating a CX management system. Examples of change: from a bank to a super-premium brand Yulia Moroz, Sales Director at Oschadbank, shared her experience of a large-scale service transformation. Thanks to automation and multi-channel services, more than 70% of customer inquiries are now handled by a voice assistant. ""The customer is the starting point for all changes. Only when CX works as a team system does the customer receive fast and seamless service,"" she noted. Every year, Oschadbank processes 400,000 requests and remains the only bank that has mobile branches even in frontline territories. Oleksandr Kotolup, founder of Figaro Catering, continued this theme. He focused on the importance of emotions in service: ""The WOW effect is an emotion of surprise and joy that brings money, repeat customers, and high loyalty. Emotions work, and they need to be directed in the same way as the fashion industry does."" Igor Blystiv, Director of Marketing and Innovation at Kormotech, explained how working with three key audiences -- veterinarians, breeders, and end consumers -- enabled the company to build an entire ecosystem for the Optimeal brand, which strengthened its position in the market. ""Look at the customer on the scale of the entire ecosystem. Create long-term initiatives that become pieces of a larger puzzle,"" emphasized Igor Blystiv. Journey management in action Oleg Koss, founder of Lanka.CX, focused on dynamic customer journey maps. He explained that journey management should be a living tool integrated into the daily work of teams. According to international research, implementing this approach results in: ""Complex services need a conductor. Journey management synchronizes teams and helps them focus on a common result,"" the expert noted. Simplicity as a strategy Mykola Chumak, co-founder and CEO of IDNT, concluded the substantive part of the presentations with the topic of simplicity in services and products. ""Simplicity is not minimalism. It is a strategic cleansing of the superfluous, which allows customers to interact with the company quickly and clearly,"" explained Mykola Chumak. He highlighted five principles of simplicity: empathy, understanding complexity, focus, human language, and attractive design. They talked about how to combine analytics and creativity so that data not only records results but also helps create a better experience for customers. Mykola Umanets, Head of Customer Experience Development at Uklon: metrics must be based on real needs, otherwise they will remain numbers without any real impact. Maria Nevzorova, Director of Technical Support, Service, and Repair at Ajax Systems: shared her experience of scaling support services without losing a personalized approach to customers. Customer voice and innovation The second panel discussion brought together representatives from Dnipro-M, DILA, WOG, NovaIT, and Revisior. They discussed how to integrate customer voice into product strategy and create a culture of rapid feedback. Vladislav Zhilikhovsky, Dnipro-M, emphasized that speech analytics allows businesses to hear customers in real time and gain insights that change the quality of service and speed of decision-making. Iryna Dergachova, DILA, added: ""Speech analytics minimizes manipulation because it is based on real customer voices, not assumptions. Another key point was the technological approach presented by Oleg Kushil, WOG, and Dmytro Romaniuk, NovaIT. They explained how modern algorithms help to quickly analyze thousands of customer conversations and identify problems before they become critical. The experts agreed that companies that quickly test ideas and feedback become more resilient to market changes and are able to launch new services faster than their competitors. Practice: CX as a winning strategy To not only hear ideas but also experience their impact, participants took part in a workshop led by Marina Bereziuk, a business psychologist and service expert. The approach is based on understanding service as an interconnected structure where each element influences the other. Working in teams, participants modeled their own customer experience systems, focusing on four key components: people, processes, monitoring, and motivation. This exercise showed how even small changes in one element can transform the entire system. Participants' insights The conclusion of the conference was a kind of summary in the form of joint reflection. Participants shared their own discoveries and key ideas that they will take with them to work. Roman Orlov, Kron: ""Before the conference, I thought that customer experience was just surveys and changes. Now I see that it is a holistic system where all the tools work together."" Ruslana Kharuk, EverHelp: ""An impressive customer experience is impossible without a quality employee experience. This is the foundation of success."" Dmytro Pashko, marketing consultant: ""Customer experience is becoming the main currency of business. Marketing departments are transforming into CX marketing, which deeply studies customer behavior and becomes a point of change within the company.""

"Samsung, SK Hynix to supply memory chips to OpenAI's Stargate project","SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers, they said on Wednesday, as South Korean chipmakers join forces with the ChatGPT maker to meet rising demand from its Stargate project. The announcements were made on Wednesday after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and the chairmen of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix at the presidential office in central Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the $500 billion Stargate project in January, charging OpenAI and partners including SoftBank and Oracle with ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in artificial intelligence. Expanding chip availability was one of the key ideas of the project, and Nvidia said last week it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips. FIRMS SEEN SUPPLYING MUCH OF OPENAI'S STARGATE CHIP DEMAND South Korea's presidential office said OpenAI's chip demand for Stargate was expected to reach 900,000 wafers a month, and OpenAI hoped to source much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix. It added that the supply timeline had not yet been decided. The office said the partnership gave South Korean chipmakers an early foothold in the world's largest AI infrastructure project, providing a growth opportunity for the domestic chip industry. Samsung and SK Hynix together hold about 70% of the global Dynamic Random Access Memory chip market and nearly 80% of the HBM market. HBM - a type of DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications. OpenAI this year set up its first office in Seoul as South Korean demand for its ChatGPT service surged. The country has the largest number of paying ChatGPT rs after the United States, according to OpenAI. (Reporting by Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin.

Nigeria@65: Read Full Text Of President Bola Tinubu's Broadcast To Nigerians - OsunDefender,"President Bola Tinubu on Wednesday delivered a national address to Nigerians to mark the 65th anniversary of Nigeria's Independence Day 2025. President Tinubu reflected on Nigeria's journey since 1960 independence and paid tribute to national heroes. Read the full speech below: NATIONAL BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY BOLA AHNED TINUBU, GCFR, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE 65TH INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY OF NIGERIA, OCTOBER 1, 2025. Today marks the 65th anniversary of our great nation's Independence. As we reflect on the significance of this day and our journey of nationhood since October 1, 1960, when our founding fathers accepted the instruments of self-government from colonial rule, let us remember their sacrifice, devotion, and grand dream of a strong, prosperous, and united Nigeria that will lead Africa and be the beacon of light to the rest of the world. 2. Our founding heroes and heroines -- Herbert Macaulay, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Margaret Ekpo, Anthony Enahoro, Ladoke Akintola, Michael Okpara, Aminu Kano, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, and other nationalists Air Jordan 1 Centre Court Olive -- believed it was Nigeria's manifest destiny to lead the entire black race as the largest black nation on earth. 3. For decades, the promise of our Independence has been tested by profound social, economic, and political challenges, and we have survived. While we may not have achieved all the lofty dreams of our forebearers, we have not strayed too far from them. In 65 years since our Independence, we have made tremendous progress in economic growth, social cohesion, and physical development. Our economy has experienced significant growth since 1960. 4. Although it is much easier for those whose vocation is to focus solely on what ought to be, we must recognise and celebrate our significant progress. Nigerians today have access to better education and healthcare than in 1960. At Independence, Nigeria had 120 secondary schools with a student population of about 130,000. Available data indicate that, as of 2024, there were more than 23,000 secondary schools in our country. At Independence, we had only the University of Ibadan and Yaba College of Technology as the two tertiary institutions in Nigeria. By the end of last year, there were 274 universities, 183 Polytechnics, and 236 Colleges of Education in Nigeria, comprising Federal, State, and private institutions. We have experienced a significant surge in growth across every sector of our national life since Independence - in healthcare, infrastructure, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, information technology, aviation and defence, among others. 5. Our country has experienced both the good and the bad times in its 65 years of nationhood, as is normal for every nation and its people. We fought a bitter and avoidable civil war, experienced military air jordan 6 toro dictatorships, and lived through major political crises. In all these, we weathered every storm and overcame every challenge with courage, grit, and uncommon determination. While our system and ties that bind us are sometimes stretched by insidious forces opposed to our values and ways of life, we continue to strive to build a more perfect union where every Nigerian can find better accommodation and find purpose and fulfilment. 6. Fellow Compatriots, this is the third time I will address you on our independence anniversary since I assumed office as your President on May 29, 2023. In the last 28 months of my administration, like our founding fathers and leaders who came before me, I have committed myself irrevocably to the unfinished nation-building business. 7. Upon assuming office, our administration inherited a near-collapsed economy caused by decades of fiscal policy distortions and misalignment that had impaired real growth. As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform. We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit. 8. In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our Commonwealth. Our administration has redirected the economy towards a more inclusive path, channelling money to fund education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and critical economic infrastructure, such as roads, power, broadband, and social investment programmes. These initiatives will generally improve Nigerians' quality of life. As a result of the tough decisions we made, the Federal and State governments, including Local Governments, now have more resources to take care of the people at the lower level of the ladder, to address our development challenges. 9. Fellow Nigerians, we are racing against time. We must build the roads we need, repair the ones that have become decrepit, and construct the schools our children will attend and the hospitals that will care for our people. We have to plan for the generations that will come after us. We do not have enough electricity to power our industries and homes today, or the resources to repair our deteriorating roads, build seaports, railroads, and international airports comparable to the best in the world, because we failed to make the necessary investments decades ago. Our administration is setting things right. 10. I am pleased to report that we have finally turned the corner. The worst is over, I say. Yesterday's pains are giving way to relief. I salute your endurance, support, and understanding. I will continue to work for you and justify the confidence you reposed in me to steer the ship of our nation to a safe harbour. 11. Under our leadership, our economy is recovering fast, and the reforms we started over two years ago are delivering tangible results. The second quarter 2025 Gross Domestic Product grew by 4.23% -- Nigeria's fastest pace in four years -- and outpaced the 3.4 per cent projected by the International Monetary Fund. Inflation declined to 20.12% in August 2025, the lowest level in three years. The administration is working diligently to boost agricultural production and ensure food security, reducing food costs. 12. In the last two years of our administration, we have achieved 12 remarkable economic milestones as a result of the implementation of our sound fiscal and monetary policies: i. We have attained a record-breaking increase in non-oil revenue, achieving the 2025 target by August with over N20 trillion. In September 2025 alone, we raised N3.65 trillion, 411% higher than the amount raised in May 2023. ii. We have restored Fiscal Health: Our debt service-to-revenue ratio has been significantly reduced from 97% to below 50%. We have paid down the infamous ""Ways and Means"" advances that threatened our economic stability and triggered inflation. Following the removal of the corrupt petroleum subsidy, we have freed up trillions of Naira for targeted investment in the real economy and social programmes for the most vulnerable, as well as all tiers of government. iii. We have a stronger foreign Reserve position than three years ago. Our external reserves increased to $42.03 billion this September -- the highest since 2019. iv. Our tax-to-GDP ratio has risen to 13.5 per cent from less than 10 per cent. The ratio is expected to increase further when the new tax law takes effect in January. The tax law is not about increasing the burden on existing taxpayers but about expanding the base to build the Nigeria we deserve and providing tax relief to low-income earners. v. We are now a Net Exporter: Nigeria has recorded a trade surplus for five consecutive quarters. We are now selling more to the world than we are buying, a fundamental shift that strengthens our currency and creates jobs at home. Nigeria's trade surplus increased by 44.3% in Q2 2025 to ₦7.46 trillion ($4.74 billion), the largest in about three years. Goods manufactured in Nigeria and exported jumped by 173%. Non-oil exports, as a component of our export trade, now represent 48 per cent, compared to oil exports, which account Shirt Black DD1992 - The Nike Air Max 98 University Red Is This Seasons Must Cop Sneaker - FIT Men's T - Nike Pro Dri - 010 for 52 per cent. This signals that we are diversifying our economy and foreign exchange sources outside oil and gas. vi. Oil production rebounded to 1.68 million barrels per day from barely one million in May 2023. The increase occurred due to improved security, new investments, and better stakeholder management in the Niger Delta. Furthermore, the country has made notable advancements by refining PMS domestically for the first time in four decades. It has also established itself as the continent's leading exporter of aviation fuel. vii. The Naira has stabilised from the turbulence and volatility witnessed in 2023 and 2024. The gap between the official rate and the unofficial market has reduced substantially, following FX reforms and fresh capital and remittance inflows. The multiple exchange rates, which fostered corruption and arbitrage, are now part of history. Additionally, our currency rate against the dollar is no longer determined by fluctuations in crude oil prices. viii. Under the social investment programme to support poor households and vulnerable Nigerians, N330 billion has been disbursed to eight million households, many of whom have received either one or two out of the three tranches of N25,000 each. ix. Coal mining recovered dramatically from a 22% decline in Q1 to 57.5% growth in Q2, becoming one of Nigeria's fastest-growing sectors. The solid mineral sector is now pivotal in our economy, encouraging value-added production of minerals extracted from our soil. x. The administration is expanding transport infrastructure across the country, covering rail, roads, airports, and seaports. Rail and water transport grew by over 40% and 27%, respectively. The 284-kilometre Kano-Kastina-Maradi Standard Gauge rail project and the Kaduna-Kano rail line are nearing completion. Work is progressing well on the legacy Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and Sokoto-Badagry Highway. The Federal Executive Council recently approved $3 billion to complete the Eastern Rail Project. xi. The world is taking notice of our efforts. Sovereign credit rating agencies have upgraded their outlook for Nigeria, recognising our improved economic fundamentals. Our stock market is experiencing an unprecedented boom, rising from an all-share index of 55,000 points in May 2003 to 142,000 points as of September 26, 2025. xii. At its last MPC meeting, the Central Bank slashed interest rates for the first time in five years, expressing confidence in our country's macroeconomic stability. 13. We are working diligently to enhance national security, ensuring our economy experiences improved growth and performance. The officers and men of our armed forces and other security agencies are working tirelessly and making significant sacrifices to keep us safe. They are winning the war against terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes. We see their victories in their blood and sweat to stamp out Boko Haram Terror in North-East, IPOB/ESN terror in South East and banditry and kidnapping. We must continue to celebrate their gallantry and salute their courage on behalf of a grateful nation. Peace has returned to hundreds of our liberated communities in North-West and North-East, and thousands of our people have returned safely to their homes. 14. I have a message for our young people. You are the future and the greatest assets of this blessed country. You must continue to dream big, innovate, and conquer more territories in your various fields of science, technology, sports, and the art and creative sector. Our administration, through policies and funding, will continue to give you wings to fly sky-high. We created NELFUND to support students with loans for their educational pursuits. Approximately 510,000 students across 36 states and the FCT have benefited from this initiative, covering 228 higher institutions. As of September 10, the total loan disbursed was N99.5 billion, while the upkeep allowance stood at N44.7 billion. 15. Credicorp, another initiative of our administration, has granted 153,000 Nigerians N30 billion affordable loans for vehicles, solar energy, home upgrades, digital devices, and more. 16. YouthCred, which I promised last June, is a reality, with tens of thousands of NYSC members now active beneficiaries of consumer credit for resettlement. 17. Under our Renewed Hope Agenda, we promised to build a Nigeria where every young person, regardless of background, has an equitable opportunity to access a better future -- thus, the Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises (iDICE) programme. The Bank of Industry is driving the programme, in collaboration with the African Development Bank, the French travis scott air jordan 1 retro low og black olive release date fall 2024 Development Agency, and the Islamic Development Bank. This initiative is at the cusp of implementation. Over the last two years, we have collaborated with our partners to launch the programme, supporting our young builders and dreamers in the technology and creative sectors. 18. Fellow Nigerians, I have always candidly acknowledged that these reforms have come with some temporary pains. The biting effects of inflation and the rising cost of living remain a significant concern to our government. However, the alternative of allowing our country to descend into economic chaos or bankruptcy was not an option. Our macro-economic progress has proven that our sacrifices have not been in vain. Together, we are laying a new foundation cast in concrete, not on quicksand. 19. The accurate measure of our success will not be limited to economic statistics alone, but rather in the food on our families' tables, the quality of education our children receive, the electricity in our homes, and the security in our communities. Let me assure you of our administration's determination to ensure that the resources we have saved and the stability we have built are channelled into these critical areas. Today, the governors at the state level and local government autonomy are yielding more developments. 20. Therefore, on this 65th Anniversary of Our Independence, my message is hope and a call to action. The federal government will continue to do its part to fix the plumbing in our economy. Now, we must all turn on the taps of productivity, innovation, and enterprise, just like the Ministry of Interior has done with our travel passports, by quickening the processing. In this regard, I urge the sub-national entities to join us in nation-building. Let us be a nation of producers, not just consumers. Let us farm our land and build factories to process our produce. Let us patronise 'Made-in-Nigeria' goods. I say Nigeria first. Let us pay our taxes. 21. Finally, let all hands be on deck. Let us believe, once more, in the boundless potential of our great nation. 22. With Almighty God on our side, I can assure you that the dawn of a new, prosperous, self-reliant Nigeria is here. 23. Happy 65th Independence Anniversary, and may God continue to bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",OsunDefender,2025-10-01T10:23:40Z,https://osundefender.com/nigeria65-read-full-text-of-president-bola-tinubus-broadcast-to-nigerians/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.979994,0.4588235294117646

"Bursa ends higher, tracks regional gains","KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia ended higher today, tracking gains across most regional equity markets, an analyst said. Rakuten Trade vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) tracked regional markets, with most major Asian bourses finishing higher on strong gains in tech stocks amid optimism over the artificial intelligence trade. China and Hong Kong were closed for National Day, with mainland markets to remain shut until the middle of next week. Back home, Thong said the FBM KLCI has broken out of its rectangular consolidation pattern that persisted since mid-August, signalling renewed strength in the market. ""The decisive move above 1,600 has been followed by a steady climb, and the index is now testing the 1,620-1,625 resistance band. ""This zone represents a critical breakout level; a successful push beyond it would confirm the end of the consolidation phase and pave the way for a move toward the 1,635-1,650 range in the near term,"" he told Bernama. Meanwhile, IPPFA Sdn Bhd director of investment strategy and country economist Sedek Jantan said sentiment was also lifted by the latest S&P Malaysia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which reported a second straight month of rising new orders in September. While export demand softened across the US, Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific, the survey pointed to stronger domestic confidence and the launch of new projects as key growth drivers. ""The uptick in activity also placed pressure on operating capacity, ending more than a year of backlog reduction,"" said Sedek. He noted that the FBM KLCI currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.63 -broadly fair but still at a meaningful discount to the US market at 26.76, which is widely considered expensive. ""This valuation gap, combined with firmer domestic demand and upcoming policy catalysts such as Budget 2026, strengthens Malaysia's positioning as a beneficiary of near-term portfolio reallocation,"" he added. For September, the FBM KLCI gained 1.56%, reflecting steady accumulation despite global uncertainties. At 5pm, the FBM KLCI rose 8.99 points, or 0.55%, to 1,620.87, compared with yesterday's close of 1,611.88. The benchmark index opened 0.74 of-a-point higher at 1,612.62, and moved between 1,612.62 and 1,624.04 throughout the session.

"CHF: Intervention, pharma and the franc - ING","It's been quite a busy week for Swiss news. On Monday, the Swiss National Bank effectively increased the amount of CHF banking deposits exposed to a 0.25bp charge. The press release pitched that as a technical clean-up to last year's adjustment in minimum reserves. It doesn't look like a 'stealth' easing of monetary policy, but it's interesting to see what happens to Swiss money market rates when the measure goes into effect on 1 November. It is a downside risk to the franc, however, ING's FX analyst Chris Turner notes. ""Late Monday also brought a very rare joint statement from Swiss and US authorities on the use of FX intervention. The SNB statement marketed this as a kind of blessing to use FX intervention as part of its regular monetary policy activities. Whereas the US version of the statement merely focused on the use of intervention to address disorderly or volatile markets. That may be the reason why EUR/CHF has not traded much higher on the news. And these releases preceded data which showed SNB FX buying intervention had picked up a little to CHF5bn in the second quarter."" ""We speculate whether the FX intervention statement has something to do with the pharma deals President Trump is announcing this week. Presumably, Washington wants to get the Swiss drugmakers onside as he launches his new 'TrumpRx' website to deliver drugs at discounted rates to US consumers. Pfizer was the first of the big companies to sign up to this yesterday. If this read is right, then, yes, maybe Switzerland does have Washington's blessing for continued FX intervention and can avoid being labelled a currency manipulator.""",FXStreet,2025-10-01T09:16:13Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/chf-intervention-pharma-and-the-franc-ing-202510010916,2025-10-01 18:29:59.980745,0.1450980392156862

"Japan Airlines tightens liver function checks, suspends high-risk pilots after drinking incidents - VnExpress International","Japan Airlines said it will impose stricter safety measures, including suspending risky pilots whose liver functions deteriorate beyond acceptable levels, as it grapples with a spate of drinking incidents involving its pilots. The airline on Tuesday announced the measures, aimed at preventing similar incidents, after the Transport Ministry reprimanded and required it to do so. Six pilots have already been suspended from duty, as reported by Kyodo News. The carrier has been struggling with a series of cases where its pilots were caught drinking before flights despite an internal ban prohibiting captains from drinking at their destinations. In the most recent incident, a pilot consumed alcohol before a flight from Hawaii in late August, resulting in delays of up to 18 hours across three flights, as reported by the Japan Times. That captain was found to have drunk before flights on multiple occasions since the ban was put in place last December. He had also manipulated the date and time settings of the sobriety testing device. The airline has since dismissed the pilot and imposed pay cuts on its president and dozens of executives. The December ban was introduced after a string of similar alcohol-related issues, but incidents have persisted due to communication lapses within the company, according to Nikkei Asia. At Japan Airlines, pilots earn far more than their colleagues in other roles. The airline's securities filings show that pilots bring in an average of 20.05 million yen (US$135,000) a year, compared with 6.43 million yen for ground staff and 5.92 million yen for cabin crew. Some pilots say moderate drinking helps them relax after long-haul flights and amid the pressures of tight schedules as travel demand rises.

"Eurozone Preliminary HICP inflation rises to 2.2% YoY in September, as expected","The Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose at an annual rate of 2.2% in September, having reported a 2% growth in August, the official data released by Eurostat showed Wednesday. Markets forecast a 2.2% print. The core HICP advanced 2.3% year-over-year (YoY) in September, following a 2.3% increase in August while matching the 2.3% expected reading. On a monthly basis, the bloc's HICP inflation arrived at 0.1% in September, compared with August's 0.1%. The core HICP rose 0.1% month-over-month (MoM) in the same period after climbing 0.3% in August. The European Central Bank's (ECB) inflation target is 2.0%. The old continent's HICP inflation data significantly impacts the market's pricing of the ECB's future interest rate cuts. Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, services is expected to have the highest annual rate in September (3.2%, compared with 3.1% in August), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (3.0%, compared with 3.2% in August), non-energy industrial goods (0.8%, stable compared with August) and energy (-0.4%, compared with -2.0% in August). The Euro holds moderate gains after Eurozone inflation data, with EUR/USD adding 0.15% on the day to trade near 1.1750 as of writing. This section below was published at 07:29 GMT as a preview of the Eurozone preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices inflation data. The Eurostat will publish the preliminary Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for September later on Wednesday at 09:00 GMT. Eurozone HICP inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% year-over-year (YoY) in September, from 2.0% in August. Meanwhile, the annual core inflation is anticipated to remain consistent at 2.3% in the reported month. The monthly Eurozone inflation and core inflation were at 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, in August. The EUR/USD pair may receive support if Eurozone HICP data comes stronger-than-expected. The inflation and core inflation are both expected to come above the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2.0% YoY. The EUR/USD pair also appreciates as the US Dollar (USD) faces challenges after the latest US jobs data increased the odds of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. Traders are likely to await September's US ADP Employment Change and ISM Manufacturing PMI data later in the day, though their release could be disrupted by the government shutdown. The Euro (EUR) advanced against its peers after preliminary German Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released on Tuesday. The German Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, the European Central Bank's (ECB) preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.2% month-over-month, lifting the annual rate to 2.4% from 2.1%. Technically, the EUR/USD pair surges to near 1.1780 at the time of writing, extending its winning streak for the fourth successive session. The market bias has turned bullish as the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) moves above the 50 level. The EUR/USD pair could explore the region around 1.1918, the highest since June 2021, which was recorded on September 17. On the downside, the initial support lies at the nine-day EMA of 1.1743, followed by the 50-day EMA of 1.1688. Further declines would prompt the EUR/USD pair to test the two-month low of 1.1608.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T09:04:49Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/when-is-the-eurozone-prelim-hicp-inflation-and-how-could-it-affect-eur-usd-202510010729,2025-10-01 18:29:59.981589,0.2549019607843137
"Credit card fraud rising in Canada, application fraud falling: Equifax Canada report","TORONTO -- A new report says the second quarter of the year brought a sharp rise in credit card fraud. Equifax Canada says the rate of credit card fraud jumped to 0.75 per cent in Q2 compared with 0.44 per cent a year earlier. That means out of every 10,000 credit cards, about 75 are fraudulent compared with 44 last year. The consumer credit reporting agency says the spike came despite application fraud rates across Canada falling to their lowest point since the third quarter of 2022. Application fraud is when someone lies or uses stolen information on an application for credit, a loan or another financial service. Application fraud rates dropped to 0.56 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, down from 0.70 per cent in the previous quarter and 0.57 per cent a year ago.",BNN,2025-10-01T10:25:05Z,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/personal-finance/2025/10/01/credit-card-fraud-rising-in-canada-application-fraud-falling-equifax-canada-report/,2025-10-01 18:29:59.981698,-0.2941176470588235
From Fashion to Tech: How Coupons Are Transforming the Online Shopping Experience,"Online shopping has become a way of life. From ordering clothes to upgrading the latest gadgets, the digital marketplace gives shoppers more variety, convenience, and speed than ever before. Yet, there's one element that truly elevates the online experience -- coupons. Once considered a simple discount slip, coupons have evolved into a powerful tool that is transforming how people shop across industries, from fashion to technology. The Evolution of Online Shopping E-commerce has grown from small catalog websites into a global marketplace where consumers can buy anything with just a few clicks. With this growth came increased competition, and retailers needed ways to attract and retain buyers. Discounts and promotional offers became the go-to strategy. Over time, digital coupons emerged as a smarter, faster, and more efficient way to deliver savings, making them a permanent part of the modern shopping journey. Why Coupons Matter More Than Ever In today's economic climate, saving money is a priority for most households. Shoppers no longer view coupons as optional; they actively search for them before completing a purchase. Studies show that buyers feel more satisfied when they know they've secured a good deal, which creates a psychological boost often called the ""smart shopper effect."" Coupons not only reduce costs but also provide a sense of reward and empowerment, encouraging customers to return for future purchases. Fashion Meets Savings - Coupons in the Apparel Industry The fashion industry is fast-paced, with new trends appearing almost every season. For many, keeping up with style can be expensive. Coupons make it possible to shop trendy apparel without breaking the budget. Whether its seasonal collections, end-of-season clearances, or exclusive online-only deals, coupons have redefined how people approach fashion shopping. More than ever, buyers now plan their wardrobes around upcoming sales and discounts, turning fashion into a mix of personal style and smart savings. Beauty on a Budget - Makeup and Skincare Deals Beyond fashion, makeup and skincare have also become major beneficiaries of digital coupons. Cosmetic products are often premium-priced, especially new launches or branded items. Coupons allow beauty lovers to try new shades, skincare routines, or luxury products without overspending. Seasonal promotions, bundle offers, and online-exclusive deals make makeup shopping both fun and affordable, empowering shoppers to experiment with style while staying within budget. Tech on a Budget - Making Gadgets Affordable Technology is another sector heavily influenced by coupons. Smartphones, laptops, wearables, and other gadgets often come with premium price tags. For cost-conscious shoppers, coupons bridge the gap between desire and affordability. Many people now delay their tech purchases until a promotional offer or discount becomes available. This trend shows how powerful coupons are in shaping buying decisions, allowing more people to access innovations that once seemed out of reach. The New Shopping Experience - Convenience + Savings Digital coupons have transformed convenience. Instead of clipping paper vouchers, shoppers now enjoy instant codes and one-click discounts. Mobile coupons are especially popular, with buyers applying them directly at checkout on smartphones. Beyond cost savings, coupons create loyalty. A shopper who saves today is more likely to revisit the same store tomorrow. Real-time deals and personalized offers have made the shopping experience not only more affordable but also more enjoyable. Future of Coupons in E-Commerce The future points to even smarter coupon experiences. Artificial intelligence is paving the way for highly personalized discounts based on individual shopping behavior. Instead of generic offers, buyers will see promotions tailored to their exact preferences -- whether that's fashion, makeup, tech, or even BBQ grilling products. Additionally, coupons are being integrated into subscription services, loyalty programs, and digital wallets, making savings effortless. As sustainability gains importance, digital coupons also reduce paper waste, aligning with eco-friendly shopping habits. Conclusion From stylish wardrobes to beauty essentials, from BBQ grilling gear to cutting-edge gadgets, coupons are reshaping the online shopping experience. What once served as a simple discount has now become a driver of consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and smarter spending. The future of e-commerce is clear: shopping isn't just about buying anymore -- it's about buying better. With coupons leading the way, online shopping is becoming more affordable, personalized, and enjoyable than ever before.

World shares are mixed as a U.S. government shutdown adds to uncertainty,"U.S. futures sank and world shares were mixed after a U.S. government shutdown began on Wednesday. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.6%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Dow gained 0.2%, to set an all-time high. The Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher to 22,660.01. In early European trading, Germany's DAX lost 0.2% to 23,916.90 and the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 0.2% to 7,907.99. Britain's FTSE rose 0.7% to 9,416.30. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.9% to 44,550.85 after the Bank of Japan reported a slight improvement in business sentiment among major manufacturers. The indications from the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey raise the odds that the central bank will increase its key interest rate to counter inflation that has topped its target range of about 2% for some time. Political uncertainty is also looming over Japan's markets, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party due to chose a new leader and prime minister later this week to replace embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Markets and offices in mainland China are closed until Oct. 8 for the National Day holiday, China's central bank said it plans a 1.1 trillion yuan ($160 billion) reverse repo operation on Oct. 9, to increase the amount of cash in circulation and stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,455.83, while Taiwan's Taiex added 0.6% on heavy buying of semiconductor-related shares. Markets appeared to be taking the U.S. shutdown, which took effect at midnight U.S. Eastern time, in stride. Past U.S. government shutdowns have had a limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. This shutdown could be different, with the White House prone to push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs won't derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Tuesday brought mixed reports on the U.S. economy. A Conference Board survey showed consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ""low-hire, low-fire"" state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that's neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, since a government shutdown would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday's on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. The Department of Labor has said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there's a lapse. The agency already was strained by Trump's firing of Erika McEntarfer as BLS commissioner on Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed a rapid slowdown in hiring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Late Tuesday, the White House said Trump was withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the bureau, according to an AP source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a White House action that hadn't been publicly announced. Oil prices fell back early Wednesday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil shedding 21 cents to $62.16 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 22 cents to $65.80 per barrel.

Minister Dion George on rural and coastal economies leading South Africa's growth,"The Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Dr Dion George, has underlined the importance of forestry and fisheries as engines of rural and coastal development that contribute directly to national growth. ""Forestry and fisheries are not small side industries. They are pillars of our economy, supporting families, creating work, and driving transformation in places often left out of the growth story,"" Minister George said. He explained that the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors grew strongly in late 2024 and early 2025, contributing significantly to national GDP at a time when other sectors were under pressure. The Commercial Forestry Master Plan, adopted in 2019, is being implemented as a blueprint for inclusive growth. By transferring state plantations to communities, the Department is enabling transformation and building jobs in timber production and processing industries. On the fisheries side, the Department has recognised approximately 10 000 small-scale fishers, organised into 171 cooperatives across four provinces. With support in co-management structures, abalone ranching, and mentorship, these cooperatives are accessing resources that improve incomes and resilience. The Minister said that the Fishing for Freedom campaign is revitalising harbours as hubs of economic activity. These sites are being transformed to support fish processing, boat repair, tourism, and hospitality, ensuring that fishing towns become integrated centres of growth. ""Every cooperative supported and every harbour revitalised is proof that environmental stewardship is not in conflict with jobs. It is the foundation of jobs,"" the Minister said. He emphasised that forestry and fisheries show how green industries can spread prosperity to rural and coastal areas, while safeguarding resources for future generations. ""By planting trees, empowering cooperatives, and revitalising harbours, we are showing that rural and coastal economies are not waiting at the margins. They are leading South Africa's growth story,"" Minister George concluded.",South African Government,2025-10-01T07:37:25Z,https://www.gov.za/news/media-statements/minister-dion-george-rural-and-coastal-economies-leading-south-africa%E2%80%99s,2025-10-01 18:29:59.983045,0.3803921568627451
Asahi suffers cyber-attack,"Japanese brewer Asahi is currently experiencing a ""system failure"" as a result of a cyber-attack impacting shipping and customer service operations in Japan. Asahi is the latest business to be attacked by online hackers. In recent months, other major companies including Jaguar Land Rover and UK retailers Marks & Spencer and Co-op have also suffered system breaches. The Japanese brewer announced the system failure in a statement released on Monday (29 September). It said there had been ""no confirmed leakage of personal information or customer data to external parties"". However, order and shipment operations at group companies in Japan have been suspended, as have call centre operations and customer service desks while the company deals with the attack. Asahi's European operations, including the UK, were not affected. The brewer said in a statement: ""We are actively investigating the cause and working to restore operations; however, there is currently no estimated timeline for recovery. The system failure is limited to our operations within Japan. ""We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers and business partners."" Asahi warned that a cyber-attack was among the main risks it faced as a company in the medium to short term in a report released last year. The company said at the time that it was assessing the maintenance of its security system in order to reduce the risk, predicting that an attack would lead to disruptions in business, create cashflow issues and damage the brand. It is unclear whether its efforts to increase online security have mitigated the impact of the recent cyber-attack. Asahi is Japan's biggest brewer and owns global beer brands Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. In the UK, Asahi owns west London's Fullers brewery, which produces London Pride, Cornish Orchard and Dark Star.

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",Yahoo,2025-10-01T10:13:02Z,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-fourth-101302725.html,2025-10-01 18:30:02.405424,-0.05882352941176472
100% tariff on foreign films: Will Trump's move hit Indian Cinema? Here's all you need to know - The Times of India,"Representative AI image President Donald Trump's move to impose a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States is expected to severely dent revenues of Indian films in the American market, according to industry experts.Earlier announcing the measure on social media, Trump claimed that ""America's movie business has been stolen by other countries"" and compared it to ""stealing candy from a baby."" He said the new tariff would address what he called a ""never-ending problem"" facing Hollywood.The decision, however, poses significant challenges in implementation given the global and borderless nature of the film business. Still, for India, the world's largest film-producing nation - the impact could be substantial. The US accounts for 40-60% of the overseas earnings of Hindi films, driven largely by the Indian diaspora.Distributors may have to hike ticket prices in the US to offset the tariff, a move that could reduce footfalls and squeeze their revenue share, industry insiders warned.""To the best of my knowledge, Hollywood derives 60% of its revenues from the rest of the world. This shows the irony of the situation. I think this tariff is likely to impact the last mile consumer a lot,"" Pranab Kapadia, director at overseas distribution firm Moviegoers Entertainment told ET.""The impact of tariff is high ticket prices, which will lower the revenue share of distributors of Indian films, thereby hurting the overall box office potential of Indian films,"" he added.Kapadia, who is known for distributing films from Karan Johar's Dharma Productions overseas, pointed out that Hindi films derive 40-60% of their total overseas earnings from the US market. This year's biggest blockbuster Saiyaara collected over $6 million (Rs 53 crore) in North America alone, making it the third-highest-grossing Indian film in the US.Distributors warn that the short theatrical window before films move to streaming platforms could make audiences reluctant to pay higher ticket prices. ""Today, there is such a short window between a film which gets released in theatres and then its showcasing on streaming platforms. In this context, a tariff of 100% makes it even more challenging for distributors to bring footfalls in theatres, especially when they must resort to hiking ticket prices to compensate for the tariff,"" ET reported quoting a veteran distributor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Industry insiders fear mid- and small-budget films may skip theatrical releases in the US altogether, opting for direct-to-OTT launches. Larger tentpole films may still release but with higher ticket prices and lower margins.""A 100% tariff could wipe out 40% of Indian films' US revenues, but the deeper worry is the audience fallout. With ticket prices soaring to $20, many diaspora families may abandon theatres,"" the outlet reported quoting Suniel Wadhwa, cofounder and director of Karmic Films.""This is not just a tariff. It is a cultural barrier. Cinema is India's strongest soft power export to the world,"" he added.While producers are still assessing the long-term impact, many believe the move will force a recalibration of film distribution and marketing strategies for the American market.With an Indian diaspora of 5.2 million in the US and revenues tied to the dollar, the American box office remains a vital market for Bollywood. But industry voices agree: Trump's tariff could redraw the economics of Indian cinema abroad.

"Ethereum price prediction: Can ETH break $4,600 and target $5K?","The short-term view ranges from neutral to cautiously bullish, depending on ETH's ability to retake resistance. Ethereum price prediction is in sharp focus as the coin trades near $4,140, holding steady after a turbulent September. The $4,600 zone is shaping up as a crucial resistance level for bulls, while the $4,000-$4,200 range remains an important cushion of support. Traders are discussing whether Ethereum's current steadiness provides a foundation for another upward push, or if the lack of momentum could lead to additional downside pressure. Institutional ETF flows and consistent staking activity remain closely watched as potential catalysts. Ethereum has entered a consolidation phase between $4,000 and $4,400, indicating a period of lower volatility than the rapid intraday changes observed last week. Lighter volumes indicate a brief pause in market activity as traders await stronger signals. Despite this, underlying network activity remains strong, with DeFi protocols continuing to secure significant liquidity, bolstering Ethereum's foundations. Institutional flows have also played a stabilizing role. Spot ETH ETFs have seen inflows on numerous important days, indicating a gradual but consistent build-up in long-term demand. While speculative impetus has slowed, increased participation from funds and continuous staking activity are helping Ethereum (ETH) avoid deeper retracements, keeping price movement constructive within its current range. A solid advance above $4,400-$4,500 would likely start Ethereum on a path to higher objectives, initially around $4,800-$5,000. This level has served as resistance in recent weeks, and regaining it could result in short covering in derivatives markets, accelerating upward momentum. Traders see ETF inflows as a catalyst that might propel Ethereum into its next bullish leg. From a broader Ethereum coin forecast, analysts note that momentum could extend into Q4, with some calling for a push beyond $5,200. The expectation is that if staking elements are integrated into ETF products, available supply would shrink further, potentially drawing more institutional allocations and fueling a longer-term rally. The greatest danger is Ethereum's inability to defend its $4,200 support zone. Derivatives heatmaps reveal thick liquidation clusters in this range, implying that a sudden drop could intensify selling pressure toward $4,000. Such a scenario is most likely caused by low liquidity and the unwinding of leveraged long bets. Macroeconomic conditions add another layer of uncertainty. Political developments, shifting interest rate projections, or sudden ETF redemption waves could stall momentum and leave ETH vulnerable. Even with solid fundamentals, a risk-off backdrop could quickly cap upside moves. Ethereum's short-term direction is mainly dependent on whether it can maintain a price over $4,400-$4,500. A confirmed breach above this resistance area would support a bullish forecast of $4,800-$5,000, with a probability of reaching $5,200 if institutional flows stay supportive. Traders believe this scenario is increasingly plausible if ETF inflows continue at their current rate. Conversely, a decisive drop below $4,200 would shift sentiment bearish, opening the door to a slide below $4,000. Such a move would likely trigger liquidations and dampen near-term confidence. For now, the Ethereum outlook remains neutral to cautiously bullish, with the balance of expectation resting on its ability to reclaim resistance.",crypto.news,2025-10-01T10:17:13Z,https://crypto.news/ethereum-price-prediction-eth-5k-target/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.406880,0.1372549019607843

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA(AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",WHAS 11 Louisville,2025-10-01T10:12:32Z,https://www.whas11.com/article/syndication/associatedpress/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-this-year-the-fourth-biggest-retreat-on-record-experts-say/616-f01841d2-0976-4c5f-a898-8351395c4f66,2025-10-01 18:30:02.407829,-0.05882352941176472

"Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals, research finds","More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Nottingham Post,2025-10-01T10:24:52Z,https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-10540582,2025-10-01 18:30:02.409052,-0.1607843137254902
"DXY: ADP, ISM Manufacturing today - OCBC","US Dollar (USD) traded a touch softer overnight in amid concerns of US government shutdown. DXY last seen at 97.62 levels. BLS has already confirmed that it will delay the release of the jobs report (due on Fri) if the US government shutdown occurs, OCBC's FX analysts Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong note. ""This puts greater emphasis on Fedspeaks and other data releases, including ADP employment, ISM manufacturing today. Softer print is likely to weigh on USD. Proxy play may likely include long gold, JPY; short USD if the shutdown persists for longer, in turn affecting risk appetite or even economic activities. Elsewhere on the latest round of sectoral tariffs, Fed's Goolsbee said the most recent round of tariffs may be causing businesses in his district to again pause decision-making in order to see where the levies settle. "" ""Daily momentum is mild bullish while RSI shows tentative signs of turning higher. Resistance at 98.40/60 levels (100 DMA, 38.2% fibo retracement of May high to Sep low), 99 levels (50% fibo). Support at 97.60 (21 DMA, 23.6% fibo), 97.20 levels. On Fedspeaks overnight, Logan indicated that Fed should proceed cautiously on further rate cuts and there may be little room for more rate cuts. Susan Collins said further interest-rate reductions may be appropriate in 2025 given a weaker labor market, but officials need to remain on guard against the possibility of persistent inflation."" ""This is consistent with the cautious remarks made by other Fed officials. Last week, Goolsbee said that he could be less willing to support 'overly frontloading a lot of rate cuts' on the presumption that inflation will just be transitory and go away as many midwest businesses are still concerned that inflation was not under control.

Ariadne's string goes electric: a new interconnection between Crete and mainland Greece drives the energy transition | EnergyTransition.org,"The electrical interconnection between Crete and mainland Greece was completed and has been in operation since May 2025. The completion of this infrastructure project is a big step in Greece's energy transition. Connecting the island of Crete with the mainland allows the country to finally tap into the abundant wind and solar energy potential on Crete and to switch off old and polluting power plants. At the same time, the Ariadne interconnection builds the foundation for advancing green energy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Daniel Argyropoulos reports. In Greek mythology, Ariadne, daughter of the Cretan king Minos, gave Theseus a sword, so he could fight against the Minotaur, and a long, rolled-up string. Theseus went off to Crete and killed the Minotaur hidden in a labyrinth. After defeating the beast, Theseus used the string to find his way out of the labyrinth. Ever since, Ariadne's string has been a metaphor for finding a way out of a difficult situation. Ariadne's string, in modern times, is not made out of wool but out of copper, and spans the Aegean Sea over a length of 335 kilometres. The Ariadne interconnection is a new power transmission line that connects Attica on mainland Greece and the island of Crete. It was completed at the end of 2024 after three years of construction and has been in operation since the end of May 2025. Building the interconnection was technically complex and challenging. Two cables had to be placed at depths of up to 1,200 metres into the rocky seabed of the Aegean Sea. According to the developing company, it is one of the deepest interconnections worldwide. When in full operation, it will be able to transmit 1,000 MW of electrical power, enough to cover the energy needs of the whole island during most of the year. The Ariadne interconnection, in addition to a smaller interconnection between Crete and the Peloponnese completed in 2022, is a major milestone in the energy transition of Greece. Up until recently, the electrical system of Crete was isolated, meaning that all energy used by the 650,000 inhabitants of Crete and the roughly 5 million tourists visiting the island every year had to be generated on the island. A large part thereof is still produced from old and inefficient power plants burning heavy oil and diesel. This not only leads to high CO emissions but also to very high generation costs. These costs are passed on to all electricity consumers in Greece through a Public Service Obligation (PSO), which is set by the government and is part of the utility bill. As consumers on the non-interconnected islands (NII) are not charged higher tariffs than consumers on the mainland, the PSO is used to subsidise the much higher production costs in the islands. The total amount collected through the PSO is around €600-700 million per year. At the household level, the PSO typically accounts for 4-8% of a typical household's electricity bill, depending on the amount of electricity consumed. In Crete's isolated electrical system, there was only little space for renewable energies, despite the impressive solar and wind potential. Renewable energy, in theory, could supply a large share of the energy needed on the island. But as wind and solar are variable sources of energy by their nature, their integration is tricky in an isolated electricity grid. Flexible back-up generation is necessary to meet demand for energy when there is little wind or sun. The existing stock of old power plants was only able to do this to a limited extent. As a consequence of this technical limitation, as of today, the share of renewable energy in the electricity supply of Crete is limited to 20%, with the remaining 80% being produced from fossil fuel. In comparison, the share of electricity produced from wind energy, solar PV and hydropower in the entire country had already reached 50% in 2024, up from about 20% in 2015, mainly due to the strong development of wind energy and solar PV in recent years. Connecting Crete with the much larger mainland electricity system finally ends the stalemate. Back-up capacity is no longer needed on the island as flexible power plants on mainland Greece can cover the demand in the future. With the interconnection in operation, the old power plants can be gradually shut down, reducing the carbon footprint of Crete by up to 500,000 tonnes of CO annually, as calculated by the developing company. Also, the country's consumers are expected to collectively save millions of euros every year as a significant share of the PSO is allocated to Crete. In 2020, Crete, as the largest island, accounted for about 20% of the total power consumption among the NIIs. When all old power plants are shut down, the savings from avoided PSO payments will amount to €100-150 million per year. At the same time, the use of wind and solar PV can be ramped up, providing clean and much cheaper energy to the island, and even mainland Greece. Connecting islands to the grid is costly and might not be economically viable in the case of islands with a much smaller population. Many of these isolated islands exist in the Aegean Sea and elsewhere. In these cases, other options to integrate renewable energy are being explored and increasingly implemented. The use of battery storage, in particular, is becoming more and more cost efficient. This has led to the implementation of hybrid systems consisting of solar PV and wind turbines combined with battery storage. These hybrid systems, which have been implemented on several remote islands, are able to replace a large part of the power produced from diesel generators. An interconnection between Greece, Cyprus and potentially Israel has been discussed for many years, and political agreements were signed by Greece and Cyprus. However, the project has not advanced so far. The successful completion of the Ariadne interconnection could create new momentum to the project known as the Mediterranean Interconnector. Extending the connection to Cyprus would help Cyprus to secure its energy supply and to dramatically lower its carbon footprint as the dependency on fossils fuels, all of which have to be imported, is even higher than on Crete. The modern version of Ariadne's string has helped to find a way to open up a green energy future for Crete. It can be hoped that the idea of Ariadne's mythical string is extended to a web that helps connect those islands still isolated today.",Energy Transition,2025-10-01T10:24:28Z,https://energytransition.org/2025/09/ariadnes-string-goes-electric-a-new-interconnection-between-crete-and-mainland-greece-drives-the-energy-transition/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.411494,-0.1058823529411764

"Azerbaijan, Italy: strategic economic bond forged by history and energy","The economic relationship between Azerbaijan and Italy is not just a tale of trade figures and energy pipelines -- it is a story of historical depth, strategic foresight, and mutual trust. These two nations, separated by geography but united by centuries of cultural and commercial exchange, have built a partnership that now stands as one of the most dynamic and forward-looking in the Euro-Caucasus region. Historically, the Azerbaijani and Italian peoples have maintained close ties, dating back hundreds of years. From the days of the Silk Road to the Renaissance, trade and cultural exchanges flourished between East and West. It is this legacy of connectivity that laid the foundation for modern cooperation. When Azerbaijan declared independence in the early 1990s, Italy was among the first European countries to recognize its sovereignty -- a gesture that signaled the beginning of a new era in bilateral relations. Over the past three decades, this partnership has evolved into a robust economic alliance. Italy has consistently ranked among Azerbaijan's top trading partners, and in 2025, the relationship reached new heights. In the first eight months of the year, trade turnover between the two countries hit $8.3 billion, accounting for nearly a quarter of Azerbaijan's total foreign trade. This figure is not just impressive -- it is indicative of a deep and diversified economic engagement. At the heart of this relationship lies energy. Italy is the largest importer of Azerbaijani oil and the second-largest recipient of its natural gas. The Southern Gas Corridor, and particularly the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), has become a strategic lifeline for Europe's energy security, with Italy serving as a key entry point for Azerbaijani gas. This infrastructure not only strengthens bilateral ties but also positions Azerbaijan as a reliable energy supplier to the broader European market. Yet, the partnership is not confined to hydrocarbons. Azerbaijan is actively pursuing economic diversification, and Italy has emerged as a vital collaborator in this effort. One of the most promising areas of cooperation is renewable energy. Azerbaijan has set an ambitious goal to export 4 gigawatts of green energy to Europe by 2040. This vision is backed by concrete agreements with European countries, including plans to transmit electricity via underwater cables across the Black Sea. Moreover, Azerbaijan is working with Central Asian nations to facilitate the export of their renewable energy through its territory, transforming the country into both an energy hub and a transit corridor. This shift toward green energy is not merely a strategic pivot -- it is a reflection of Azerbaijan's commitment to sustainability and innovation. Italian companies, known for their technological expertise and environmental leadership, are well-positioned to support this transition. Already, Italian firms are involved in key infrastructure projects in Azerbaijan, including the development of power stations and the modernization of energy grids. Beyond energy, the Azerbaijan-Italy partnership extends into infrastructure, manufacturing, education, and culture. Joint ventures and investment initiatives are growing, with Italian businesses increasingly viewing Azerbaijan as a gateway to the wider Caspian region. Educational exchanges and cultural collaborations further enrich the relationship, fostering mutual understanding and people-to-people connections. Diplomatically, the two countries have maintained a steady and constructive dialogue. High-level visits, strategic agreements, and shared positions on regional issues have reinforced the sense of partnership. Italy's support for Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and its active role in EU-Azerbaijan relations underscore the depth of political alignment. Looking ahead, the potential for further cooperation is immense. As Azerbaijan continues to modernize its economy and expand its global footprint, Italy remains a trusted partner with the capacity and willingness to contribute. From smart cities to digital transformation, from agribusiness to tourism, the opportunities are vast and varied. In a world facing complex challenges -- from energy transitions to geopolitical tensions -- the Azerbaijan-Italy economic relationship offers a model of resilience and strategic clarity.

"India central bank allows banks to fund acquisitions, lend more for IPOs | Company Business News","By Gopika Gopakumar, Khushi Malhotra and Ashwin Manikandan MUMBAI (Reuters) -India's central bank on Wednesday said that banks will be allowed to fund acquisitions while raising the amount of credit that individuals can take to to initial public offerings, as part of 22 measures announced to boost bank lending in the world's fifth-largest economy. The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank and its banking regulator, said rules for loans to large corporate groups will also be eased. India is expected to remain one of the fastest growing major economies, with the central bank forecasting growth of 6.8% in the current fiscal year. Central bank governor Sanjay Malhotra has previously said that growth is strong but below ""aspirations"" of near 8%. Bank loan growth has been slow despite a strong economy, expanding 10% over a year ago as of September 5, 2025. ""We want to ensure we are not in any way impeding growth, productive needs of the economy,"" RBI chief Malhotra said at a press conference. But these measures should not be seen as taking away from financial stability, he said. The Nifty private bank index rose 1.97% while banks and financials advanced 1.3% and 1.38% in Mumbai. ACQUISITIONS, EQUITY FINANCING The announced changes allow domestic banks to lend for acquisitions by Indian corporates, a segment so far cornered by foreign lenders and credit funds. The RBI permitted unfettered bank lending against listed debt securities and raised the limit for lending against equity shares from 2 million rupees ($22,554) to 20 million rupees. The cap on bank financing for IPOs will also be raised to 2.5 million rupees from 1 million rupees per individual. The decisions mark a step in deepening the role of banks in capital market activity, Anil Gupta, senior vice president at rating agency ICRA said. Alongside, the central bank proposed to withdraw a 2016 framework that limited bank lending to large corporations in a bid to reduce the risk of concentrated loan exposure. This change will allow banks to raise lending to big companies. The RBI lowered the risk weights for infrastructure loans by non-bank lenders, allowing greater credit flow to the ongoing build-out of roads and bridges across the country. ""While these measures are good for credit growth in longer run, near-term credit growth is constrained by weak demand,"" Suresh Ganapathy, analyst at Macquarie Research said. CAPITAL RULES Giving banks a breather on capital, the RBI said the implementation of so-called expected credit loss rules, which mandate banks to set aside more funds for potential bad loans, will be effective on April 1, 2027. While a draft framework on the rules had been published to bring Indian norms in line with global ones, an implementation date had not been announced. Banks will be given time till March 31, 2031 to fully implement that framework, RBI governor Malhotra said. Meanwhile the central bank proposed to make Basel 3 norms effective for banks from April 1, 2027. The RBI will also issue draft rules for credit risk shortly. The rules are expected to lower risk weights on certain segments to ease capital requirements for small enterprises and residential real estate, including home loans.

There are now reports that it may go with three monthly supply hikes of around 500k b/d each. If true, this will increase the scale of the surplus through the fourth quarter of this year and next year. The market should get more clarity on 5 October, when the group decides on output levels for November."" ""Numbers overnight from the American Petroleum Institute were somewhat supportive for crude oil and bearish for refined products.

SIBUR offsets carbon footprint of client event in Istanbul - Newspatrolling.com,"MOSCOW, RUSSIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 1 October 2025 - SIBUR offset the carbon footprint of a roundtable discussion held on 26 September 2025 for the company's international partners in Istanbul. The event was certified carbon neutral by an international verifier. The event's carbon footprint amounted to 45 metric tons of CО2 equivalent, or 45 carbon units. The carbon footprint was offset using SIBUR's carbon credits earned through an international climate project implemented at the ZapSibNeftekhim production site. Independent verification of the project's carbon neutrality was performed by TÜV AUSTRIA Standards & Compliance, an international company specializing in environmental and climate assessments, certifications and verifications. ""ISO 14021:2016/Amd 1:2021"" served as the evaluation standard. ""We've had experience assessing the carbon footprint of events before, but previously, this involved large-scale projects with numerous participants and sponsors. Therefore, it's especially significant that SIBUR applies the same responsible approach to its internal events. Most importantly, the company takes a systematic approach: initially selecting an environmentally friendly site and minimizing waste generation, and only then offsetting the inevitable carbon footprint. This approach, which prioritizes impact prevention over compensation, is fully consistent with the 'start with yourself' principle. It clearly demonstrates that every action matters, regardless of its scale. This concept is universal and can be applied by both large corporations and individuals for events of any size,"" said Svetlana Kleeva, Head of Climate and Low-Carbon Economy Services at TÜV AUSTRIA Standards and Compliance. ""Integrating climate considerations into business events isn't just about following global trends; it's a conscious contribution to preserving the environment for future generations. We highly value the opportunity to collaborate with partners who share our principles of sustainable development, and we're proud that SIBUR's climate projects contribute to the carbon neutrality of significant international initiatives,"" noted Nadezhda Galaktionova, SIBUR's Director of Sustainable Development. To date, SIBUR has implemented nine climate projects at its production sites, with a combined impact estimated at 10.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent over a 10-year period. The company's climate project portfolio is highly diversified and includes reforestation and afforestation initiatives, as well as technology and alternative energy projects. A portion of its verified carbon credits have been transferred to partners through various carbon market mechanisms, such as exchange and over-the-counter transactions, including using blockchain technology. SIBUR is one of the most dynamically developing companies in the global petrochemicals industry and a Russian leader in polymers and rubbers. The company produces in-demand products for society and uses advanced technologies to create new opportunities, investing in social infrastructure to improve people's quality of life. SIBUR develops through partnerships and an exchange of experience, continuous growth, a determination to strive towards ambitious goals, and a commitment to sustainable development principles. Its unique vertically integrated business model allows SIBUR to create highly competitive products that are used in many economic sectors worldwide: construction, food processing, medicine and pharmaceuticals, agriculture, automotive manufacturing, and others.

ISOSET Celebrates Historic Educational Breakthrough As 9-Year-Old Girl Passes French Baccalauréat,"Paris, France - is pleased to announce that a 9-year-old girl has successfully passed the French baccalauréat, earning a perfect 20/20 score on her oral exam. This record-breaking achievement, made possible through ISOSET's pioneering methodology, not only highlights the organization's commitment to transforming education but also reflects a broader pattern of exceptional outcomes. Over the past decade, ISOSET has consistently guided students to remarkable milestones, including children as early as 12 and 14, teenagers completing multiple master's degrees before turning 16, and a student defending a PhD at just 17 years old. Currently, two doctoral theses are being pursued by students aged 16 and 18, further underscoring the method's lasting impact and reliability. Central to this success is ISOSET's philosophy of limiting academic study to a maximum of two hours per day. By maintaining a balance between rigorous academics, social engagement, leisure, and artistic or athletic pursuits, ISOSET fosters well-rounded development. According to family members of the recent 9-year-old graduate, the approach prevents stress while encouraging confidence, resilience, and public-speaking skills far beyond their years. ""At that age, they don't even know what stress is,"" shared one relative, emphasizing how the program creates not only top-performing students but also happy and grounded children. Beyond early achievement, ISOSET has expanded its reach across three major domains: youth education programs designed around its accelerated learning methods, public IT training described by participants as ""life-changing career accelerators,"" and professional corporate training in areas such as information systems and project management. Each branch adheres to ISOSET's core values of efficiency, personalized pedagogy, and close mentorship. Despite growing international attention and offers to expand abroad, ISOSET remains firmly rooted in France. This decision underscores its commitment to establishing a world-class educational model that continues to inspire students of all ages, from early learners to adult professionals seeking career transformation. ""Education should never be reduced to hours of pressure and repetition,"" said Hugo Sbai of ISOSET. ""Our results show that children and adults alike can thrive academically and personally when balance and innovation are at the heart of learning."" Founded 17 years ago in Paris, ISOSET has become a leader in innovative education and professional training. The organization blends academic rigor with personalized teaching and life balance, helping children achieve extraordinary milestones while also equipping adults with transformative career skills.

Portmeirion slams government in energy bill row - as U.S. import tariffs hit too - Stoke-on-Trent Live,"Pottery giant Portmeirion has slammed the government over its lack of support for the beleaguered ceramics industry. The Stoke firm is already being battered by soaring energy costs - as well as U.S. import tariffs. It comes as Portmeirion has reported increased pre-tax losses from £2 million to £2.8 million in the first half of 2025 - but group sales have increased from £36.6 million to £37.1 million. Portmeirion has already pledged to increase production at its Stoke plant. Its chief executive Mike Raybould said: ""As we reported in our July trading statement, the introduction of additional import tariffs in the U.S. market caused immediate disruption and significant uncertainty in our largest and most profitable market. We have acted quickly and proactively in our response and continue to monitor the situation closely including how it impacts consumer confidence over the Christmas period. Against this backdrop I'm delighted that we have taken the opportunity to accelerate our Made in Stoke-on-Trent onshoring initiative, increasing the proportion of product supplied into the U.S. that is made in the UK. ""Outside of the U.S., we are pleased to see sales up 10.8% on a constant currency basis with an encouraging performance in our South Korea market. We anticipate growth in these markets to continue in the second half. ""We are in the early stages of following through on our transformation plan launched in March and despite the ongoing global market uncertainty, I am pleased with the progress being achieved. We are making decisions every day that we believe over time will strengthen our business and deliver more consistent and profitable results for our stakeholders. ""We will continue to execute on our own transformation plan, but we are disappointed that the UK Government has chosen not to take more immediate steps to support UK ceramic manufacturing and respond to the calls for action. It's been an extremely challenging few years for the industry with soaring energy prices and wider cost pressures. Targeted support to ensure a level playing field on energy costs with the rest of the world would be invaluable for the British ceramics industry, allowing its globally respected brands to compete more effectively at home and to further grow export markets thus supporting UK jobs.""",The Sentinel,2025-10-01T10:16:08Z,https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/portmeirion-slams-government-energy-bill-10540845,2025-10-01 18:30:02.416220,0.388235294117647

Judge dismisses Arm's last legal claim against Qualcomm,"Qualcomm is claiming complete victory over Arm in their licensing spat, after a court in Delaware ruled it has not breached the terms of any architecture license agreement (ALA) with the chip designer. This latest verdict [PDF] follows the court case at the end of last year, when a jury found largely in favor of the California chipmaker. This legal row concerned whether Qualcomm had broken the terms of its licenses with Arm when it acquired Nuvia, a startup developing Arm-based processors for the datacenter, and incorporated its technology into Qualcomm chips. In those hearings, the jury was unable to reach a consensus on whether Nuvia had breached its own ALA with Arm. The final ruling this week by District Judge Maryellen Noreika finds in favor of Nuvia and Qualcomm, that Nuvia did not in fact breach its ALA with the UK-based chip designer. This means that for the three issues raised in the December trial, the court has come down on the side of Qualcomm's in each case. As detailed previously, these were: ""With the Court's decision today, Qualcomm and its subsidiary Nuvia have achieved a full victory,"" said Qualcomm's General Counsel & Corporate Secretary Ann Chaplin. ""This decision follows Qualcomm's December 2024 jury trial win and is a full and final judgment in Qualcomm's favor. Our right to innovate prevailed in this case and we hope Arm will return to fair and competitive practices in dealing with the Arm ecosystem,"" she added. However, Arm indicated that it intends to appeal against the verdict. ""Arm remains confident in its position in its ongoing dispute with Qualcomm and will immediately file an appeal seeking to overturn the judgment,"" the company said in a statement sent to The Register. This would seem to be at odds with Qualcomm's view of things, as its CEO Cristiano Amon told a conference call for investors earlier this year that Arm ""has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm Architecture License Agreement."" The crux of this legal battle centered on whether Qualcomm had the right to use Nuvia's technology after acquiring the company, despite Qualy already having licenses of its own. Arm took the view that the licenses it had granted to Nuvia to design its own Arm-based chips could not simply be transferred to Qualcomm without its permission, and this would breach the license terms. The Brit-based biz claimed Qualcomm had not obtained consent or a new licensing agreement, despite lengthy negotiations, but had pushed ahead with incorporating Nuvia technology into its chips, such as the Snapdragon X Elite used in laptops. For its part, Qualcomm alleged Arm's lawsuit was ""payback"" for its earlier opposition to Nvidia's bid to buy the UK chip designer, which ultimately failed. It has also claimed Arm is aiming to produce its own datacenter processors, and sought to nobble Qualcomm as a potential rival in this market. Neil Shah, Research VP at Counterpoint Research, said this court ruling is ""monumental for Qualcomm,"" clearing the way for it to accelerate deployment of custom Nuvia-based CPU cores across a much broader spectrum of applications from PCs, smartphones, and automotive to high-performance computing domains like AI servers. ""While Arm's decision to pursue legal action was an understandable measure to protect its business, it was an unfortunate necessity that strained its relationship with a premier customer and partner,"" he said. ""Moving forward, it is imperative for Arm to seize this opportunity to mend fences and rebuild trust with Qualcomm,"" Shahn added, as it is a critical player in the Arm market. Qualcomm's counter lawsuit against Arm for breach of contract and improper interference, which it filed [PDF] in April 2024, is still ongoing, with a trial expected in March 2026, so this entire saga is not over just yet. ®",TheRegister.com,2025-10-01T10:20:59Z,https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/arms_last_legal_claim_against/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.416950,0.2627450980392156

"Russian shadow fleet: ship detained in Baltic Sea, now in France - Baltic News Network","French authorities are investigating a ship linked to the Russian shadow fleet, which was also detained in the Baltic Sea this year, ERR News reports. The Benin-flagged oil tanker Boracay is on the list of sanctions against Russia by the UK and the European Union. It previously used the name Kiwala and was detained by Estonian authorities on the 11th of April. The French navy said in a statement that a report had been filed with the Brest prosecutor's office about alleged violations by the Boracay, and an investigation was underway. It was launched after the crew failed to provide evidence of the ship's flag and did not follow orders. According to the ship traffic monitoring website MarineTraffic, the ship left the port of Primorsk in Russia on the 20th of September and sailed from the Baltic Sea through the Danish Strait to the North Sea and then to the Lamas Strait. There have been suggestions that the ship was in the Danish Strait at a time when it could have served as a launch site for drones, which caused air traffic to be suspended at several Danish airports. The UK and the EU imposed sanctions on the crude oil tanker in October 2024 and February 2025. The EU has indicated that the tanker is involved in the transport of Russian oil. Estonia released the ship on the 26th of April, after it was detained for sailing without a valid national flag. At that time, the inspection found more than 40 violations. The Boracay is part of a so-called shadow fleet that transports Russian oil, whose ships have no known owner, no valid insurance, and are typically more than 20 years old. The ship that was seized is currently off the west coast of France.

JSW MG Motor India logs 34% rise in September sales,"The carmaker sold 6,728 units during the period, attributing the growth to GST rate reduction and onset of Navratri season. JSW MG Motor India on Wednesday reported a 34 per cent rise in its monthly sales to 6,728 units in September 2025, compared to 5,021 units sold in September 2024. The company attributes growth in numbers to recent GST rate reduction and the onset of the Navratri festive season, both of which boosted consumer sentiment and provided strong sales momentum.

Michelin rolls out first Made-in-India premium passenger car tyre from Chennai plant,"Michelin has invested ₹686 crore in the car tyre production line, in addition to its earlier ₹2,800 crore investment in the Chennai plant inaugurated in 2009. French tyre major Michelin on Tuesday launched its first Made-in-India premium passenger vehicle tyre at its manufacturing facility in Chennai, marking a significant milestone in its localisation journey. The tyres, set to compete with homegrown brands such as MRF, JK Tyre, Apollo and Ceat, will be commercially available across India by the first half of 2026. According to Hindu BusinessLine, Michelin has invested ₹686 crore in the car tyre production line, in addition to its earlier ₹2,800 crore investment in the Chennai plant inaugurated in 2009. According to Shantanu Deshpande, Managing Director, Michelin India, the new passenger car tyre facility was built in a record 12 months. It will produce 16 to 22-inch tyres across multiple ranges including LTX Trail ST, Pilot Sport 4 SUV, Pilot Sport 5, and Primacy 5 -- the first model to roll out from the new line. ""The tyres manufactured in Chennai will primarily serve the Indian market,"" Deshpande told reporters, adding that the company's India journey reflects the nation's own growth story. ""With rising disposable income, improved infrastructure, and evolving consumer preferences, the Indian passenger car market is growing rapidly and becoming more premium."" Deshpande said Michelin's focus will remain on SUVs and large vehicles, which now account for over 50 per cent of the market. Despite local production, tyre prices will remain unchanged. India's passenger vehicle tyre market, valued at $18 billion in 2024, is projected to touch $34 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of nearly 11 per cent, buoyed by premiumisation and recent GST reforms, the company said in a release. Globally, Pune has emerged as a strategic hub for Michelin, housing its digital and IT centre, AI and data transformation teams, and a global R&D centre employing over 1,300 professionals. The R&D unit, with around 350 employees, focuses on developing new materials, research tools, and simulation technologies, while supporting Michelin's operations across 33 countries. Vitor Silva, President of Michelin's Africa, India and Middle East region, said, ""If we grow as per plan, the Chennai plant would become one of the largest facilities for Michelin globally.""",ETAuto.com,2025-10-01T10:12:26Z,https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/tyres/michelin-rolls-out-first-made-in-india-premium-passenger-car-tyre-from-chennai-plant/124255835,2025-10-01 18:30:02.418210,0.1843137254901961

VIDEO | Mabuza moved his millions from pension fund to living annuity after retiring - Alexforbes,"A living annuity is an insurance product, regulated by the Long-Term Insurance Act and the Income Tax Act, where the policyholder's nominated beneficiaries receive the remaining capital portion of the investment upon death Emunah also said she was Mabuza's widow, as they were married under customary law in 1999, and while they were separated at the time of his death, they never divorced, she said. On Tuesday, Tamara successfully blocked the distribution of her father's R44.7m pension fund through an urgent court application. Alexforbes, however, said a living annuity is not a retirement fund and is not governed by Section 37C of the Pension Funds Act which Tamara's lawyer had relied on in his argument. Doctor Sibuyi, Tamara's lawyer had said in his argument that the nomination form only includes a person's wishes which is just a guide. ""So in section 37 (of the Pension Funds Act), it takes a consideration of the constitution when it comes to the issues of not leaving dependents of the deceased going to the streets. ""The law say when the deceased dies it doesn't mean that the life of the dependents comes to stand still and they go to the street. Hence the court have got the right to play to protect the constitution,"" he said.

Nonprofit wages years-long war against aggressive vine: 'It's a win-win',"At first glance, the River's Edge Preserve in Falmouth, Maine, looks like a peaceful, green escape. But behind the calm scene, the Falmouth Land Trust has been locked in a yearslong battle with an invasive vine called bittersweet. This woody plant strangles trees, crowds out native species, and leaves behind what conservationists call a ""food desert"" for birds and pollinators, per the Portland Press Herald. The Herald also reported that the Falmouth Land Trust acquired the 24-acre preserve in 2024, and the land was overrun. The ongoing battle of clearing it has required saws, herbicides, and a whole lot of patience. ""It's a win-win for developers and to help conserve some land,"" developer David Chase said to PPH, explaining that the preserve was donated as part of a nearby housing project. For the trust, the win is access to a slice of riverfront forest and a chance to bring balance to the ecosystem. This restoration matters far beyond this one preserve. Invasive plants like round-leaved bittersweet are a headache not just for conservation groups but for homeowners, too. They spread fast, require constant maintenance, and can turn even a small yard into a tangled mess. Not to mention, these invasive plants can outcompete the native plant life. Bittersweet, especially with its massive weight, can smother plants and even go as far as uprooting trees. One Good Samaritan took on the challenge of manually removing bittersweet from a local public trail all by himself. This endeavor couldn't have been simple, considering that bittersweet can be as thick as a human forearm. Luckily, there are ways to combat this overgrowth beyond manual pulling and tugging. Rewilding a yard or green space with native plants can have many benefits, saving you both money and time on maintenance. The Falmouth Land Trust knows it will take years to fully push back the bittersweet. But every patch of milkweed and every returning bird is proof that native plants can thrive again when given the chance.",The Cool Down,2025-10-01T10:15:00Z,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/bittersweet-invasive-plant-removal-falmouth-land-trust-vines/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.420441,0.2313725490196079
Warm climate boosts grape growth,"A worker emptying a bucket full of grapes at the Dr Lindicke vineyard in Werder. -- AFP The morning sun shines on lush vines as harvesters pick grapes. The hillside vineyard looks like it could be in Italy but lies near Berlin, Germany where climate change has transformed winemaking. The 75-year-old owner, Manfred Lindicke, said that rising global temperatures over the decades had helped his grapes sweeten and ripen earlier. ""When I started here in 1996, we used to harvest around Oct 1,"" he said. ""Now we start on Sept 1."" The climate crisis may be wreaking havoc globally on island nations, deserts and coastal regions, and intensifying disasters from droughts and wildfires to hurricanes and floods. But in some regions, businesses have benefited from some of its impacts - including on Lindicke's 7.6ha vineyard in Werder, about 35km southwest of the German capital. His wine production is among the northernmost in Europe and on the same latitude as Mongolia and Alaska in the United States. Grapevines were grown here in the Middle Ages but disappeared by the mid-19th century ""due to frost and economic hardships"", Lindicke said. After Germany's 1990 reunification, pioneers brought winemaking back to this corner of the formerly communist-ruled east, a picturesque town close to the city of Potsdam. They have benefited from a rise in average summer temperatures of more than 1°C since, said Ernst Buescher of the German Wine Institute. Over 200ha of vineyards have been planted in northern Germany since the European Union in 2016 permitted members to expand land used for vineyards by up to 1% a year. Lindicke says his vineyard is now harvested a month earlier compared to previous years. Suitable temperatures About 20 wineries have since also sprung up in the nearby western German state of Lower Saxony, which stretches up to the North Sea. ""Now we have suitable temperatures,"" said Jan Brinkmann, head of the state's winemaking association. ""It was only made possible by climate change."" Brinkmann decided to swap grains on part of his own land for grapes because the vines are a hardier, ""less vulnerable"" crop, he said. But he granted that it ""will certainly take time"" for the product to mature into a truly fine wine. Werder, for its part, already makes impressive Pinotin, a light and fruity red. ""The wine keeps improving, especially the reds,"" said volunteer Peter Weymann, 71, who asserted that nowadays ""German winemakers have no need to fear the Italians or the Spanish"". But Lindicke said that climate change cuts both ways, with the weather now more unpredictable. Early harvests, late frosts, droughts and intense sun scorching some grape varieties have all presented growing problems. ""August was relatively dry until its last week,"" he said, adding that a drip irrigation system fitted to local water pipes meant that ""we could cover the whole 7.6ha"". But the last week of August brought ""a lot of rain, much too much"", he added. For now, German winemakers are ""generally winners from climate change"", Buescher said, but added that the flipside was a rise in extreme weather and some crop diseases. ""Changes in the climate have brought an increasing number of risks for German winemaking in recent years,"" he added. Those risks include downy mildew, a plant disease that flourishes in wet weather, as well as esca, a fungal infection that prefers hot, dry summers. Fungus-resistant grape varieties now take up three percent of Germany's cultivated vineyards and about half of Lindicke's. The climate adaptation efforts make life harder for German winemakers as they battle against the well-established industries in southern Europe. Lindicke said all of this makes it harder to stay competitive against mass-produced wine from neighbouring countries. ""If you can buy a Sauvignon Blanc from France for €2.50 (RM12.40) and mine costs €12 (RM59) or €15 (RM74), it doesn't make sense,"" he said. At 75, he is still searching for somebody to take over the family vineyard. - AFP",The Star ,2025-10-01T10:23:13Z,https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/living/2025/10/01/warm-climate-boosts-grape-growth,2025-10-01 18:30:02.421140,-0.1450980392156863

"Gold hits fresh all-time high as bulls target $3,900 ahead of US data","The USD touches a one-week trough and further acts as a tailwind for the precious metal. Gold (XAU/USD) continues to scale new record highs through the first half of the European session and has now moved well within striking distance of the $3,900 mark amid a supportive fundamental backdrop. Rising geopolitical tensions, along with the US government shutdown, weigh on investors' sentiment and underpin the safe-haven precious metal. Apart from this, the growing acceptance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower borrowing costs two more times by the end of this year turns out to be another factor driving flows towards the non-yielding yellow metal. Meanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) selling bias remains unabated for the fourth consecutive day amid dovish Fed expectations and offers additional support to the Gold. The strong move up seems rather unaffected by extremely overbought conditions on the daily chart, suggesting that the path of least resistance for the XAU/USD pair remains to the upside. That said, it will still be prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation or a modest pullback before positioning for any further gains. Traders now look to the US ADP report and the US ISM Manufacturing PMI for a fresh impetus. From a technical perspective, the overnight goodish rebound from sub-$3,800 levels and the subsequent move up validate the near-term positive outlook for the Gold price. That said, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains well above the 70 mark and points to extremely overbought conditions. This, in turn, makes it prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation or a modest pullback before positioning for any further appreciating move. Meanwhile, any corrective slide below the $3,835 immediate support is more likely to attract some buying near the $3,816 area, representing a short-term ascending trend-line. Some follow-through selling, leading to a subsequent breakdown and acceptance below the $3,800 mark, could pave the way for deeper losses and drag the Gold price to the next relevant support near the $3,758-3.757 region. The downfall could extend further towards the $3,735 support before the XAU/USD eventually drops to the $3,700 round figure.",FXStreet,2025-10-01T08:19:03Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gold-eases-after-refreshing-record-high-bullish-potential-seems-intact-202510010408,2025-10-01 18:30:02.422352,0.4588235294117646
Niagara Bottling holds resource rally with Hamburg Area School District,"Niagara Cares, the charitable division of Niagara Bottling, joined with anti-hunger organization Feed the Children and the Hamburg Area School District to distribute resource kits to families in need.

Authentic Cuban Restaurant Coming to Lafayette in 2026,"Recently, we've heard about a new Kartchner's Specialty Meats heading to Youngsville, the old Burger King on Johnston St near campus getting a new tenant, along with a closure of one of the Starbucks in Lafayette.

Leading UK tech investor warns of 'disconcerting' signs of AI stock bubble,"James Anderson voices concern over soaring valuations of artificial intelligence firms A leading British tech investor has described soaring valuations of artificial intelligence companies as ""disconcerting"", amid concerns of an AI stock market bubble. James Anderson was an early backer of Tesla, Amazon and China's Tencent and Alibaba, generating vast returns for Baillie Gifford's flagship fund. Now at the Italian investment company Lingotto, Anderson said he had not seen signs of an investment bubble until recently, when the ChatGPT developer, OpenAI, and the rival Anthropic announced hefty valuation increases. ""Up until the last couple of months or so ... what surprised me in one sense is that there wasn't really much sign of a bubble [in AI],"" he told the Financial Times. OpenAI is reportedly in talks about a share sale that would value the startup at $500bn (£370bn), up from $300bn in April and $157bn last October. Anthropic almost trebled its valuation recently, going from $60bn in March to $170bn last month. ""I think one needs to be honest that those sudden increases [in valuation] that people were willing to place on OpenAI, Anthropic and the like were disconcerting,"" he said. ""That scale of jump and the pace with which it happened did bother me."" Anderson also raised concerns about Nvidia's investment of up to $100bn in OpenAI. Nvidia is a key player in AI infrastructure as a maker of the computer chips that are used in training and operating AI models, a position that has driven it to a stock market valuation of $4.5tn. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. Some commentary around the deal has raised parallels with vendor financing, where a company provides financial support to a customer buying its products. Anderson said he was a ""huge admirer"" of Nvidia but the OpenAI deal presented ""more reason to be concerned there than before"". Referring to a practice common in the turn of the millennium dotcom bubble, when telecom equipment makers lent money to customers, he said: ""I have to say the words 'vendor financing' do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. ""It's not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000 but it has certain rhymes to it. I don't think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view."" Anderson is the managing partner of Lingotto's innovation strategy fund.

Add Up The Pieces: IGE Could Be Worth $54,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares North American Natural Resources ETF (Symbol: IGE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $53.74 per unit. With IGE trading at a recent price near $49.05 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.57% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IGE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Baytex Energy Corp (Symbol: BTE), Cenovus Energy Inc (Symbol: CVE), and Uranium Energy Corp (Symbol: UEC). Although BTE has traded at a recent price of $2.34/share, the average analyst target is 29.02% higher at $3.02/share. Similarly, CVE has 15.97% upside from the recent share price of $16.99 if the average analyst target price of $19.70/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting UEC to reach a target price of $15.22/share, which is 14.08% above the recent price of $13.34. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BTE, CVE, and UEC: Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above: Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA - Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. Recommended Videos ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",WKMG,2025-10-01T10:12:31Z,https://www.clickorlando.com/tech/2025/10/01/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-this-year-the-fourth-biggest-retreat-on-record-experts-say/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.425245,-0.03529411764705881
World's first AI law firm recovers $10k of debt in bombshell 'game changer' - Daily Star,"The world's first AI law firm that recovered £7,000 ($9.4k) debt for a small business in record time has been hailed a ""genuine game changer"". Garfield AI drew up a legally compliant letter for a customer short on time and money. Employees paid just £7.50 -- around the price of a pint in London -- for the accurate document which quickly recovered the funds, just months after being approved by Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). Now AI and financial experts have said it could be a game changer and believe it will scare slack businesses into coughing up overdue funds. Mitali Deypurkaystha, founder and CEO at Impact Icon AI, said the firm ""demonstrates the ingeniousness of AI done right"" while also highlighting its limitations. She added: ""For small business owners, chasing debts isn't just admin. It's exhausting and demoralising. Garfield AI lifts that mental weight. I also commend the creators for keeping Garfield AI affordable, even for solopreneurs. ""But the current UK £30bn cashflow logjam persists because FTSE350 giants behave like schoolground bullies, imposing 90-120 day terms that crush smaller suppliers. That's not late payment, that's unethical payment. ""I fear some firms use these terms knowing a percentage of small suppliers will fold, effectively pocketing free goods and services."" Early users range from sole traders to blue-chips, and professional services firms including law firms, accountancy and medical firms. Many small businesses are forced to write off billions of pounds in unpaid invoices every year. But Omer Mehmet, managing director at Welling-based Trinity Finance, said it could be a gamechanger for small businesses as it turns a drawn out, expensive process into something that takes minutes and costs pocket change. He said: ""Late payments strangle small businesses, and most owners simply don't have the time or money to chase every overdue invoice. An AI tool that can send a compliant legal letter for less than the cost of a pint is a genuine game changer. ""If it works as promised, it could unlock thousands for SMEs who currently write off debts as 'too small to fight'. Anything that gives entrepreneurs back their cashflow and headspace is a win."" But Kate Underwood, managing director at Kate Underwood HR and Training, urged: ""Debt recovery isn't just admin you can automate, it's law -- and law is messy. Shiny new tech won't mean a thing if the process doesn't stand up in court. If that happens, it's not progress, it's just another false hope for small businesses."" One of the first businesses in the world to use legal AI to recover a problematic debt was transport consultancy Mayer Brown Limited. From sign-up to sending a legally compliant Letter Before Action took the firm less than five minutes at a cost of just £7.50 (+VAT). Finance director David Bone said: ""Using Garfield allowed us to successfully recover around £7,000 in outstanding invoices with only a few minutes of work. It is an incredibly effective and efficient tool that has really helped with debt recovery."" In the past month, numerous Garfield users have seen debts paid in full after either LBAs or Claim Forms at Court were issued using the unique AI-powered legal engine. Customers pay £2 (+VAT) for a polite legal chaser letter moving up to £7.50 (+VAT) for a formal Letter Before Action. Around 80% of cases settle at these early stages. If they don't, users can escalate to issuing court claims electronically through the platform at a fraction of the price of hiring a traditional law firm, with many costs recoverable on success. Philip Young, Co-Founder of Garfield AI, said: ""Invoices should mean money in your bank, not a line gathering dust on an aged debtors' report. ""For the first time, SMEs no longer have to shelve plans of chasing outstanding debt just because they are afraid of the upheaval and cost. Too often the time to recover debt can disincentive SME owners from doing it, but AI collapses the time from hours or even days into minutes. ""Unlocking the £11bn trapped in late payments will be a game-changer for UK business. With a faster, fairer way to recover money owed, entrepreneurs can focus less on chasing debts and more on growing their companies, creating jobs and driving innovation.""",Daily Star,2025-10-01T10:18:15Z,https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/worlds-first-ai-law-firm-35994168,2025-10-01 18:30:02.425768,0.0117647058823529

Dave's Hot Chicken has confirmed the location and opening date of the brand's second London restaurant,"If you've strolled by Shaftesbury Avenue anytime over the last nine months, you'll no doubt be familiar with the huge queues and spicy aromas snaking out of Dave's Hot Chicken. The viral US chicken chain, backed by the likes of Drake and Samuel L. Jackson, opened its first London branch in December last year and hordes of hungry Londoners were immediately lining the street to get a taste. Two more outposts have since opened in Birmingham and Manchester and it's just been confirmed that a second Dave's Hot Chicken branch will be coming to London very soon. Another Dave's is expected to launch at Westfield White City this month, following an agreement with hospitality investment group Azzurri. The group (which also operates Zizzi and Coco di Mama sites) has signed an exclusive deal with the cult chicken chain, agreeing to develop at least 180 restaurants across 10 European countries, 60 of which will be in the UK and Ireland. You can find out more about the potential British locations here. The opening date has been revealed as October 24. In the meantime, you'll just have to join the queues in the West End. Although there have been reports of punters waiting up to four hours for their extra hot chicken tenders (which get so spicy you have to sign a waiver), Time Out's food editor Leonie Cooper found that the wait wasn't 'actually too bad' and only lasted around 20 minutes. When Leonie paid Dave's a visit, she reported that the chicken 'is actually really very good, with a crunchy, quality batter and soft, well-cooked meat' and 'a lot juicier than other high street chicken joints'.

Ringside: Newsom's Concessions to Oil Industry Will Not Save It,"Ringside: Newsom's Concessions to Oil Industry Will Not Save It The City of Los Angeles could improve its air quality if it resumed oil drilling By Edward Ring, October 1, 2025 2:55 am 01 Oct 2025 2:55 am Access to adequate supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel for Californians is in dire peril, and the signing of SB 237 on September 19 will do very little to change that. To rescue the industry, far more sweeping legislation is required. First, to put this in perspective, note that fully 50 percent of California's raw energy inputs still rely on petroleum. We can debate the virtues and detriments of fossil fuel all we like, but we can't change this math. Californians need petroleum products, and at the same time, our state legislature has systematically attempted to destroy the industry. The supposed breakthrough represented by SB 237 by Sen. Tim Grayson (D-Contra Costa) is that it will restart permitting for drilling. It directs CalGEM (California's Geologic Energy Management Division) to issue up to 2,000 drilling permits. This volume of permitting is necessary to sustain production, but under pressure from state agencies and regulators, the volume of drilling permits has steadily dropped; only 74 were granted in 2024. As a result, California's in-state oil production has dropped from a high of 402 million barrels in 1986 to only 118 million barrels in 2024. But consumption has not fallen nearly as fast. In 1986 California consumed 676 million barrels of oil, and that total has only declined to 511 million barrels in 2024. We now import 77 percent of our petroleum. The inadequacies with SB 237 are many. To begin with, it only directs CalGEM to issue a higher volume of permits in Kern County. This leaves areas of the state with high value fields completely cut off, including Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. Even if Kern County drillers were reactivated overnight under ideal conditions, they could not produce enough oil to replace what's being lost as existing wells everywhere else are being forced to shut down, or are naturally depleted and deactivated. Moreover, SB 237 does not allow for fracking, and most of the oil wells in Kern County require fracking. California's regulators do not acknowledge that in contrast to Texas, fracking in California is done in relatively soft soil and at shallower depths. This means it requires far less energy and far less water, and has a far more localized impact. Fracking in California is responsible and safe, but CalGEM is keeping it out of bounds. Compounding the problems with SB 237 is the fact that it does not override SB 1137 which puts boundaries on oil fields. SB 1137, currently in litigation, restricts drilling to areas that are at least 3,200 feet away from any inhabited structure. Unless SB 1137 is overturned, it will further limit how much oil can be extracted in Kern County, or anywhere else in California. The next link in California's endangered oil supply chain are the major north/south pipelines that carry oil from California's wells to California's refineries. As it is, thanks to the steady decline in production, the major pipelines moving oil in California are flowing at rates that are almost too low to be sustained. The pipelines cannot operate if the flow of oil is much below 25 percent of their capacity, and right now they are approaching that tipping point. The pipelines also have to charge far more per barrel when they're so underutilized, since their fixed costs don't change. Less oil. No way to move the oil to refineries. And then there are the refineries themselves. Operators are justifiably asking why they should stay active in a state that regulates their profits, micromanages their storage and distribution, and imposes environmental regulations far in excess of any other state or nation. As it is, two major refineries, Valero in Northern California, and Phillips 66 in Southern California, have both announced they will cease operations. When this happens, California's refineries will not have the capacity to supply the state's current demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. What Californians need is a practical approach to energy policy, one that includes a long overdue acknowledgment of facts that contradict the incessant, rote demonization of fossil fuel. For example, natural seepage of oil in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties releases into our air and water more oil, methane, and volatile organic compounds that the drilling itself. In fact, capped wells often release more gaseous pollution than active wells, and even with extremely expensive attempts to prevent that on a carefully capped well, the pressure that naturally builds under the cap means that gas inevitably escapes. The City of Los Angeles could improve its air quality if it resumed drilling. Someone closely following California's oil industry told me ""there is a reasonable chance SB 237 hasn't done anything at all. It's all just show."" Supporting California's oil and gas industry while committing to alternative fuel technologies as soon as they become competitive are not incompatible sentiments. And trying to kill an industry that still accounts for 50 percent of California's total energy consumption is suicide. Governor Newsom and the state legislature need to seriously confront the problems their governance has sown before these problems explode into an energy crisis that will make 1973 look like a picnic. SB 237 is a very, very small step in the right direction at most. More likely, it is merely a gesture.

"Race, rates, and energy insecurity: exploring racial disparities in electricity costs and consumption in U.S. utility service areas - Scientific Reports","Structural racism contributes to energy insecurity via housing and income pathways. However, little is known about the role of energy pricing in (re)producing racialized energy inequities. This study explores the relationship between annual electricity rates and the resulting consumption and billing for the average customer based on demographic characteristics for different types of electric utilities in three states: Alabama, California, and New York. Results indicate that utility service customers in predominately non-white communities pay higher energy prices but consume less energy compared to those in white communities. The association between these utility schemas and the demography of service areas is likely influenced by numerous intermediating factors, such as urbanity, housing conditions, and household income variation -- all of which are also shaped by historical racism. These findings call attention to the potential disparate impacts of energy service provision and costs across communities and add nuance to how energy insecurity may be powered. Energy expenses influence consumption patterns particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Many households that experience energy insecurity, defined as the inability to meet household energy needs, face a range of physical, economic and coping burdens that impair health, well-being, and wealth-building prospects. For example, households experiencing energy insecurity often limit their energy consumption because they cannot afford to pay their energy bills, therefore not using enough heating or cooling to maintain thermal comfort. Energy insecurity is observed differently by race such that Black, Indigenous, and Latino households disproportionately experience associated financial burdens, inefficiencies, thermal discomfort and trade-offs between basic necessities. Recent evidence shows that Black and Latino households pay 13-18% more on average for energy per square foot of housing compared to white households. A robust body of research demonstrates racial disparities in energy cost burdens; utility disconnections and power outages and gaps in receipt of energy efficiency and renewable energy services. Disproportionate exposure to energy insecurity is often attributed to income inequalities. However, income and wealth gaps are rooted in systemic and structural racism. As defined by Braveman et al., (2022) ""systemic and structural racism are forms of racism that are pervasively and deeply embedded in systems, laws, written or unwritten policies, and entrenched practices and beliefs that produce, condone, and perpetuate widespread unfair treatment and oppression of people of color, with adverse health consequences"". The synergistic effects of structural racism across various social institutions produce a range of hardships in and beyond the realm of energy. Structural racism fuels persistent disparities in health, housing and neighborhood quality. Discriminatory housing policies, in turn, foster a persistent cycle of racial residential segregation and physical disinvestment in certain communities. Consequently, minoritized groups are disproportionately relegated to economically and physically underprivileged places. The dynamics of structural racism permeate various facets of the energy supply and demand continuum. The same phenomena shaping racial residential segregation has also informed the placement and quality of energy infrastructure, contributing to disparities in access to alternative energy providers, ability to affect decision-making on energy rates (that is, the cost in dollars that a utility charges a customer or ""ratepayer"" per unit of energy), and living in areas with heavily polluting energy facilities along with concentrated substandard housing and more intense urban heat island effects that drive up electricity consumption. Emerging evidence suggests that the energy infrastructure that serves more racially diverse areas is older and less capable than the energy infrastructure that serves majority-white areas like other public and private physical investment. Moreover, minoritized groups face longer and more frequent power outages. These wide and varied examples of disparate racial impacts across the energy continuum suggest that there are indeed influences of structural racism at play. Yet, one understudied potential contributor to racially disparate exposures to energy insecurity are residential electricity prices that are the product of the current energy regulatory and market framework that interact with housing and community settings. A household's energy bill reflects energy consumption and limiting behaviors -- prompting the question of how pricing for this essential household expense also contributes to disproportionate burdens by race to contain costs and maintain service. In this way, rate differences may function as an upstream contributor to energy insecurity that is not only underexplored but may itself be a byproduct of structural racism. Figure 1 depicts various mechanistic links between structural racism and energy insecurity and shows the coalescence of macro- and micro-level factors including the unknown associations between energy pricing's downstream effects on energy insecurity. Operational and regulatory decisions inform the relationship between the energy provider and ratepayer. Residential locations dictate a household's electricity provider. Most Americans receive electricity from investor-owned utilities (IOUs). Of the approximately 3,000 electricity providers operating in the US, differing by type, size, governance, and regulation, 168 are IOUs serving 72% of U.S. customers. The remaining 28% of U.S. customers receive services from entities including 1,958 publicly owned utilities (POUs, or municipally owned utilities ""munis"") and 812 electric cooperatives (""coops""). POUs' and coops' leadership are publicly or ratepayer-elected, respectively, and report to local governments if not directly to ratepayer constituents. State public utility commissions (PUCs) have authority over IOUs but not over POUs or coops which are regulated by statute but governed locally. These utilities choose their electricity generation mix and ratepayer prices differently than IOUs. For example, coops own and operate a significant proportion of the distribution lines. Though rate regulations vary across states, they generally emphasize fairness (i.e., equal rates) over equity including pricing scaled by income. Electricity rates for all utility types are influenced by market as well as regulatory conditions; utilities make operational decisions about how to recover costs and obtain returns by providing service. Most IOUs establish rates after providing evidence of operational costs to PUCs along with a reasonable rate of return on their investments while guaranteeing customers access to electricity at stable prices. For example, California sets rates to cover capital improvements that may require higher rates in under-invested places (e.g. due to rurality, legacy of segregation, etc.). In all cases, the rate varies by service provider and providers vary by incorporation category; consequently, different utilities charge differing energy rates across places and populations. There are many rate structures a utility can impose, and these have vastly different equity effects. For example, flat or fixed rates are regressive, tiered rates and demand charges penalize inefficient homes often occupied by low-income households, and time-of-use rates affect those who cannot schedule their energy use. Rates are most often experienced by the customer through monthly utility bills, yet whether these bills are observed to vary by a range of housing and household characteristics such as race is unclear. Several pathways may explain a possible relationship between electricity rates and race. Communities of color are more likely to have limited access to POUs that charge lower rates in comparison with private large-scale utilities; to have limited ability to affect decision-making on rates given utility governance, and to be living in areas with inferior infrastructure requiring maintenance and upgrading whose costs are passed down to ratepayers. In short, past racist policy has led to contemporary variations in energy providers and services that, in turn, may lead to racial disparities in energy rates that entrench the historical racial inequities whether unintentionally or purposefully. A descriptive examination of differences in energy rates by race is an important first step in exploring the relationship between energy prices, energy insecurity and sociodemographic factors. Therefore, the research question we address is: Do energy rates vary geographically based on the racial composition of utility service areas?",Nature,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16419-1,2025-10-01 18:30:02.428238,-0.08235294117647063
Karishma showcases Namibian designs at Batho Fashion Week,"Namibian fashion designer and musician Karishma recently represented the country at Batho Fashion Week in Botswana, where she unveiled her latest collection alongside fellow Namibian creative director Fillemon Hamukoto. The event formed part of an exchange programme between MTC Windhoek Fashion Week and Batho Fashion Week, designed to promote African creativity across borders. Organisers say the initiative aims to provide young designers with international exposure, encourage collaboration and foster cultural dialogue within the continent's fashion industry. Karishma, who began designing in 2018 and is also known for her music career, says showcasing abroad was an opportunity to expand her reach and learn from peers. ""To share my vision in Botswana and exchange ideas with other African creatives was an honour,"" she says. ""I got to meet new creatives, learn from them and saw how events are organised there. She presented pieces from her Delux of Our 2024 Highschool Collection, alongside new additions aimed mainly at younger audiences but designed for all age groups. The collection explores the theme of individuality within unity. ""In my collection I used the same fabric, but the designs were different. I wanted to bring out the message that although we are all the same, we can still be different in our own ways,"" she explains. ""It shows that even simple things can be turned into a masterpiece."" Karishma describes fashion as a medium of identity and storytelling as much as clothing. ""Fashion gives me the platform to create things that make people happy. It's a space where I have the freedom to design and express myself,"" she says. Known for her unapologetic, culturally inspired designs, she says her participation was about more than personal achievement. ""The event was all about building bridges through fashion. I was excited to showcase Namibia to other countries and to represent our creativity on an international stage."" Karishma says she is already working on her next collection, set for release later this year. Batho Fashion Week organisers say collaborations like this highlight the growing importance of African designers in shaping global fashion narratives.",The Namibian,2025-10-01T10:22:25Z,https://www.namibian.com.na/karishma-showcases-namibian-designs-at-batho-fashion-week/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.428521,0.2705882352941176
Eskom's turnaround: R23.9bn profit and decreased load shedding,"Now, Eskom group chief executive Dan Marokane revealed that the profits will be ploughed back into the SOE. ""The focused and ongoing efforts of Eskom's 42,000 employees in delivering the turnaround strategy have produced tangible results. ""We are reinvesting profits back into national assets. ""Over the next five years, with continued rigorous focus, we will invest more than R320bn in sustaining and expanding our infrastructure for the long-term benefit of the nation. ""In a break from the past, we are accelerating the review and restructuring of our cost base. ""This is being done within the framework of the expected future single-digit tariff increases allowed by Nersa (National Energy Regulator of South Africa), as we drive efficiencies and take control of the factors within our control to address the affordability of electricity,"" Marokane said. He highlighted Eskom's ""vital"" importance to the country's economic growth prospects and job creation. ""According to a report by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, titled Utility-scale Power Generation Statistics in South Africa, published on 17 March 2025, the South African economy lost up to R2.8trn due to load shedding in the 2023 calendar year. ""In 2024, that figure was reduced by 83% to R481bn,"" Marokane noted. The power utility presented its group annual results for the 2025 financial year ended 31 March 2025 at Megawatt Park. Key notes from the announcement include: Eskom board chairperson Mteto Nyati reflected on the power utility's improvement since the ""crisis"" the board found three years ago. ""Eskom is increasingly a sustainable, investable company ready to compete in a liberalised, competitive energy market, and is very different from the crisis that in October 2022 the current Eskom board inherited when they took office. ""The comprehensive diagnostic review at the time reaffirmed Eskom's strategic direction and highlighted the need to recalibrate execution timelines and intensify delivery against strategic objectives that we have supported the executive committee to deliver. ""The board has remained utterly focused on using public money efficiently, and early interventions in governance and controls have delivered early measurable improvements in the fight against crime, fraud and corruption. ""Vending fraud as a result of our outdated online vending system is now reduced to lower levels, proving that a focus on stronger systems, smarter technology, and decisive action is protecting revenue and ensuring secure, reliable electricity for all South Africans, and we will continue to intensify our focus in this area,"" Nyati said.",Bizcommunity.com,2025-10-01T10:18:00Z,https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/eskom-turnaround-r239bn-profit-and-decreased-load-shedding-409249a,2025-10-01 18:30:02.428850,0.2705882352941176

"October Premium Bonds winners announced: Saver with just £7 won £50,000","Millions of Premium Bonds holders have woken up richer after NS&I announced the winners of October's prize draw. The luckiest of these are this month's jackpot winners who became millionaires overnight after they won £1 million from NS&I. The first is based in Scotland and is the lucky holder of bond number 498FZ511907. They bought the winning bond in April 2022 and held a total of £10,150 in Premium Bonds before winning the jackpot. They are Scotland's 30th jackpot winner. Meanwhile, the second jackpot winner is based in Greater Manchester and bought the winning bond in January 2023. Before winning with bond number 524KB804512, they held a total of £34,350 in Premium Bonds. They are Greater Manchester's fourth jackpot winner. The winners will have been paid a visit by Agent Million, an anonymous NS&I employee who travels up and down the country to inform jackpot winners of their luck, in the days before the announcement. Outside of October's jackpot winners, this month's Premium Bonds prize draw saw over six million other savers win prizes between £25 and £100,000, bringing the total prize pot to more than £399 million. Of these winners, 2,808 won high-value prizes between £5,000 and £100,000. Among them is one lucky saver with just £7 in Premium Bonds. They bought the winning bond in June 1971. Meanwhile, two winners won £25,000 and £10,000 from Premium Bonds they purchased in September 2025, the most recent month eligible for October's draw. Andrew Westhead, NS&I Retail Director, said: ""As autumn arrives, two winners from North East Scotland and Greater Manchester are settling into the season a million pounds richer. ""Premium Bonds offer tax-free prizes to savers with every £1 Bond having an equal chance of winning in the draw, and it's great to see our Scottish millionaire winning the jackpot with a holding of £10,150. ""Sometimes people don't update their contact details with us, which can lead to unclaimed prizes. In Greater Manchester, there's one £100,000 prize and two £50,000 prizes still waiting to be claimed from past draws."" Overall, there are currently 2,646,717 unclaimed Premium Bonds prizes worth £108,348,250 waiting to be claimed. The total number of prizes in October's Premium Bonds prize draw was 6,049,850, and the total prize pot was £399,290,100. Overall, a total of 133,096,700,225 Premium Bonds were eligible for this month's draw and winners were drawn at random by ERNIE, NS&I's prize-drawing computer. Alongside the two jackpot winners, 76 savers won prizes of £100,000, 151 won £50,000, and 304 won £25,000. Source: NS&I, 1 October 2025 The prize fund rate, the average rate of return for someone with average luck, for the October draw was 3.6%. Premium Bonds do not pay a set level of interest like other savings accounts. Instead, every £1 you save gives you a one in 22,000 chance to win one of the prizes each month. You do not have to pay any tax on your Premium Bonds winnings either, making them a good way to protect your savings from the taxman. Savers who have invested their money in Premium Bonds will be able to check if they won in this month's prize draw from 2 October.

"Namibia Hails Unity, Youth Empowerment and Cultural Heritage at Lusata Festival","Statement by Elijah Ngurare, prime minister of the Republic of Namibia, at the Lusata Annual Cultural Festival, Chinchimane, Zambezi region, 28 September 2025 ____________________________________________________________ It is with humility and great honour that I stand before this distinguished gathering as we join Litunga George Simasiku Mamili VII and the Mafwe community in celebrating this year's Lusata Cultural Festival at Chinchimane. On behalf of our president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who is attending the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I bring warm greetings to all traditional authorities here present. She urges you to continue leading with unity, as you have done so admirably, for it is this unity that strengthens our nation. Your solidarity during this year's cultural festivals - at Bukalo, Sangwali, Choi, and now here at Chinchimane - has left an indelible mark. It demonstrates the power of cultural pride and traditional leadership to unite our people. Future generations will look back and give thanks for leaders who safeguarded values, preserved customs, and ensured communities held together in times of challenge. I commend Litunga George Simasiku Mamili VII for extending invitations to fellow traditional authorities from across Namibia, Zambia, and Botswana. This is leadership of the highest calibre. When leaders stand united, their subjects will have no reason for division, but every reason to embrace their differences as a source of strength and inspiration for collective progress. Yesterday, in conversation with his royal highness, he reminded me of the Zambezi region's vast agricultural potential- its ability to be a breadbasket. Yet access to markets, agricultural implements, and water remain challenges. I therefore assure the Litunga and all traditional leaders that the government is committed to addressing these needs. We will continue drilling boreholes for communities, schools, and clinics; expand mini-desalination plants where water is brackish; and strengthen food production. Access to clean water and dignified sanitation is not a privilege - it is a human right. Our Sixth National Development Plan, under the leadership of president Nandi-Ndaitwah, is driven by the principle of 'Unity in Diversity: Natural Resources Beneficiation and Youth Empowerment for Sustainable Development'. This plan ensures that no Namibian is left behind. We must move from exporting raw materials to processing them locally, creating industries, jobs, and prosperity. Just as we advanced diamond cutting through Namibia Diamond Trading Company, so too must we establish factories for copper, lithium, uranium, and other resources. Already, steps are being taken. In Zambezi, plans for a mango processing plant are underway, in partnership with the University of Namibia. The president has directed that every region establish a factory aligned to its strengths. This is transformative development in action. At the centre of this transformation are our youth, who made up more than 70% of voters in the 2024 elections. Their voice matters. Tomorrow, in Gobabis, we will launch the National Youth Fund, as promised in the South West Africa People's Organisation Party Election Manifesto 2025-2030. Our duty is to translate their votes into hope, opportunity, and empowerment. As we celebrate Lusata, we celebrate more than culture - we celebrate the endurance of heritage, moral values, and traditional wisdom. We cannot detach ourselves from the customs that shaped us; instead, we must preserve them for generations to come. Lusata embodies this continuity, balancing cultural pride with modern development, including tourism that benefits, rather than displaces, communities. We must also remember the bold political decision taken by Litunga Simasiku Mamili IV in the early 1960s, when he joined forces with Brendan Simbwaye and the Caprivi African National Union, which later merged with the South West Africa People's Organisation, to fight for Namibia's liberation. He and his people paid dearly - through imprisonment, persecution, and the cruel deaths of heroes such as Lyaboloma, Mukwali, Kulibabika, and Masida. Their blood waters our freedom, and their sacrifices must never be forgotten or betrayed, especially by the youth of Mushobo wa Mafwe. Unity does not mean the absence of differences, but rather the presence of tolerance and harmony. That is the essence of leadership. Today, under the guidance of Litunga George Simasiku Mamili VII, the Mafwe people remind us that unity remains the key to peace, prosperity, and nation-building. Let us therefore celebrate Lusata with pride, in peace and harmony, ever mindful that our traditions are the roots of our nation and the foundation of our future.",The Namibian,2025-10-01T10:22:25Z,https://www.namibian.com.na/namibia-hails-unity-youth-empowerment-and-cultural-heritage-at-lusata-festival/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.430670,0.5764705882352941

XAUUSD | Bullish continuation for FOREXCOM:XAUUSD by AFOKE,"GOLD has recently broken its last High, shifting market structure and indicating Buyers are still in control. This break opened up a clear Demand Zone below, a small base or last bearish candle before the rise, which is a key area where unfulfilled buy orders may be resting. Price is likely to retrace back into this Demand Zone to fill those orders. Once it reaches this area, we expect buying pressure to resume and push price upward, honouring the imbalance left by the rise. Entry: I'm looking to buy from this Demand Zone on a pullback, adding to go long when price enters this area. This lets me enter at a discount price while trading in direction of the newly established upward momentum. Target: The first Target Profit (TP) is set at the next supply Zone above, where selling pressure might emerge. Stop Loss: To control risk, the Stop Loss (SL) is placed just below the demand Zone. If price drops below this area, it would invalidate the demand's ability to hold, signalling a potential reversal. ✅ Summary: * Market is bullish * Demand Zone below is a key area to watch for buying opportunities. * Buy upon retracement into Demand, with Stop Loss below and Target at supply above.",TradingView,2025-10-01T10:20:26Z,https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XAUUSD/YBTxlfiV-XAUUSD-Bullish-continuation/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.431344,-0.08235294117647063
Thousands across Ireland facing up to €600 increase as health insurance prices spike,"VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health are all increasing their costs from today Thousands of people across Ireland are set to pay higher health insurance costs as the three main health insurers are increasing their premiums from this week. VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health are all increasing their prices which will see some families costs rise a whopping 27%, up to €600 or more, when they renew their plan. READ NEXT: Over 1,000 gardaí injured as result of being assaulted in line of duty in past three years The premium rates charged by the three main health insurers will go up from today (Wednesday October 1), with VHI and Irish Life announcing an average increase of 3% and Laya Healthcare increasing by an average of 4.5%, marking the second increase by all three this year. Speaking on the increases, leading broker of Health Insurance Ireland, Dermot Goode, said customers should never rely on the average figures quoted above. ""In many cases, the actual increase will well exceed these average figures. More importantly, consumers are forgetting there there were other increases earlier in the year, which are also coming their way."" Depending on the plan they hold, Mr Goode said customers can expect to face increases of between 4% and 27%, and families who are insured with VHI can expect to pay an additional €156 to €428 when they renew.

It stated 46% (2.53 million people) of the population have private health insurance. There was an increase of 4,130 people with private health insurance in the three months to June which was down from an increase of 7,318 in the first quarter of the year.","Limerick Today: News, Sport, Jobs, Property, Cars, Entertainments & More",2025-10-01T10:22:06Z,https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/national-news/1907998/thousands-across-ireland-facing-up-to-600-increase-as-health-insurance-prices-spike.html,2025-10-01 18:30:02.431641,-0.06666666666666665
Step-by-step: How to renew the Brexit carte de séjour in France,"Back in 2020, as the Brexit transition period came to an end, Brits who were already living in France were required to apply for the carte de séjour residency permit. This group was given a specific card, the carte de séjour Article 50 TUE, sometimes known as the WARP (Withdrawal Agreement Residency Permit). Those who had lived here for more than five years in 2020 were given a 10-year card, so they have nothing to worry about now, but those who had lived here for less than five years were given a five-year card, which will soon be coming up for renewal. This article is aimed at a very specific group of people - those who have a carte de séjour bearing the words 'Article 50 TUE' on the front, and on the back 'Article 18 (1) Accord du retrait du Royaume-Uni de l'UE'. The card is held mostly by Brits, but can also be issued to close family members of Brits, even if they are of other nationalities. Brits who moved to France after 2020 and are on a different type of card are not affected. When? The next stage is knowing when to renew - this is within two months of the expiry date printed on the front of the card. Most of these cards were issued in early 2021 - giving a renewal date at the start of 2026 - but some were issued in late 2020. The two months are important; there is no point trying to renew before your card is within two months of its expiry date, as the application will be rejected. If you are worried that your préfecture will take more than two months to process the renewal request, you can request a récépissé (more on that below). How? This is where it gets more complicated, because instead of the reactivation of the national web portal that was used for the first application for the cards, this time renewal is done directly through the préfecture. An Interior Ministry spokesperson told The Local: ""The préfectures have been informed of the upcoming expiry of certain 'Article 50 TUE' permits and have been encouraged to post information on renewal procedures on their websites within the next week or two. ""Therefore, the best option is to apply directly to the préfecture."" Unfortunately not all préfectures apply the same procedures, so the process is likely to vary from place to place. Préfectures have been told to update their web pages with instructions for renewing the Brexit card, but at the time of writing, not many have done so. There is a web page that is currently under testing on the French government admin page 'demarches simplifiées' that offers an online renewal process specifically for the Brexit carte de séjour. However it specifies that people can only use it if they have found the link to the page on the website of their local préfecture. This seems to imply that some préfectures will use it, but not all. Hopefully, the majority will be encouraged to go for this option. The website is not currently live, and applications should not be submitted there, as the dossier is likely to be deleted during the testing process. The ANEF website, which is also used for renewing some types of carte de séjour, is currently displaying a message saying that it cannot deal with Brexit card renewals. We will update this article as soon as more information becomes available Paperwork We do know what paperwork will be needed to make the application, and Brits continue to benefit from the simplified renewal terms laid out in the Withdrawal Agreement. Specifically, you will need; You should not be required to show proof of financial means, nor should you be affected by recent law changes that require French language certificates for certain types of residency permits. It does appear, however, that the 'contract of engagement in republican values' will be required for a renewal of the Brexit card, with the French government specifically stating that this requirement includes Brits on the Article 50 card. The document simply needs printing out and signing. READ ALSO: French residency: How to complete France's new 'republican values contract' Which préfecture? The application must be made to the préfecture where you live. In most cases, this will be the same préfecture that issued the original card. However, if you have moved in the past five years, you need to provide updated details so that the address on your card is correct. Certain French préfectures are notoriously slow, and people may be worried that processing their renewal request will take more than two months - leaving them with an expired card and no way of proving their legal residency in France. In fact, it's a fairly common scenario for all foreigners in France that their existing residency card expires before the new one arrives - being in this situation does not make you sans papiers (undocumented), provided you made the application before the expiry date on your card. If you are in this position, you can use the récépissé - receipt of your application - in order to prove your legal status in France, and to travel - more information here. What if I got French/EU citizenship in the meantime? If you have become French within the last five years - or you have gained citizenship of another EU country such as Ireland - there is no need to renew your carte de séjour as you have the right to live and work in France under EU freedom of movement legislation.",The Local France,2025-10-01T10:19:40Z,https://www.thelocal.fr/20251001/step-by-step-how-to-renew-the-brexit-carte-de-sejour-in-france,2025-10-01 18:30:02.432282,0.04313725490196085
Brent Crude Bearish sentiment continuation  for TRADENATION:BRENT by TradeNation,"The Brent Crude Oil is currently trading with a bearish bias, aligned with the broader downward trend. Recent price action shows a retest of the resistance, suggesting a further selling pressure within the downtrend. Key resistance is located at 6746, a prior consolidation zone. This level will be critical in determining the next directional move. A bearish rejection from 6746 could confirm the resumption of the downtrend, targeting the next support levels at 6550, followed by 6500 and 6424 over a longer timeframe. Conversely, a decisive breakout and daily close above 6746 would invalidate the current bearish setup, shifting sentiment to bullish and potentially triggering a move towards 6800, then 6874. Conclusion: The short-term outlook remains bearish unless the Brent Crude Oil breaks and holds above 6746. Traders should watch for price action signals around this key level to confirm direction. A rejection favours fresh downside continuation, while a breakout signals a potential trend reversal or deeper correction.

"Morrisons to introduce new £15 change that will affect over 1,000 stores - Daily Record","Morrisons has announced a positive change for those who shop at one of its smaller stores. The move will affect anyone signed up to the retailer's More loyalty scheme. From Wednesday, October 8, the supermarket will be launching its new 'Spend-Stretch' promotion that will allow loyalty members to reach the coveted 'Fiver' when they shop at a Morrisons Daily store. The smaller stores operate a convenience store format, offering a wide range of groceries, household essentials and extended hours for local communities, with at least 1,700 across England, Scotland and Wales. Exclusive to the retailer's smaller convenience stores, the new initiative will see anyone with a More card earn an extra 1,500 points when they spend £15 or more when they scan their card or app. It marks the latest milestone for the roll-out of Morrisons' More card scheme to its franchise stores that began in summer, becoming the first in the sector to offer a loyalty scheme to franchised stores. An additional 200 own brand lines will also be available over the next five weeks, with over half being fresh. The smaller branches will also offer shoppers 30 items from Morrisons' premium The Best range, offering both quality and value. Morrisons' loyalty scheme has undergone many changes since it first launched in 2014 as the 'Match & More' card, with the scheme offering its members exclusive deals and discounts on various products in store and online. It allows customers to bank a total of five points on every item they scan with the app or card, with a total of 5,000 points earning them the Morrisons 'Fiver' that can be redeemed on future shops. Earlier this year, the loyalty scheme was expanded with the launch of the Morrisons More Partner Points, allowing shoppers to earn points faster when shopping at over 300 participating brands. Available when shopping either on the Morrisons More App or More website, members can now earn points when they shop at one of the supermarket's new partners that now include the likes of eBay, Very, Just Eat and Expedia. In further Morrisons related news, the supermarket is also said to be trialling a major change to its trolleys in a move that will also help shoppers to save money when in stores. It's been reported that new AI-powered smart trolleys will be introduced for a test period at one Morrisons branch, although the location has not been confirmed, before potentially being rolled out to the rest of the UK. These trolleys have been launched in partnership with American firm Instacart and they allow customers to keep a track of the prices of their baskets or trolleys by using a barcode scanner. They also help guide with placing and weighing individual products through the use of high-tech features including interactive screens, built-in scales and AI-powered sensors. Katharine Challinor, Head of Retail for franchise at Morrisons, said: ""Rolling out More Card in franchise stores is part of our commitment to driving value for our customers however they shop with us. ""This exclusive promotion is a significant opportunity for our franchise partners, as well as a celebratory moment for us as the More Card roll-out nears completion in these stores.""",Daily Record,2025-10-01T10:14:46Z,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/morrisons-introduce-new-15-change-35994615,2025-10-01 18:30:02.433514,0.4274509803921569
$25m dream house nightmare - Overseas-based nurse feels cheated by,"For more than a year, Marcia* poured every penny of her nurse aide salary in the United States of America into building her dream home in Jamaica. More than $25 million later, all she has to show is a cold, unfinished concrete shell, and the contractor is now demanding $10 million more to finish the job. The 43-year-old, whose name is being withheld, told THE STAR that what was supposed to be her retirement paradise has instead become a financial nightmare. ""I borrowed, I worked, I begged family and friends. Every cent went into this house,"" Marcia said. Marcia said she first met the contractor in 2022 through a recommendation linked to a housing development company. At first, he was only supposed to draw plans for her two-storey extension -- four bedrooms on the ground floor, and three more upstairs. But soon, he offered to take on the construction himself. Trusting the recommendation, and after confirming that other contractors quoted similar prices, she gave him the job. But there was no signed contract -- just WhatsApp messages and video updates. By late 2022, she started sending money. Even when she lost her job and later fell ill, she kept making payments, borrowing from family and friends to keep the project alive. By January 2023, the work began. But progress stalled, she said, as the contractor allegedly abandoned her site for other jobs. ""He stopped and did another job, then started again, then stopped. By October, I only found out through the tenants that no work was happening,"" she recalled. To date, Marcia says she has sent over $25.3 million -- yet her house is still incomplete and without basic fixtures. Now, the contractor wants another $10 million to finish the job. ""This house means a lot to me. It's what I want for my retirement, and I planned for the downstairs to be rental income. But my house should have [been] done a long time [ago]. Do you think this is fair to me?"" she asked. Construction adviser Pervice Rodgers, of the Incorporated Master Builders Association, said Marcia's experience is far too common, especially among overseas Jamaicans. ""Construction has to be supervised. Concrete must be poured properly, walls must be roughcast and rendered. Some workers don't know the proper engineering standards,"" Rodgers warned, noting that without oversight, clients can be overcharged. ""You might need only 20 bags of cement, and they buy 40. That's a problem in construction."" He also urged against hefty upfront payments. ""Don't pay people money in advance. Suppose him dead? Building a house is not easy, unless you have some sort of connection, and you must ensure you have someone who knows how concrete works."" Rogers says, too, that rising labour and materials costs are real issues that drive up the price of construction projects on the island. For Marcia, though, those industry woes mean very little at this time. She just wants her house complete, and she is not prepared to spend much more. ""I only want to know if all the $25 million I sent was really spent on my house,"" she said.",The Jamaica Star,2025-10-01T10:19:33Z,http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20251001/25m-dream-house-nightmare-overseas-based-nurse-feels-cheated-contractor,2025-10-01 18:30:02.433862,0.1607843137254903

The woodland adventure theme will include model animals, toadstools and water features. There will also be picnic tables and overall the construction will use locally-sourced materials such as natural stone and timber. Shibden Hall is a listed building in Halifax which is surrounded by the Shibden Park estate. The hall itself dates back to 1420 and is now run as a museum by Calderdale Council. It was once home to the Lister family who lived there for more than 300 years. Anne Lister, whose story is told in popular TV series Gentleman Jack, inherited the hall after the death of her aunt in 1836. The park itself features a café, boating lake, miniature railway and children's play area.

Missed tickets and ruined funerals - half of Brits report problems with wifi,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Belfast Live,2025-10-01T10:21:32Z,https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-32586318,2025-10-01 18:30:02.435175,-0.1294117647058823
AI programme worth over £3m to small business launches,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info A new programme worth over £3 million to skill-up small UK businesses with fully funded access to the latest custom AI productivity tools and training to free up time and boost growth has been launched by eBay. Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, the programme is open to all businesses which sell on eBay with up to 10,000 to be onboarded this year. With small businesses accounting for three-fifths of UK employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector, equipping them with the technology and skills to compete is critical to deliver growth. The programme will offer access to ChatGPT Enterprise for up to 12 months in addition to tailored training to help unlock its potential. Additional support will include a dedicated eBay team who will engage with sellers to develop custom GPTs which will be most beneficial to growing small businesses on eBay and beyond. There is strong appetite for using AI among UK small businesses, but also a need for assistance in applying it to achieve business impact. While 69% of online businesses feel excited (43%) or curious (26%) about AI's potential, many are still working out how to make best use of the technology for them. Broader AI adoption could deliver a step change in UK productivity, with the IMF estimating that the technology could add as much as £470 billion to GDP by 2035. eBay is the first online marketplace to provide OpenAI's tools and relevant training free to its small business customers. The training programme has been designed using insights from seller research and interviews which identified the greatest opportunities for AI to free up time and increase productivity. These include sessions on managing financial analysis, creating promotional campaigns and effective research. Training will take place virtually as well as moving to in-person sessions in 2026. Eve Williams, General Manager, eBay UK, said: ""The issue is no longer whether businesses should adopt AI. ""It is how quickly they can start before their competitors do. Those businesses and economies that don't invest in AI now risk being left behind. That's why eBay is investing to put world-class AI in the hands of small businesses and entrepreneurs, with no charge to them. ""We want British small businesses to win nationally and globally which means that the latest AI tools cannot be the preserve of big business. They should be in the hands of every small business in Britain."" Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Chief AI Officer, eBay, said: ""AI is reshaping ecommerce and eBay is all-in. We see this as a generational opportunity to reimagine buying and selling for our customers, powered by three decades of marketplace insights and cutting-edge models. ""With AI Activate, we're extending that vision to small businesses and making sure that they don't have to figure this out alone. Giving small businesses the same tools and advantages as big retailers means that they can innovate and grow to capitalise on the AI era."" The launch of eBay AI Activate reflects a broader focus for the company on capitalising on AI, with artificial intelligence now embedded at the heart of the business. eBay has already invested in equipping its employees with ChatGPT Enterprise globally, focusing on its use to enhance team creativity, exploration and productivity. Across the platform, more than 10 million sellers worldwide have used eBay's generative AI tools to create over 300 million listings, contributing several billion dollars of GMV, with more than 500,000 new listings generated every day. Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist at OpenAI commented: ""Small businesses power the UK economy, accounting for over 99% of the UK's firms. Yet for too long, they have not had the tools to drive increases in productivity the way larger firms do. ""This collaboration could change that. By putting world-class AI tools in the hands of 10,000 UK entrepreneurs, we're investing in the UK's economic engine. If we want to close the productivity gap, this is where to start.""

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",The Star,2025-10-01T10:21:03Z,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-this-year-the-fourth-biggest-retreat-on-record-experts-say/article_532f29cb-6683-5ec4-bd7b-56b6734bf01f.html,2025-10-01 18:30:02.435984,-0.05882352941176472
"Chat Control: Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Sweden shift their positions ahead of the October 14 meeting","So-called Chat Control seeks to introduce mandatory scanning of citizens' private chats, raising privacy and security concerns Less than two weeks away from another crucial meeting, EU nations are shifting their position on the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR). Germany previously made headlines for joining the countries opposing mandatory chat scanning. Yet, according to the latest data, the nation is now back among the undecided countries - and so is Belgium. On a more positive note, the likes of Italy, Sweden, and Latvia went from backing the bill to being undecided. Support for the controversial proposal to scan all European citizens' chat remains stronger, though, with 12 countries backing the bill at the time of writing. What's been nicknamed Chat Control seeks to introduce new obligations for all messaging services operating in Europe to scan users' chats - even if they're encrypted - in the search for both known and unknown CSAM material. A measure that has attracted strong criticism among political ranks and the tech industry alike. Now, pressure from within the EU Council and domestically has led to some changes among member representatives. That's something that could seriously affect the outcome of the meeting with the EU Justice Minister set for October 14. EU Council members were called to share their final positions on the Danish proposal of Chat Control on September 12, 2025. The bill failed to attract the necessary support yet again, but the Danish presidency decided to move forward nevertheless. As a source with knowledge of the matter told TechRadar back then, Danes were expected to use the time left before October 14 to try to convince some of the member states to reconsider their position. In this regard, the German jurist and former Member of the European Parliament, Patrick Breyer, reported that during the September 12 meeting, Denmark claimed that the European Parliament would refuse to extend the voluntary scanning law if the Council didn't find an agreement. That's something that Breyer previously deemed as a ""political backmail"" and, now, called out as a ""blatant lie."" ""There is no such decision by the European Parliament. There has not even been a discussion on this issue,"" Breyer said. ""We are witnessing a shameless disinformation campaign to force an unprecedented mass scanning law upon 450 million Europeans."" Lobbying is clearly working on the likes of Germany, which is thought to be a decisive factor in the Chat Control saga. Breyer is now calling all EU governments, but especially Germany, ""not to fall for this blatant manipulation."" He said: ""To sacrifice the fundamental right to digital privacy and secure encryption based on a fabrication would be a catastrophic failure of political and moral leadership."" The EU Council is now set to meet with the EU Justice Minister on October 14. What was previously thought to be only a formal sign-off is now deciding whether or not the proposal will land in the Parliament for the final trilogue negotiations. If Chat Control manages to survive the next step, ""our only chance is that the Parliament defends encryption in the trilogue negotiations,"" Director of Government Affairs and Advocacy at the Internet Society, Callum Voge, told TechRadar. Experts have long argued against the privacy and security dangers of so-called client-side scanning and the risks of undermining encryption. A concern that has pushed over 500 scientists to sign an open letter for the third time since 2022. Something that some of the best VPN providers slam as ""a major step backwards for privacy,"" too. Chat Control is far from being the only proposal that could endanger encryption protections for Europeans - and VPNs may also become a target next time, as some EU experts explicitly mentioned them as ""key challenges"" to investigative work.",TechRadar,2025-10-01T10:19:35Z,https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/chat-control-germany-belgium-italy-and-sweden-shift-their-positions-ahead-of-the-october-14-meeting,2025-10-01 18:30:02.436440,0.1686274509803922

Romance fraudsters jailed for stealing £2million,"Five men have been jailed after exploiting people through romance fraud and stealing more than £2m in a money laundering operation. There were 40 confirmed victims between 2017 and 2024, but the total number of suspected victims of fraud was 99, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Fawaz Ali, 27, Ebenezer Tackie, 42 and Michael Quartey, 28, were found guilty of money laundering offences and sentenced to four years and 10 months, four years and six months, and five years and six months in prison respectively at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday. Kwabena Edusei, 37, was sentenced to seven years and 10 months, while George Melseaux, 40, was sentenced to three years and nine months. One victim stated: ""I lost my home as I could not keep up with the cost of rising bills. ""I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I was scammed so I have not told anyone about this and have lied to my family and friends. ""I am very wary when any man tries to get close to me as I always wonder if he will try and scam me."" Another victim said: ""It's ruined me as a person, it took years for me to start to trust anyone again."" ""How can people live with themselves after the hurt they create and the long-lasting damage they leave behind?"" Victims were asked for money to cover fake expenses, including fines in remote locations or urgent travel costs. They transferred money to the bank accounts of the men or even sent cash in the post, according to the CPS. ""The men used flirtatious language to manipulate people into thinking they were entering into a genuine loving and caring relationship"", a CPS spokesperson said. The majority of the transactions were conducted in the UK with some overseas victims identified throughout Europe, USA and Australia. ""The criminals here showed complete disregard for their victims who were met on an online dating website for the sole purpose of exploiting and scamming them out of money, said Jane Mitchell, a specialist CPS prosecutor. ""They used grooming tactics to gain trust, which caused terrible emotional distress to victims.""",GraphicOnline,2025-10-01T10:13:51Z,https://www.graphic.com.gh/international/international-news/romance-fraudsters-jailed-for-stealing-gbp2million.html,2025-10-01 18:30:02.437372,-0.592156862745098

"Tata Sons IPO deadline ends! RBI Guv makes BIG statement on registration cancellation, says...","Amid speculation over Tata Sons' alleged non-compliance with the RBI's listing directive, Governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday clarified that an entity can continue operations as long as its registration remains valid. The RBI had directed certain entities, including Tata Sons the holding company of the salt-to-software conglomerate to complete their listing by September 30 this year. In response, Tata Sons had last year applied to surrender its core investment company (CIC) registration to avoid the listing mandate, but the central bank is reportedly yet to take a decision on the application. Replying to a specific question on whether Tata Sons has got an exemption from floating an initial public offer (IPO) for now, Malhotra said that an entity can continue with the business till its registration stands. ""Any entity which has a registration, till it is not cancelled... will continue to do its business,"" Malhotra told reporters at the customary post-policy-review press conference. The central bank brass has preferred being tight-lipped on the question of Tata Sons till now, and even on Wednesday, Malhotra initially parried the question, saying the regulator does not make entity-specific comments. The RBI had come out with a list of 15 entities, classifying them as Upper Layer under its Scale-Based Regulation for non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) and further asked them to list by September 30. All entities except Tata Sons, a CIC, have complied with the regulatory mandate. With the deadline for listing passing, and no clarity on the de-registration, there has been speculation on the way forward for the holding company of one of India's largest corporate groupings. Getting listed will thrust a slew of compliance burdens focused towards more disclosures on Tata Sons, while some argue that complying with the asks may be difficult for the diversified corporate grouping, which is present across a slew of businesses at various levels of maturity.","India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com",2025-10-01T10:18:49Z,https://www.india.com/business/tata-sons-ipo-deadline-ends-rbi-guv-makes-big-statement-says-entity-can-do-business-till-its-registration-is-not-cancelled-8108722/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.437934,0.0117647058823529

Detention to global honour: Rose Njeri earns TIME100NEXT nod after viral Finance Bill tool,"Rose Njeri Tunguru, a 35-year-old software developer from Nairobi, has been named to the 2025 TIME100NEXT list. This follows her creation of a digital tool that enabled Kenyans to express opposition to a controversial finance bill. Read: The recognition comes after a dramatic year in which her work sparked national debate, led to her detention. As a result, it cemented her as a symbol of civic tech and citizen activism in Kenya. In May 2024, Tunguru launched an online platform enabling citizens to email government officials directly about the proposed finance bill in efforts to foster citizen participation. Within days, however, her creation drew the attention of authorities. She was detained under Kenya's cybercrime laws, and her devices were seized. The arrest sparked public outrage, with human rights organizations such as 'Amnesty International Kenya,' calling for her immediate release. Tunguru's initial post on X, announcing the tool, quickly went viral, garnering nearly one million views and drawing global attention. The detention highlighted the tension between civic innovation and regulatory oversight in Kenya. Many observers saw the arrest as an attempt to silence citizen participation in the legislative process. ""Authorities want to ignore us like we are not part of the process as citizens,"" Tunguru said. ""We shouldn't just sit back and watch,"" she added. Read: Through her X handle, Tunguru shared her excitement on Tuesday: ""I'm incredibly honored and excited to share that I've been named in the 2025 #TIME100NEXT list! This recognition is not just mine but belongs to everyone who has walked this journey with me, challenged me, and inspired me to keep going."" The TIME100NEXT list traditionally honors individuals expected to shape the next decade.

Broadway actors threaten strike over health care funding,"Broadway actors are preparing to walk off the stage in a strike that would shut down 32 stage productions as theater attendance approaches its peak season, according to their union. Actors' Equity, a union that represents 900 current Broadway performers and stage managers, said it has yet to reach agreement on a new labor contract with the Broadway League, the trade association that represents theater owners, producers and operators. Negotiations continue, though the three-year contract ended on Sept. 28. A central issue in bargaining is healthcare and the contribution the Broadway League makes to the union's health care fund. Al Vincent Jr, executive director and lead negotiator for Actors' Equity, said the union is asking Broadway's employers to increase their contribution to the health care fund, which is projected to fall into a deficit by next May. The rate of contributions has been unchanged for more than a decade, even as smaller regional theaters in Kansas and Idaho oftentimes pay more, Vincent said. ""Asking our employers to care for our bodies, and to pay their fair share toward our health insurance is not only reasonable and necessary, it's an investment they should want to make toward the long-term success of their businesses,"" Actors' Equity President Brooke Shields said in a statement to Reuters, adding that she tore her meniscus on a Broadway show and continued dancing on it, ""painfully,"" for three months. ""That's just math. There are no Broadway shows without healthy Broadway actors and stage managers. And there are no healthy actors and stage managers without safe workplaces and stable health insurance."" The Broadway League issued a statement saying it continues to work toward an agreement. ""We all want to sustain the magic of Broadway for our audience,"" the Broadway League said in its statement to Reuters. ""We are continuing good-faith negotiations with Actors Equity to reach a fair agreement that works for Broadway shows, casts, crews and the millions of people from around the world who come to experience Broadway."" Other sectors of the entertainment industry have been roiled by labor unrest, with Hollywood actors and writers striking in 2023, as they fought for better compensation in the streaming TV era and curbs on the use of artificial intelligence. Video game actors staged a nearly year-long walkout as they sought protections against the use of artificial intelligence. Stage actors have already authorized the bargaining committee to call a strike. On Friday, the union began delivering ""strike pledge cards"" to the stage door, asking performers and stage managers to commit to a walkout. Kaylin Seckel, an ensemble cast member of Disney's ""The Lion King"" and understudy to Nala and Sarabi, said she ruptured her Achilles tendon during a 2022 performance and had to be carried off-stage by her scene partner. She underwent surgery to repair the injury, and lengthy physical therapy to help her return to the stage. Although workers' compensation covered many of her medical expenses, she relied on her union's health care to pay for acupuncture and other treatments. ""That was three years ago, and I require, to this day, other procedures and more physical therapy that I was denied under workers' comp,"" said Seckel. ""So for performers and stage managers in this industry, where your jobs are dangerous, ... without really good health insurance, it's difficult for us to do our jobs."" The last major Actors Equity strike was in 1968, when a three-day dispute closed 19 Broadway shows. The New York City mayor intervened, and helped both sides come to an agreement.",Daily Sabah,2025-10-01T07:40:00Z,https://www.dailysabah.com/arts/performing-arts/broadway-actors-threaten-strike-over-health-care-funding,2025-10-01 18:30:02.438700,0.2
OBBBA to slow down US community solar installations until 2030,"Moreover, Wood Mackenzie updated its cumulative five-year community solar outlook due to the passing of the OBBA and other federal policy changes. The new operational capacity outlook is 8% lower compared to the outlook published in Q2 2025. The new legislation ""has fundamentally altered the long-term market landscape, while slowing growth in mature markets"" for community solar, said the companies. The CCSA and Wood Mackenzie expect the market to contract by 29% this year. Steep declines in New York - the leading US state in community solar - and Maine have driven the contraction of community solar during the first six months of 2025. ""Overall, we expect national installed community solar capacity will contract by an average of 12% annually through 2030,"" said Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. This contrasts with the forecast made a year prior, when Wood Mackenzie forecast community solar to grow at an average annual rate of 5% until 2026 and shows how much the OBBBA has already impacted the community solar industry. On top of the steep declines in mature markets, the report said that programmes in other major markets are close to or at capacity with their targets and other states - including Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey - have seen their transition to new programmes stalled. New Jersey recently signed new legislation that seeks to build 3GW of new community solar by 2029. Markets with no community solar legislation could help bring more capacity to the market but this year has proven difficult in passing new legislation, according to Wood Mackenzie. ""The early expiration of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) will only add to this difficulty given the window for any new projects to secure tax credits is so small,"" said Connelly, adding: ""The passage of legislation in new markets could potentially add upwards of 1.1GW through 2030."" Connelly added that at the end of H1 2025, there was more than 9GW of community solar projects under development, with more than 1.4GW known to be under construction. ""This report makes clear the challenges ahead -- from federal uncertainty to interconnection delays and program caps -- that must be addressed to realise the full potential of community solar and deliver the resilient, affordable power communities are asking for,"" said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the CCSA. In related community solar news, the state of New Mexico saw its first community solar project commissioned. Located in Valencia County, the Cuidando Los Niños Community Solar Project was developed by solar installer Affordable Solar. Half of the project's energy production is reserved to support low-income households. Construction of the community solar project began in February of this year. The project is part of a seven-community solar portfolio awarded in the state. These projects have a combined capacity of 35MW. New Mexico signed legislation regarding a community solar programme back in 2021, which aimed to add 200MW of capacity and was then increased by 300MW last year, with an increased cap approved by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. ""This project proves that community solar works,"" said Cory Felder, Mountain West regional director for the CCSA. ""It delivers affordable power, local investment, and community benefits in a way no other clean energy program can.""",PV Tech,2025-10-01T10:20:23Z,https://www.pv-tech.org/obbba-to-slow-down-us-community-solar-installations-until-2030/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.439107,0.05098039215686279

"Meet actor who grew up in small village, used to collect cow dung, struggled for years, is now ruling OTT, has net worth of Rs..., he is...","Actor Jaideep Ahlawat, who once lived a simple village life in Haryana, is today one of Bollywood's most respected performers, owning luxury properties worth Rs 20 crore. Bollywood has seen many stars rise from humble beginnings, but Jaideep Ahlawat's story stands out for its raw honesty. Born in a small village in Haryana, he grew up amidst fields, cattle, and the fragrance of soil that still lingers in his heart. Today, after years of struggle and persistence, he has become one of the most versatile actors in the industry. His breakthrough came with Amazon Prime's Paatal Lok, which turned him into a household name. In a recent conversation with MenXP, Jaideep reflected on how far life has brought him. ""Sometimes I think about how much I have grown in life. Village life was wonderful; it was different but not difficult. There were no judgments and no worries of the world,"" he said. For Jaideep, the transition from a carefree village boy to a Bollywood actor in Mumbai was nothing short of dramatic. ""The difference between the village and Mumbai is huge. Sometimes it feels so overwhelming that it's hard to process. I have seen everything, from lifting cow dung to partying on the terrace of a 7-star hotel,"" he recalled. This contrast, he explained, gave him a treasure of references as an actor. ""I learned swimming by holding on to a cow's tail; that memory will always stay with me. But I've also lived a palace-like life, travelled the world, and absorbed new cultures. Now, I'm more aware of social and political issues. My references are powerful,"" Jaideep added. Despite his growing fame, Jaideep never forgets the hardships of his past. He lived in a 2BHK apartment for nearly 15 years before buying his dream house. ""When I bought my own house, my first thought was that next time I'll get a bigger one. That's human nature, we're never delighted,"" he admitted. His childhood, too, was modest. He revealed, ""Money was limited. We could only afford one pair of shoes a year. Even today, no matter how much I buy, somewhere inside I feel dissatisfied."" Jaideep's rise has not only brought him recognition but also immense financial success. Reports suggest that in June 2025, he purchased two luxury flats worth Rs 10 crore each in Mumbai's Andheri West, under the 'Poorna Apartments' project. Registered under his wife Jyoti Hooda's name, the total cost, including stamp duty and registration, crossed Rs 21.2 crore. This purchase, made within just two months, reflects his rapid financial growth. His net worth, once estimated at Rs 8 crore, skyrocketed after he reportedly charged Rs 20 crore for Paatal Lok 2, bringing his net worth close to Rs 28 crore. Beyond real estate, he also owns a Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV priced at Rs 1.32 crore, further cementing his status among Bollywood's successful names. After Paatal Lok, Jaideep continues to expand his horizons. He is set to appear in the much-anticipated next season of The Family Man, a series already known for its strong storytelling and performances. His journey proves that perseverance, patience, and passion can indeed turn humble beginnings into inspiring success stories.","India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com",2025-10-01T10:17:20Z,https://www.india.com/entertainment/meet-actor-who-grew-up-in-small-village-used-to-collect-cow-dung-struggled-for-years-is-now-ruling-ott-has-net-worth-of-rs-he-is-8108594-8108594/,2025-10-01 18:30:02.439742,0.1450980392156862

EURACTIV Press Release Site,"Steel industry and steel workers call for urgent action to restore a level playing field for the sector and stop the dramatic destruction of jobs and steel making capacity in Europe before it is too late. With Europe's steel industry at breaking point, industriAll Europe and the European Steel Association (EUROFER) held an emergency steel social summit to demand urgent action. Ahead of the announced Commission proposal addressing the impact of global steel excess capacity on the EU steel market, due by mid-October, the European social partners are united in calling for robust and effective trade measures. They also insist on fast and urgent implementation of the EU Steel and Metals Action Plan, especially concerning energy prices and demand. Maintaining the level of political ambition as promised in the EU Steel and Metals Action Plan is essential to restore steel's competitiveness and save its green transition as well as steelworkers' jobs across Europe. As the situation of the European steel industry is worsening due to unfair trade practises and high energy costs, the European steel social partners continue their calls for immediate EU action to ensure that the European steel sector can compete on a tough global market while transitioning to green steel production and keeping thousands of quality jobs in Europe. Global overcapacity at record highs, combined with energy and raw material prices at uncompetitive levels, have plunged the European steel sector into crisis, putting around 300,000 direct jobs and 2.3 million indirect jobs at risk. Only last year 18,000 layoffs were announced with a record 12 million tonnes of capacity closures, adding to the 100,000 job losses and 26 million tonnes of capacity closures between 2008 and 2023. This is why European steel social partners demand urgent EU action to safeguard the sector, its decarbonisation investments and thousands of jobs, before it's too late. Judith Kirton-Darling, industriAll Europe's General Secretary, said: ""Steel is the backbone of Europe's economy, yet the sector is now at breaking point. That is why trade unionists from every corner of Europe have joined steelmakers at this summit to call for urgent action. ""Supporting steel is not just about saving jobs in our mills. It is about safeguarding entire industrial value chains and ensuring consistency in Europe's industrial policy. The steel sector vitally needs Europe's backing, and steel workers across the continent stand ready to defend their industry."" Dr Henrik Adam, President of the European Steel Association (EUROFER), added: ""The European Union needs to act now, and decisively, before all lights go out in large parts of the EU steel industry and its value chains. Now more than ever, we need a new strong EU steel trade measure, competitive energy prices, and EU content provisions to ensure European steel's viability and transition. Executive Vice President Sejourne's participation in today's Emergency Steel Social Summit gives us confidence that the future of the EU steel industry and its workers is a high priority for the European Commission.""

Kenya's miraa black hole: Sh50m lost annually in undeclared exports,"The government could be losing more than Sh50 million annually in levies due to undeclared miraa destined for Somalia. According to Nyambene Miraa Trade Association (Nyamita), Kenya exports more than 40 tonnes of miraa daily, yet the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) only recorded an average of 20 tonnes. Following the enactment of the Miraa regulations, AFA charges Sh7 per kilo of miraa exported. AFA has in the past indicated that Kenya's miraa exports to Somalia are capped at 20 tonnes daily, following the market's reopening in July 2022. However, in February last year, Nyamita flagged government agencies, including the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), the Miraa, Pyrethrum and Other Industrial Crops Directorate (MPICD), and the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), for providing contradicting figures on the amount of miraa exported daily. Also Read: Tana River serves bitter Bill to miraa and muguka traders According to a report by KAA, seen by Daily Nation, 65,326 kilos of miraa were exported in July 2022, while AFA records indicated 118,600 kilograms, indicating a variance of more than 53,000 kilos. Further, AFA recorded 599,094 kilos of miraa were exported in July 2023, while KAA recorded 724,531 kilos in the same period, a difference of more than 125,000 kilos. The data by KAA was as provided by licensed Miraa handling sheds at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) while AFA gets its data from licensed exporters. JKIA handles between eight and 11 miraa cargo flights to Somalia daily. In a letter sent to the AFA Director General, Nyamita spokesman Kimathi Munjuri protested that under-declaration of miraa export volumes was hurting the sector through loss of public funds allocation. ""We request the MPICD to move with speed and find ways to receive the exact quantities of miraa shipped out of the country and share for informed decision making in government."" Nyamita spokesman Kimathi Munjuri stated. Also Read: No laws to regulate miraa, muguka and shisha, Health CS tells Senate committee However, the inquiry was never responded to, prompting the association to do a follow-up in April 2025. According to Mr Munjuri, the government may have lost well over Sh126 million between July 2022 and April 2025 to undeclared tonnage. ""We request the AFA to look into this matter and if our estimates are true, it points to a case of deliberate theft of government revenue, which is tantamount to economic sabotage of the country and the miraa subsector,"" Mr Munjuri states. But speaking to the Daily Nation, AFA Director General Bruno Linyiru said a review of the claims by the authority did not find any anomalies. ""The association has been basing its claim on the number of vehicles that ferry miraa out of Meru, yet not all of them end up in the export market. These claims are similar to the allegation that a 4.5USD commission is charged at the airport. We have records of all miraa that leaves Kenya and have not been able to lay our hands on any proof of the allegations,"" Dr Linyiru said. He, however, said the AFA would appreciate any leads that would enable them to verify the allegations. ""We would also want to get to the bottom of this matter because we need that revenue,"" he said. Nyamita now wants the matter proved and traders found culpable in the under-declaration scheme to be blacklisted and be compelled to pay back the lost revenue.",Nation,2025-10-01T10:20:28Z,https://nation.africa/kenya/business/kenya-s-miraa-black-hole-sh50m-lost-annually-in-undeclared-exports-5212944,2025-10-01 18:30:02.441129,-0.1294117647058823

Storm Amy named by Met Office with warnings of 'damaging' winds for five parts of Wales | Wales Online,"The Met Office has named the first storm of the 2024/25 season. Storm Amy is set to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the UK this weekend, with weather warnings being issued for five parts of Wales. The storm comes as the remnants of Hurricane Humberto makes its way across the Atlantic towards the UK. Forecasters at the Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for wind. The warning states: ""Strong winds are expected to batter the regions, arriving across the areas at around 7pm on Friday and will continue lashing until Sunday 12am."" The full list of areas affected in Wales are: Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd and Anglesey.

A befektetők továbbra is erőt tudtak meríteni az összességében kedvező amerikai gazdasági növekedési kilátásokból, még akkor is, ha a munkaerő-piac úgy tűnik, alacsonyabb fokozatba kapcsolt. Az amerikai jegybank fókusza így az inflációról egyre inkább a munkaerő-piaci helyzetre tevődik át, és ennek megfelelően kamatot is vágtak szeptemberi ülésükön. Ez az együttállás pedig - bíztató gazdasági növekedési kép, stabil vállalati eredmények és csökkenő kamatkörnyezet - jellemzően kedvez a részvénypiacoknak. Ezzel együtt az amerikai tőzsde továbbra is drágának számít a várható profitokhoz képest, így bármilyen, jelentősebb negatív hírre érzékenyebben reagálhatnak a börzék. Az amerikai kötvénypiacon némileg csökkentek a hozamszintek szeptember folyamán, felfelé hajtva a kötvényportfóliók értékét. A hónap végén a 10 éves amerikai államkötvény-hozamok 4,1% körül alakultak. A hazai kötvénybefektetők szintén jó hónapot zárhattak, a magyar államkötvény hozamok is mérséklődtek, szeptember végén 6.8% körül mozgott a 10 éves magyar államkötvények hozama.

'I'm a beauty writer and Debenhams' advent calendar got me over £550 worth of freebies' - The Mirror,"With beauty advent calendars popping up all over the high street, it can be hard to know which are worth the splurge. Iconic British retailer Debenhams has recently released its festive beauty offering which retails for £150, but contains skincare and makeup goodies worth over £700. As a beauty and shopping writer, I see many advent calendars each year, with a whole host of beauty options offering shoppers savings across big brands. I decided to unbox the Debenhams 2025 calendar to see if it's worth the price tag, or whether it's best left on the virtual shelves. : The advent calendar comes in a chic black design which I personally like, but some shoppers may prefer a less subtle approach to Christmas. The packaging is adorned with sketch-like images of some of the beauty brands inside, which is a nice touch. The calendar also contains a strong mixture of brands from MAC Cosmetics, Shiseido, and Estee Lauder to Lancome, Benefit, and Urban Decay. There's 25 doors to open and some contain more than one product, making it feel like a real treat to countdown to the 25th December with. The calendar contains a whopping 19 full-sized products, plus minis that are ideal for travel. One thing I look for in beauty advent calendars such as Debenhams' is the unboxing experience. I tend to think it feels more premium if there's boxes to remove rather than opening doors, and this calendar does exactly that. I also like that the boxes are sturdy as others can tend to be a little flimsy and prone to ripping as products are removed. Overall, the product selection is excellent in my opinion. Highlights for me include the suits-all viral Thanks It's Mac Lipstick which is full-sized. I often find makeup products (especially lipsticks for which taste is so personal) tricky in advent calendars as it's hard to find shades that will be used by most people. Thanks It's MAC is certainly one of those crowd-pleasers. The lipstick alone costs £25 to purchase when full price at Look Fantastic. I'm just as impressed with the mini Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum Synchronized Recovery Complex 7ml which normally retails for £18 at Boots. I'm also happy to see the inclusion of the Bare By Vogue Liquid Body Illuminator which is also currently shoppable at Boots for £24. Other beauty advent calendars I've got my eye on include Jo Malone's 25 Day Advent Calendar. At £360 it's pricey, but as fans will no doubt know, the brand's iconic fragrances don't come cheap. Inside there's everything from mini colognes to candles, so I reckon it would be a treaty gift for any perfume lovers. Another option that's on my wishlist is the Look Fantastic Calendar which retails for £105 but is worth £655. Containing sought-after brands such as Sol de Janeiro and MAC, it's bound to thrill many a makeup and skincare buff. At the more budget-friendly end of the scale, I like the look of the Yankee Candle Advent Wreath Set which retails for £27 at Boots. Featuring 24 winter tea lights in some of the brand's most famous scents (including Christmas Cookie and Christmas Eve), it's a more affordable yet still fun option. It seems a lot of thought has gone into the Debenhams Beauty Advent Calendar to ensure value for money and products that will actually be used. My one slight issue with beauty advents is that there's sometimes plenty of items I personally just wouldn't get much use out of, but I certainly don't feel that's the case with this one. A few drawbacks to mention include that the calendar isn't the most festive at first glance - this could be seen as a pro or a con depending on whether shoppers plan to reuse the packaging post Christmas. The calendar is also heavy, so beauty fans should be prepared for delivery and storage, and it may not be the best pick for someone who's short on space. At £150, it does also sit at the pricier end of the scale, but considering the brand names inside, I think there's going to be a lot included that beauty enthusiasts will love. Overall, the Debenhams advent calendar has surpassed my expectations. It would make a great gift for a beauty lover and it's certainly one of my favourite beauty picks to countdown to Christmas 2025. Ideal for someone who wants to try some new brands or stock up on their favourites, I think it'll be a hard one to beat this year.",Mirror,2025-10-01T10:11:37Z,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/im-beauty-writer-debenhams-advent-35983535,2025-10-01 18:30:05.623301,0.6313725490196078
"LG Electronics India's Rs 11,607-cr IPO to open on Oct 7; sets price band at Rs 1,080-1,140/share","New Delhi, Oct 1 (PTI) LG Electronics India Ltd, the Indian arm of South Korea's LG conglomerate, on Wednesday announced that its much-awaited Rs 11,607 crore initial public offering (IPO) will open for subscription on October 7, giving the valuation of around Rs 77,400 crore (USD 8.7 billion) The company's maiden public offering will be available for subscription until October 9 in the price range of Rs 1,080-1,140 per share. The bidding for anchor investors is scheduled for October 6, the company said in a public announcement. This will be the second South Korean company to tap the Indian stock market, following the listing of Hyundai Motors India Ltd in October last year. Also, this will be the third-largest IPO of 2025 after HDB Financial Services' Rs 12,500 crore in June and Tata Capital's Rs 15,500 crore public issue scheduled to open on October 6. LG Electronics India's IPO is entirely an offer-for-sale (OFS) of over 10.18 crore shares, representing about 15 per cent stake, by the South Korea-based parent. Since the public issue is completely an OFS, LG Electronics India will not receive any IPO proceeds. The funds raised will go to the South Korean parent. The IPO comes at a time when the Indian market is experiencing a boom in primary market activity, despite a struggling broader equity market. In 2025, a total of 77 companies have already tapped the mainboard market through IPOs, and several large issues are lined up for this month. LG Electronics India is a leading player in major home appliances and consumer electronics. Its products are sold to both B2C and B2B customers in India and abroad. It manufactures and sells products, including washing machines, refrigerators, LED TV panels, inverter air conditioners, and microwaves. Also, it provides installation, repair, and maintenance services for all its products. It has manufacturing units in Noida and Pune with an installed capacity of 1,45,10,000 products collectively. The company had an extensive supplier network comprising 287 suppliers as of June 30, 2025. On the financial front, LG Electronics India's revenue from operations was Rs 24,366.64 crore for FY25 compared to Rs 21,352 crore in the preceding year. Its net profit rose to Rs 2,203 crore from Rs 1,511 crore during the period. In terms of issue allocation, 50 per cent of the IPO is reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), 35 per cent for retail investors, and the remaining 15 per cent for non-institutional investors. Also, investors can place bids for a minimum of 13 shares and in multiples thereafter. LG Electronics India is expected to make its stock market debut on October 14. Morgan Stanley India, J P Morgan India, Axis Capital, BofA Securities India, and Citigroup Global Markets India are the book-running lead managers for the IPO.

How modern technologies and solutions can enhance piping design | Engineer Live,"Comprehensive technical expertise and coordination are needed when designing piping systems, as planners face complex challenges that require both modern technologies and planning solutions Piping systems are essential for transporting liquids, gases, and solids across various industries. Their reliability is of significant importance in reducing operational issues in the chemical, oil and gas, food, and energy sectors. Planning and designing piping systems is a complex process that involves multiple factors, including the type of media to be transported, pressure and temperature conditions, and corrosion resistance. Safety regulations and legal standards also play a vital role. Innovations such as those in 3D modelling and digital planning tools can provide advantages by enabling detailed visualisation of piping systems and helping to identify and rectify planning errors early on. Using 3D models can provide a realistic representation of the pipeline route and perform automated collision checks and layout optimisation, reducing planning errors and increasing planning reliability. Modern software solutions in piping design offer a range of integrated functions for creating P&ID diagrams and utilising the data in 3D design. Downstream processes, like the generation of parts lists and pipework isometrics, can be automated based on the 3D design. These tools aid engineers in developing precise and error-free planning documents, optimising material procurement and cost calculation. By utilising modern software solutions, such as M4 PLANT from CAD Schroer, planning errors can be minimised and efficiency increased, enabling piping design to meet the industry's growing demands and remain equipped for the future.",engineerlive.com,2025-10-01T10:00:28Z,https://www.engineerlive.com/node/24118,2025-10-01 18:30:05.624249,0.3098039215686275
"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA - Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. Recommended Videos ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",WDIV,2025-10-01T10:20:09Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com/tech/2025/10/01/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-this-year-the-fourth-biggest-retreat-on-record-experts-say/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.624663,-0.03529411764705881

Why has Starmer dropped Blair's university target?,"Last week, Keir Starner swallowed Tony Blair's argument for ID cards and announced that all we going to be forced to have them if we want a job, just as the former prime minister has been advocating for years. This week, however, the current PM has poured scorn on one of his predecessor's cherished policies, and ditched Blair's target for getting 50 per cent of young adults into higher education. Instead, Starmer yet again invoked his tool-making dad to argue that the target was wrong. It is to be replaced, he said, with a target of getting 75 per cent of young people into either university or on to a high quality apprenticeship. Given that Blair's target has already been reached - in 2022, 58 per cent of people had gone into higher education by the age of 25 - it is hard to see what the point is of dropping it now. Is Starmer saying: Blair's target was pointless in the first place and we're not the least bit proud of what we could be boasting of as a great Labour achievement? There will be many people who will sympathise with that point of view. The effects of Blair's arbitrary target are there for everyone to see: large numbers of graduates serving behind the counter in McDonald's, or other jobs that don't require a degree, while homeowners desperately search for skilled tradespeople to repair their kitchen sink. If we were going to have a target for getting people into higher education, it ought at least to have been based around getting people onto the right courses which were going to boost their chances of employment. Instead, we have had school-leavers being sucked onto fashionable humanities courses which qualify them for nothing in particular, except perhaps political activism. There certainly doesn't seem to be any positive correlation between the percentage of young people a country sends to university and its economic success: in the fast-growing US it is 43 per cent and in basket-case Greece it is 69 per cent. Nevertheless, the politics of Starmer's about-turn are fascinating. One group who won't have been pleased with Starmer's speech are academics and university administrators. For the PM to say that it is wrong to have a target of getting 50 per cent of people into university when, in fact, 58 per cent are already taking this route implies that he wants the university sector to shrink. Universities are already pleading financial hardship; while the government has this year granted them a modest, inflation-linked rise in the fees they are allowed to charge UK students, it was the first increase in eight years and some institutions have been warning about the sustainability of their finances. Unions have been bleating that 10,000 jobs are at risk as universities are forced to draw in their horns. There is possibly no bigger and stronger client group for the Labour party than academics. So why should Starmer choose to scorn them? If he wanted to boost the number of toolmakers' apprenticeships, he could always have set a target for them without changing, dropping or even mentioning the higher education target. Were I writing his speech, I would have had him boasting about having reached Blair's target, blasting the naysayers who said it couldn't be done, and then have him say something like: 'And now we want to boost apprenticeships so nearly all young people will be going into either higher education or apprenticeships. They are equally valid routes, and the choice is yours.' Instead, he questioned the whole worth of university education for the masses. While some may well agree, it is hard to see that it was good politics if you are the leader of the Labour party.",Spectator USA,2025-10-01T10:20:12Z,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-has-starmer-dropped-blairs-university-target/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.625840,-0.08235294117647063
"Korean pharma, biotech companies on alert after Trump vows 100% drug tariffs","Korean pharmaceutical and biotech companies are on edge after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration would impose a 100 percent tariff on imported medicines starting Wednesday. Trump made the pledge in a social media post on Sept. 26, saying, ""We will be imposing a 100 percent tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product."" The administration has not yet released details on how the policy would be implemented. This was not Trump's first warning. Earlier this year, he also flagged the possibility of tariffs on imported drugs. In July, he said his administration would introduce a 200 percent tariff after an 18-month grace period. The new figure of 100 percent is lower than what he announced in July, but industry officials say the policy would still significantly damage Korean exports if enforced. The United States is Korea's largest export destination for pharmaceuticals. Korean exports of medicines to the United States last year totaled 2.1 trillion won ($1.5 billion), outpacing the second-largest market, Hungary, by 340 billion won, according to data from the Korea Customs Service. Industry officials say Korean-made medicines would lose competitiveness if the Trump administration imposes tariffs by executive order. Under existing trade agreements, countries such as Japan and members of the European Union are subject to only 15 percent duties under most-favored-nation rules. ""If high tariffs become a reality, exports to the United States will inevitably decline,"" a Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association official said. ""Since no detailed schedule has been released, the industry is waiting to see what President Trump decides."" Biopharmaceutical companies, which account for 63.4 percent of Korea's U.S.-bound drug exports, have already started stockpiling inventories in the United States. ""We more than doubled shipments to the United States earlier this year because President Trump has repeatedly warned of high tariffs on imported medicines,"" an official at a Korean biopharmaceutical firm said. Some Korean companies are also establishing production bases in the United States, as President Trump pressures foreign companies to invest in the country, warning that Washington would impose tariffs ""unless a company is building their pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in America."" Celltrion announced on Sept. 23 that it will acquire a biopharmaceutical plant in Branchburg, New Jersey, in a deal worth $330 million. The company said the decision reflects concerns over escalating tariff barriers. Lotte Biologics acquired a plant in Syracuse, New York, in 2023. SK Biopharm secured a contract manufacturer in Puerto Rico, while Samsung Biologics is considering acquiring a U.S. plant. Industry voices argue that negotiations between Seoul and Washington are the only viable solution. ""Korean biosimilars are important in U.S. efforts to lower drug prices and stabilize supply chains, so this could become a bargaining chip in tariff talks,"" a pharmaceutical industry source said. Some analysts warn that the policy could have wider global effects. Trump has pledged to bring U.S. drug prices down to the lowest in the world and is pressuring multinational drugmakers to comply. Pfizer announced a price cut on Tuesday in response, and other major pharmaceutical companies are expected to follow.

Baroness Michelle Mone-linked company loses £122m High Court battle with government over faulty PPE,"A company linked to Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone has lost a High Court battle with the government over a £122 million pandemic deal for PPE gowns which turned out to be faulty . PPE Medpro agreed to supply 25 million surgical gowns to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in the early stages of the pandemic, in a deal struck through the controversial VIP lane for Covid contracts. But the products that were supplied turned out to not be sterile and were deemed unfit for use. The government sued in a bid to recover the costs of the £122 million contract as well as £8 million in storage costs, while Medpro opted to fight the case. And in a judgment delivered on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Cockerill ordered Medpro to pay back the full £122m cost of the gowns contract, finding the company liable for three breaches of contract. She found the gowns supplied by Medpro were faulty and not sterile, and the NHS had ""no need"" for the product. The judge rejected the government's claim for storage costs. In a summary of the ruling, the judge said the government is ""entitled to the price of the gowns as damages"". ""This was because the gowns could not be used as sterile gowns, the alternative was to use them as non-sterile gowns, however the NHS had no need for such gowns and the evidence showed no reasonable market for the gowns outside the NHS due to regulatory and procurement constraints"". Mr Barrowman reacted instantly to the judgment by labelling it a ""travesty of justice"". Ahead of the ruling, PPE Medpro filed a ""notice of appointment to appoint an administrator"", in a move that could thwart the government's retrieval of money. And Lady Mone herself launched an astonishing attack on Ministers on social media, suggesting that she and her husband had been made the ""poster couple for the PPE scandal"" to distract from wider anger at the VIP contracts lane set up by Boris Johnson's government at the start of the Covid pandemic. ""For the past seven months, I have stayed silent. But the truth is, I have endured five years of pure torture, relentless press and media attacks, every single day, without responding"", she wrote. ""Enough is enough. It is time for the public to know the truth."" Lady Mone and her husband previously issued firm denials that they were linked to Medpro, and engaged lawyers to issue legal threats against those who suggested that was untrue. Eventually, they were forced to admit that Mr Barrowman is heavily involved in the managing consortium, while he and his wife benefitted to the tune of £60 million from the PPE deal. The National Crime Agency launched a criminal investigation into the MedPro deal in 2021, and last year it was revealed that assets worth a reported £75 million - including a Belgravia townhouse, an estate on the Isle of Man, and 15 bank accounts - have been frozen by investigators. In the ruling, Mrs Justice Cockerill also rejected Medpro's counter claim that the government had neglected its contractual duties during the deal, saying it ""fails on multiple levels"". She said Medpro's argument that it relied on the DHSC for advice was ""utterly unrealistic"". ""Medpro was presenting itself to DHSC as a worthy entrant into the fast lane for approval as a supplier and aiming to land contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds of public money. ""It said repeatedly that it had experience. It claimed to be well established: Mr Barrowman's years of experience were trumpeted, as was its track record 'manufacturing large quantities for the Australian government'."" In her social media outburst, Lady Mone complained about editing in TV documentaries on the scandal, and suggested that the government has chosen to go after Medpro in court to distract from failings within the DHSC. ""This case was never about gowns or money"", she wrote. ""It has always been about politics and blame-shifting, a way to cover up the Government's disastrous £10 billion PPE write-off. ""Doug and I have been deliberately scapegoated and vilified in an orchestrated campaign designed to distract from catastrophic mismanagement of PPE procurement. ""The Government decided to make us the poster couple for the PPE scandal, a convenient distraction to take the blame off them. ""Meanwhile, the public can see with their own eyes images of PPE worth billions dumped in fields and warehouses across the country. That is the real scandal."" Lady Mone may also have landed herself in trouble with the High Court, after she posted images of letters sent to the government during the legal dispute and claimed that Medpro had tried, unsuccessfully, to settle the case on a ""no fault"" basis with a multimillion payment. In court documents from May this year, the DHSC said the gowns were delivered to the UK in 72 lots between August and October 2020, with £121,999,219.20 paid to PPE Medpro between July and August that year. The department rejected the gowns in December 2020 and told the company it would have to repay the money, but this has not happened, and the gowns remain in storage, unable to be used. During the trial, Paul Stanley KC, for the DHSC, said 99.9999% of the gowns should have been sterile under the terms of the contract, equating to one in a million being unusable. The DHSC claims the contract also specified PPE Medpro had to sterilise the gowns using a ""validated process"", attested by CE marking, which indicates a product has met certain medical standards. Mr Stanley said ""none of those things happened"", with no validated sterilisation process being followed, and the gowns supplied with invalid CE marking. He also said that 140 gowns were later tested for sterility, with 103 failing. Charles Samek KC, for PPE Medpro, said at the close of the trial that the Government had ordered 10 years' worth of excess gowns by December 2020 and that it was suffering from ""buyer's remorse"". He said the DHSC approved the gowns without seeing a valid CE mark and that PPE Medpro ""did not pretend"" to have one because it did not need it. After delivery, the gowns were kept in shipping containers for ""at least three months"", he added, and that contamination likely occurred ""most probably during the subsequent transportation, storage and handling of the tested gowns"". In a statement issued after the ruling, Mr Barrowman attacked the judge's ruling as a ""whitewash"" and claimed it was an ""establishment win on a case that was too big for the Government to lose"". ""Today, a travesty of justice took place following the judgement of Lady Justice Cockerill"", his spokesperson wrote, in a pre-prepared statement. ""She gave the DHSC an Establishment win despite the mountain of evidence in court against such a judgement. ""Her judgement bears little resemblance to what actually took place during the month long trial, where PPE Medpro convincingly demonstrated that its gowns were sterile. ""This judgement is a whitewash of the facts and shows that justice was being seen to be done, where the outcome was always certain for the DHSC and the government. This case was simply too big for the government to lose."" The judge ordered that the government is refunded the contract cost by October 15.",Yahoo News,2025-10-01T10:10:55Z,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/baroness-michelle-mone-linked-company-095021117.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.627825,-0.1529411764705882

New woodland between four Kent villages to open to public,"A ""beautiful"" new woodland is to be planted between four Kent villages - and will open to the public. Forestry England has bought a 163-acre site 10 miles west of Ashford as it aims to ""expand the nation's forests"". The site - which sits between Smarden, Bethersden, High Halden and Biddenden - will include a ""mix of tree species"". Bosses say they will create a ""beautiful space for people to enjoy"" that will also provide ""a sustainable source of timber"". They will now begin surveying the existing farmland - which includes a number of ponds - before creating initial designs. Residents will be invited to share their views on the design of the woodland before a formal public consultation is held in the spring. Dan Whyment, forest management director at Forestry England, says the government agency is ""delighted"" to have secured the land, which is divided by Bethersden Road. ""We now begin the exciting work of creating a beautiful, resilient woodland that will fit well with the other forests we manage in this part of the county of Kent,"" he said. ""This new woodland is one of many we are creating across England to expand the nation's forests, with support from the government's Nature for Climate Fund.""",Kent Online,2025-10-01T10:12:28Z,https://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/new-woodland-between-four-kent-villages-to-open-to-public-330549/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.628602,0.4274509803921569
EURACTIV Press Release Site,"Steel industry and steel workers call for urgent action to restore a level playing field for the sector and stop the dramatic destruction of jobs and steel making capacity in Europe before it is too late. With Europe's steel industry at breaking point, industriAll Europe and the European Steel Association (EUROFER) held an emergency steel social summit to demand urgent action. Ahead of the announced Commission proposal addressing the impact of global steel excess capacity on the EU steel market, due by mid-October, the European social partners are united in calling for robust and effective trade measures. They also insist on fast and urgent implementation of the EU Steel and Metals Action Plan, especially concerning energy prices and demand. Maintaining the level of political ambition as promised in the EU Steel and Metals Action Plan is essential to restore steel's competitiveness and save its green transition as well as steelworkers' jobs across Europe. As the situation of the European steel industry is worsening due to unfair trade practises and high energy costs, the European steel social partners continue their calls for immediate EU action to ensure that the European steel sector can compete on a tough global market while transitioning to green steel production and keeping thousands of quality jobs in Europe. Global overcapacity at record highs, combined with energy and raw material prices at uncompetitive levels, have plunged the European steel sector into crisis, putting around 300,000 direct jobs and 2.3 million indirect jobs at risk. Only last year 18,000 layoffs were announced with a record 12 million tonnes of capacity closures, adding to the 100,000 job losses and 26 million tonnes of capacity closures between 2008 and 2023. This is why European steel social partners demand urgent EU action to safeguard the sector, its decarbonisation investments and thousands of jobs, before it's too late. Judith Kirton-Darling, industriAll Europe's General Secretary, said: ""Steel is the backbone of Europe's economy, yet the sector is now at breaking point. That is why trade unionists from every corner of Europe have joined steelmakers at this summit to call for urgent action. ""Supporting steel is not just about saving jobs in our mills. It is about safeguarding entire industrial value chains and ensuring consistency in Europe's industrial policy. The steel sector vitally needs Europe's backing, and steel workers across the continent stand ready to defend their industry."" Dr Henrik Adam, President of the European Steel Association (EUROFER), added: ""The European Union needs to act now, and decisively, before all lights go out in large parts of the EU steel industry and its value chains. Now more than ever, we need a new strong EU steel trade measure, competitive energy prices, and EU content provisions to ensure European steel's viability and transition. Executive Vice President Sejourne's participation in today's Emergency Steel Social Summit gives us confidence that the future of the EU steel industry and its workers is a high priority for the European Commission.""

Coffee farmer wants better price for her beans,"Ellis examines one of her coffee trees, which is ready for harvesting. Five acres of fully grown berries are now ready for harvesting, but coffee farmer Dian Ellis of Hart Hill, Portland, is facing what feels like insurmountable challenges. Ellis, who spoke to THE STAR on Tuesday from her farm in Fairfield in the Buff Bay valley, explained that she relies on coffee farming, even though it requires a lot of hard work, including clearing the land, tilling it, planting seeds, fertilising, and then cleaning around the plants, so as to ensure full growth. ""It's harvest time now so we employ people to go out in the morning to pick the berries, which are placed in a box. Workers are paid $3,000 per box for the berries that they pick or reap,"" said Ellis. ""We as farmers are paid $10,000 per box for our berries by the coffee buyers. So right away you can easily realise our plight. ""From the outset, people are hired to clear the land right up to planting, fertilising, and then to reap during harvest. And we have to ensure that plants are not consumed by bushes or shrubbery."" Ellis expressed hope that farmers like her will get a better price for their coffee. ""It is very costly to maintain the coffee. Fertiliser is very expensive and that is what is affecting every coffee farmer,"" she said. ""The cost for fertilisers is about $10,000 per bag. On my farm I will use about 25 bags each time and I fertilise like three times per year."" But in addition to those issues, there are other challenges facing Ellis. ""We have some challenges as it relates to a large breakaway from the community of Bangor Ridge coming down, which makes the road inaccessible. I really need help with the road as a result of the breakaway at the Malava Bridge, which prevents us from driving through right to Bangor Ridge. As for my farm, where it used to be, I could drive and go straight on the farm, but because of that blockage, you have to walk a long way [about a mile and a half]. And like now, when it's reaping time, you have to pay people to carry out the berries on their heads,"" she added. Frequent rainfall in the Buff Bay valley is a perennial problem plaguing that area, as, according to Ellis, even though restoration road repairs are carried out, landslides triggered by heavy downpours continue to impact several roadways, especially farm roads in the Buff Bay valley of west Portland. ""I am passionate about what I do, and my husband is very supportive. It is a good feeling for me and I enjoy what I am doing. But I am hoping that the price for coffee per box, will go up, so that we can see some light,"" she said.",The Jamaica Star,2025-10-01T10:19:33Z,http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20251001/coffee-farmer-wants-better-price-her-beans,2025-10-01 18:30:05.630023,0.3568627450980393
Listed Indian Real Estate Developers Healthy Despite Market Headwinds: Report,"New Delhi: Despite various unfavourable developments, the relevant market for listed real estate developers is still healthy, and the second quarter of the current financial year (Q2 FY26) could bring back investor interest, changing the perception and a report said on Wednesday. High-level industry data till August suggests that volume demand increased year-on-year (YoY), although on a low base, it was impacted by elections last year. Meanwhile, launches were still slow as developers avoided the inauspicious days during the quarter. ""Yet our checks suggest that our covered developers combined pre-sales grew 64 per cent YoY,"" HSBC Global Investment Research said in a report. The new launches largely received a strong response, allowing them to sell a significant part of the projects during the period. According to the report, the sustenance sales were supportive and will be further supported by strong collections. ""We remain constructive on top residential developers. Pricing environment and upgrade demand in the premium segment (target market for listed developers) remain buoyant and support margins,"" the report stated. Low unsold inventory and strong balance sheet, coupled with large real estate regulatory authority (RERA) cash balances, continue to generate confidence among the home buyers, the report added. Large developers continue to gain market share driven by their ability to execute large and premium projects (which are in high demand). Domestic press and influencers have been very negative on Indian residential real estate. All three large markets have been impacted by the shadow of negativity. Additionally, the headline numbers also indicated a 15 per cent YoY decline in units sold in Q1 FY26. ""From a narrative perspective, while the National Capital Region (NCR) has been termed fragile and speculative, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) is expected to be oversupplied with redevelopment projects, and Bengaluru is too weak on IT job losses and the potential threat of artificial intelligence (AI),"" the report noted.",Zee News,2025-10-01T10:19:57Z,https://zeenews.india.com/real-estate/listed-indian-real-estate-developers-healthy-despite-market-headwinds-report-2966857.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.630400,0.3803921568627451
"3% DA hike for central government employees, pensioners ahead of Dussehra, Diwali","New-Delhi: Ahead of festivals such as Dussehra and Diwali, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a 3 per cent hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) for central government employees and pensioners. ""The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved to release an additional instalment of Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to pensioners w.e.f 01.07.2025 representing an increase of 3% over the existing rate of 55% of the Basic Pay/Pension, to compensate against price rise,"" the Cabinet said in a statement issued on Wednesday. The hike, once approved by the Union Cabinet, will take retrospective effect from July 1. And, if approved, it will be the second hike this year; in March a two per cent increase was announced, taking DA payouts from 53 per cent of basic pay to 55 per cent. And that was four months after another hike - in October last year - of three per cent. The increase covers all Central government employees under the 7th Pay Commission, as well as pensioners and family pensioners.

"Union Cabinet Approves 3% DA Hike For 49.19 Lakh Central Government Employees And 68.72 Lakh Pensioners Effective October 2025; Annual Financial Impact Rs 10,083.96 Crore","New Delhi: The Union Cabinet has approved a 3 percent increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) for central government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners, effective from October 1, 2025. The decision aims to protect employees and pensioners from rising inflation and maintain their purchasing power. The hike will be added to the existing DA rate of 55 percent of basic pay or pension. Approximately 49.19 lakh central government employees and 68.72 lakh pensioners are set to benefit from this move. The increase follows the formula recommended by the 7th Central Pay Commission, which links DA adjustments to the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW). The total annual financial impact of this DA and DR increase on the government's budget is estimated at Rs 10,083.96 crore. This expenditure reflects the government's commitment to ensuring that its workforce and retired employees continue to receive compensation aligned with the cost of living. Earlier in 2025, the Cabinet had approved a 2 percent DA increase, bringing the rate to 55 percent effective from January 1, 2025. The latest 3 percent hike builds on that adjustment, providing further relief to employees and pensioners amid ongoing inflationary pressures. The revised DA and DR rates will be applicable from October 1, 2025, and employees and pensioners can expect the updated amounts in their upcoming payments, subject to processing timelines of respective departments. The government's decision highlights its commitment to supporting its workforce systematically and transparently. By following the established formula for DA calculation, it ensures fairness while addressing economic realities. As economic conditions continue to evolve, further adjustments to DA and DR may be considered in future Cabinet meetings. Employees and pensioners are advised to stay updated through official communications for any subsequent changes.",Zee News,2025-10-01T10:19:32Z,https://zeenews.india.com/personal-finance/union-cabinet-approves-3-da-hike-for-49-19-lakh-central-government-employees-and-68-72-lakh-pensioners-effective-october-2025-annual-financial-impact-rs-10083-96-crore-2966860.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.630972,0.4431372549019608
Cops say St Thomas is a drug-trafficking hub,"Intelligence gathered by the police suggests that the frequency of drug busts in St Thomas is largely due to the parish's proximity to Haiti, according to Acting Senior Superintendent of Police Patrae Rowe, director of the Firearms and Narcotics Investigation Division. Rowe explained to THE STAR that St Thomas and neighbouring parish Portland ""have been our most problematic areas in terms of the transshipment of drugs"". ""We have shown that both parishes, and Westmoreland to a lesser extent, represent launching points for ganja to Haiti,"" Rowe said. His comments follow two major seizures in St Thomas in just over a week. On September 26, police intercepted two motor cars on Pamphret main road, seizing more than 1,600 pounds of compressed ganja. Two men, identified as Rayon Chambers of Whitehouse, Westmoreland, and Tekashi Foster of Slipe, St Elizabeth, were arrested and charged. Then on September 21, cops seized more than 1,900 pounds of ganja and a boat in Dumfries. Rowe noted that while the coastline provides opportunities for traffickers, the real factor is geography. ""I think it's a matter of proximity to Haiti... when people are coming in from Haiti they normally arrive in Portland, and that has to do with that side of the island being close to Haiti. The population of Haitians in that side of the island is also reflective of the traffic of people and activities from Haiti to Jamaica through those parishes,"" he said. Despite ongoing busts, Rowe admitted that it's a tough battle. ""The JDF and JCF combined have sought to have controlled coastlines. The JCF has a presence in St Thomas, they have a marine outpost there, JDF Coast Guard has an active presence, the US Coast Guard outside of Jamaica's coastline has a presence, and they have been doing some interception in recent times,"" Rowe told THE STAR. But traffickers are not amateurs. According to Rowe, fishermen often use their intimate knowledge of the seas to outwit patrols. ""Sometimes you have instances of fisherfolks studying the patrol pattern of police and coast guard and finding ways to manoeuvre. A lot of the transshipment takes place late at night... night transshipment reduces visibility on the seas,"" he explained. According to the 2024 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, Jamaica remains the largest Caribbean supplier of cannabis to the United States, with the illicit trade valued in the billions globally. Local authorities continue to link drug smuggling to the illegal guns-for-drugs trade, which fuels violence in several communities. Still, Rowe insists that law enforcement agencies are tightening the net. ""It's not for a lack of effort on the part of the police,"" he said. ""But as you can appreciate, Jamaica is an island, and there are a number of entry and exit points.""",The Jamaica Star,2025-10-01T10:19:33Z,http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20251001/cops-say-st-thomas-drug-trafficking-hub,2025-10-01 18:30:05.631437,-0.01960784313725494
"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",The Independent,2025-10-01T10:12:32Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/swiss-geneva-europe-glaciers-zurich-b2837186.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.631782,-0.05882352941176472
Kroger recall as warning issued for products in 17 states,"Six frozen-food items sold at Kroger stores across 17 states have been recalled amid a federal health warning about possible contamination with pieces of wood. The products -- ranging from popular State Fair corn dogs to Jimmy Dean pancake and sausage sticks -- are being removed from shelves after multiple injury complaints, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Food recalls of this scale are critical tools in protecting public health. In this case, the presence of wood fragments in processed meat products presents a risk of oral injury or choking. Contaminants like wood, metal, or plastic are among the leading causes of food recalls in the U.S. Because such materials can be difficult to detect once products are frozen, widespread recalls help prevent potentially serious harm to consumers, especially children, who are a common audience for corn dog and pancake stick products. The USDA's classification of the recall as Class I -- indicating a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences -- highlights the urgency of removing affected products from the shelves. The recalled items include six specific products manufactured by Hillshire Brands, a subsidiary of Tyson Foods: State Fair Beef Corn Dogs 12-count (32 oz); State Fair Corn Dogs 16-count (42.72 oz); State Fair Fiesta Cheese Jalapeño Corn Dogs (4 oz); State Fair Corn Dogs 6-count (16 oz); Jimmy Dean Sausage Pancake Stick 12-count (12/2.5 oz); and Jimmy Dean Blueberry Pancake Sausage on a Stick 12-count (12/2.5 oz). These items were sold at Kroger and affiliated banners including Dillons, Baker's, Gerbes, King Soopers, City Market, Fry's, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, QFC, Smith's, Food 4 Less and Foods Co., with distribution covering major portions of the Midwest, South, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic region. Nationwide, the full recall affects approximately 58 million pounds of food products manufactured by Hillshire Brands between March 17 and September 26, 2025. In addition to retail sales, some of these items were distributed to schools and Department of Defense facilities, although the USDA noted that the school distribution was not part of the National School Lunch Program. All recalled products carry establishment numbers ""EST-582"" or ""P-894"", printed on the packaging. Consumers should check use-by dates and return any affected items to the point of purchase or discard them. Full lists of affected products and labels are posted on the FSIS website. Consumers are encouraged to monitor updates from FSIS and check their freezers.

Major French Bank Societe Generale Introduces Euro and Dollar Stablecoins,"Synopsis- Societe Generale's digital asset subsidiary, SG-FORGE, has introduced its euro and dollar stablecoins on leading Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Uniswap and Morpho. This move allows users around the world to lend, borrow, and trade these bank-regulated tokens 24/7 using smart contracts that replace traditional intermediaries. On the Morpho platform, users can lend and borrow SG-FORGE's stablecoins EURCV and USDCV against popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. They can also use tokenized money market funds backed by US and Eurozone Treasury Bills as collateral. Asset management firm MEV Capital oversees the vaults, setting lending rules and managing any defaults to keep the system secure. This lending market offers regulated, institutional-grade options, bridging traditional finance with decentralized blockchain protocols. The stablecoins are fully backed by segregated fiat reserves, complying with European regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Simultaneously, the bank's stablecoins are now available for spot trading on Uniswap's decentralized exchange. Market maker Flowdesk provides liquidity to facilitate smooth swapping of EURCV and USDCV against tokens like Ethereum without relying on centralized exchanges. This open market access allows traders and investors to move stablecoins freely at any time. Though the market caps of EURCV and USDCV $66 million and $32.2 million respectively are small compared to major players like Tether's USDT, their integration into DeFi marks a growing acceptance of regulated stablecoins by institutional users.

SG-FORGE manages its stablecoins with strong security measures, including audits by expert firms and the use of Chainlink oracles for price feeds. Both EURCV and USDCV maintain a strict 1:1 peg to their respective fiat currencies and are issued as Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) under MiCA rules. This guarantees redeemability, transparency, and AML compliance. By aligning with French and European regulations, SG-FORGE positions these stablecoins as trusted alternatives to unregulated competitors, attracting users seeking security and regulatory certainty in DeFi. This deployment signifies a key step in merging traditional banking with decentralized finance. Société Générale, a leading European bank, pioneers regulated stablecoins directly in DeFi, opening new use cases for cross-border payments, yield generation, and collateralized lending. CEO Jean-Marc Stenger describes this move as the next natural phase in stablecoin growth. With plans to onboard more platforms and increase types of acceptable collateral, SG-FORGE aims to expand adoption steadily.

UK manufacturing activity shrinks at fastest pace for five months,"Activity in the UK manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace for five months in September after orders dropped, according to new figures. The downturn came as firms linked to the car industry also warned that their supply chains were affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 46.2 for the month, decreasing from 47.0 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting. The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. It was in line with economist expectations for the month. The survey showed a reduction in both domestic demand and export orders for the month as companies highlighted ""challenging"" market sentiment. Manufacturers said they scaled back production as a result, marking the 11th consecutive month of declining production. Worsening market conditions were also linked to weaker client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and higher costs. Employment in the sector also slumped again, with companies reporting that they reduced headcount to offset higher costs following increases to the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. ""Manufacturers are facing an increasingly challenging environment, with intakes of new business and levels of production hit by weak market sentiment, a dearth of new export work and a high-cost environment exacerbated by tax and labour cost rises. ""Companies entwined into the autos supply chain are also facing a temporary hit to activity following the cyber-attack on JLR."" Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The weakness in September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) may be exaggerated by businesses' concerns over tax rises at the upcoming Autumn Budget and temporary factory closures in the automotive sector. ""However, the sector certainly faces weak domestic and external demand as it navigates slowing real income growth, tightening fiscal policy, and a global economy that is still getting to grips with higher US tariffs.""",Lynn News,2025-10-01T10:18:52Z,https://www.lynnnews.co.uk/national/uk-manufacturing-activity-shrinks-at-fastest-pace-for-five-months-155849/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.634002,-0.1294117647058823
"RBI Keeps Repo Rate Unchanged At 5.5%, Maintains Neutral Stance","A neutral stance implies that the central bank neither seeks to stimulate the economy nor tighten liquidity, balancing efforts to control inflation without impeding growth. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent, with the monetary policy committee (MPC) maintaining a ""neutral"" policy stance. A neutral stance implies that the central bank neither seeks to stimulate the economy nor tighten liquidity, balancing efforts to control inflation without impeding growth. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the inflation outlook has become more benign due to a sharp decline in food prices and recent GST rate cuts. The RBI has revised its average inflation projection for 2025-26 to 2.6 per cent from the 3.1 per cent projected in August. On growth, the MPC has raised its GDP forecast to 6.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent earlier, citing robust domestic demand, a good monsoon, the impact of earlier monetary easing, and GST rate reductions. The Governor noted that the central bank is waiting for the effects of previous policy measures to fully play out and for trade-related implications to unfold. ""It would be prudent to wait for the policy actions to play out before charting out the next round of monetary policy actions,"" he said. Since February this year, the RBI has reduced the repo rate by 100 basis points. Lower rates, combined with increased liquidity, are expected to reduce borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, encouraging consumption and investment. The effectiveness of these cuts, however, depends on how efficiently commercial banks transmit the benefits to borrowers.",Afternoon Voice,2025-10-01T08:09:08Z,https://www.afternoonvoice.com/rbi-keeps-repo-rate-unchanged-at-5-5-maintains-neutral-stance.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.634260,0.07450980392156858

On digital locking of phones bought on credit, the Deputy Governor said the matter was under consideration. RBI Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao added that both pros and cons regarding the digital locking of phones are being examined. Highlighting the future prospects of India's economy and tax structure, the deputy governor said that ""the issue of digital locking is under examination, as the governor has pointed out. There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and creditors' requirements. So, we are examining the issue; we will...take a view at a later point in time,"" as per PTI. During the press conference, Malhotra and other deputy governors replied to a host of queries, including on rate cut possibilities in forthcoming policies and rupee depreciation. On the rate cut, the governor highlighted that the inflation has dropped considerably, providing space for monetary easing. On the depreciating value of the rupee against the US dollar, the RBI governor asserted that the central bank does not target any level or band but only tries to check undue volatility. Malhotra also exuded confidence that the very high GDP growth trajectory will continue with price stability, and private capital expenditure will pick up. The RBI Governor further emphasised that the RBI raised the GDP growth projection to 6.8 per cent for the current fiscal year from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent because of good economic activities in the first half of 2025-26.",mid-day,2025-10-01T10:19:05Z,https://www.mid-day.com/news/india-news/article/no-additional-charges-on-upi-rbi-confirms-after-monetary-policy-meeting-23596707,2025-10-01 18:30:05.634579,-0.01960784313725494

The Labour Conference's 'Big Construction Debate' tackles issues within the industry,"Several UK construction leaders gathered at the Labour Conference yesterday to discuss the skills gap, productivity issues, and the 1.5m new homes target The Big Construction Debate discussed several major issues plaguing the construction industry, and how to address them or boost them. The debate was carried out over several sessions, with two major sessions addressing the skills shortage and low delivery rates of housing. Speakers at the conference included: In the debate, five key policy asks were made of the government: Earlier this month, LRG's managing director of land and new homes, Tim Foreman, wrote a commentary that laid out some wishes for government action ahead of the conference. The policy asks made in the conference largely agree with the preceding list. However, some have not been addressed by these asks, such as helping buyers to purchase homes, supporting demand and delivery of new homes. Tim wrote: ""There are immediate steps that the new secretary of state could take. First, he must restore demand from first-time buyers. While we don't advocate an exact return of Help to Buy is clear, the fact is that it supported nearly 40% of all sales for some housebuilders and benefited thousands of first time buyers. An improved equity loan scheme could give young buyers a realistic route into ownership, unlock chains, and generate wider economic benefits. ""The mortgage guarantee scheme has been made permanent, but take-up is limited and awareness low. A more ambitious scheme, better promoted, could achieve much more. ""In the realm of new builds, tax reform is overdue. While new builds themselves are zero-rated for VAT, many associated costs still attract VAT.

eBay launches new AI productivity programme worth over £3m to upskill small businesses | Wales Online,"A new programme worth over £3 million to skill-up small UK businesses with fully funded access to the latest custom AI productivity tools and training to free up time and boost growth has been launched by eBay. Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, the programme is open to all businesses which sell on eBay with up to 10,000 to be onboarded this year. With small businesses accounting for three-fifths of UK employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector, equipping them with the technology and skills to compete is critical to deliver growth. The programme will offer access to ChatGPT Enterprise for up to 12 months in addition to tailored training to help unlock its potential. Additional support will include a dedicated eBay team who will engage with sellers to develop custom GPTs which will be most beneficial to growing small businesses on eBay and beyond. There is strong appetite for using AI among UK small businesses, but also a need for assistance in applying it to achieve business impact. While 69% of online businesses feel excited (43%) or curious (26%) about AI's potential, many are still working out how to make best use of the technology for them. Broader AI adoption could deliver a step change in UK productivity, with the IMF estimating that the technology could add as much as £470 billion to GDP by 2035. eBay is the first online marketplace to provide OpenAI's tools and relevant training free to its small business customers. The training programme has been designed using insights from seller research and interviews which identified the greatest opportunities for AI to free up time and increase productivity. These include sessions on managing financial analysis, creating promotional campaigns and effective research. Training will take place virtually as well as moving to in-person sessions in 2026. Eve Williams, General Manager, eBay UK, said: ""The issue is no longer whether businesses should adopt AI. ""It is how quickly they can start before their competitors do. Those businesses and economies that don't invest in AI now risk being left behind. That's why eBay is investing to put world-class AI in the hands of small businesses and entrepreneurs, with no charge to them. ""We want British small businesses to win nationally and globally which means that the latest AI tools cannot be the preserve of big business. They should be in the hands of every small business in Britain."" Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Chief AI Officer, eBay, said: ""AI is reshaping ecommerce and eBay is all-in. We see this as a generational opportunity to reimagine buying and selling for our customers, powered by three decades of marketplace insights and cutting-edge models. ""With AI Activate, we're extending that vision to small businesses and making sure that they don't have to figure this out alone. Giving small businesses the same tools and advantages as big retailers means that they can innovate and grow to capitalise on the AI era."" The launch of eBay AI Activate reflects a broader focus for the company on capitalising on AI, with artificial intelligence now embedded at the heart of the business. eBay has already invested in equipping its employees with ChatGPT Enterprise globally, focusing on its use to enhance team creativity, exploration and productivity. Across the platform, more than 10 million sellers worldwide have used eBay's generative AI tools to create over 300 million listings, contributing several billion dollars of GMV, with more than 500,000 new listings generated every day. Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist at OpenAI commented: ""Small businesses power the UK economy, accounting for over 99% of the UK's firms. Yet for too long, they have not had the tools to drive increases in productivity the way larger firms do. ""This collaboration could change that. By putting world-class AI tools in the hands of 10,000 UK entrepreneurs, we're investing in the UK's economic engine. If we want to close the productivity gap, this is where to start.""",WalesOnline,2025-10-01T10:09:11Z,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/ebay-launches-new-ai-productivity-32586482,2025-10-01 18:30:05.635926,0.4352941176470588
Buy HIMS Stock At $56?,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Hims & Hers stock (NASDAQ: HIMS) has recently witnessed a remarkable rebound, climbing 42% over the last month from approximately $42 to its current price of $59. This significant increase is primarily due to the announcement that a U.S. federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Eli Lilly against a rival telehealth company, Willow Health, on September 2, 2025. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly had initiated a lawsuit against Willow Health along with three other telehealth companies concerning the sale of compounded versions of tirzepatide. This ingredient is found in Lilly's branded weight-loss medications, Zepbound and Mounjaro. Hims & Hers itself is facing class-action complaints from investors and significant regulatory scrutiny regarding its own compounded GLP-1 drug offerings. The dismissal of the lawsuit from Eli Lilly against Willow Health greatly alleviated investor concerns about potential legal and litigation risks for Hims, which was the main catalyst for the jump in stock price. The key question now is whether HIMS stock is a good buy following its 42% rally. While the company clearly exhibits strong operational performance and financial soundness -- as discussed in further analysis -- its valuation seems high at current price levels after the considerable surge. That being said, if you are looking for potential gains with less volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark -- a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes -- and has achieved returns of over 91% since its inception. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk in comparison to the benchmark index; less of a roller coaster effect, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, see - How Can RIOT Platforms Value Double? Let's delve into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, for quick background: With $13 Bil in market cap, Hims & Hers Health offers a telehealth platform that connects consumers to licensed professionals, providing non-prescription wellness supplements and medical consultations through direct and wholesale channels.

"Cabinet approves Rs 11,440 cr ""Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses"" from 2025-31","New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved the 'Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses' - a landmark initiative aimed at boosting domestic production and achieving self-sufficiency (Aatmanirbharta) in pulses. The Mission will be implemented over six years, from 2025-26 to 2030-31, with a financial outlay of Rs 11,440 crore, as per a release by the Cabinet on Wednesday. Pulses hold special importance in India's cropping systems and diets. India is the world's largest producer and consumer of pulses. With rising incomes and standard of living, pulse consumption has increased. However, domestic production has not kept pace with demand, leading to a 15-20 per cent increase in pulse imports, The Cabinet release added that to reduce this import dependency, meet rising demand, maximise production, and enhance farmers' income, a 6-year ""Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses"" was announced in the FY 2025-26 Budget. The Mission will adopt a comprehensive strategy covering research, seed systems, area expansion, procurement, and price stability. The emphasis will be placed on developing and disseminating the latest varieties of pulses which are high in productivity, pest-resistant and climate-resilient. Multi-location trials will be carried out in major pulse-growing states to ensure regional suitability. In addition, to ensure the availability of premium-quality seeds, states will prepare five-year rolling seed production plans. ICAR will supervise the breeder seed production. Foundation and certified seed production will be carried out by state and central-level agencies, and closely monitored through the Seed Authentication, Traceability & Holistic Inventory (SATHI) portal. To make improved varieties widely available, 126 lakh quintals of certified seeds will be distributed to pulse-growing farmers, covering 370 lakh hectares by 2030-31. This will be complemented by convergence with the soil health programme, Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation, balanced fertiliser use, plant protection, and extensive demonstrations by ICAR, KVKs, and State Departments to promote best practices. The Mission also seeks to expand the area under pulses by an additional 35 lakh hectares by targeting rice fallow areas and other diversifiable lands, supported by promoting intercropping and crop diversification. For this, 88 lakh seed kits will be distributed free of cost to the farmers. Capacity building of farmers and seed growers will be taken up through structured training programmes to promote sustainable techniques and modern technologies. To strengthen markets and value chains, the Mission will help develop post-harvest infrastructure, including 1000 processing units, thereby reducing crop losses, improving value addition, and increasing farmer incomes. A maximum subsidy of Rs. 25 lakhs will be available for setting up processing and packaging units. The Mission will adopt a cluster-based approach, tailoring interventions to the specific needs of each cluster. This will enable more effective allocation of resources, enhance productivity, and promote geographic diversification of pulse production. A major feature of the Mission will be to ensure maximum procurement of Tur, Urad, and Masoor under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) of PM-AASHA. NAFED and NCCF will undertake 100 per cent procurement in participating states for the next four years from farmers who register with these agencies and enter into agreements. Additionally, to safeguard farmer confidence, the Mission will establish a mechanism for monitoring global pulse prices. By 2030-31, the Mission is expected to expand the area under pulses to 310 lakh hectares, increase production to 350 lakh tonnes, and raise yield to 1130 kg/ha. Alongside productivity gains, the Mission will generate substantial employment opportunities. The mission seeks to achieve the goal of Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in pulses, reduce import dependency and conserve valuable foreign exchange while boosting farmers' incomes, the release added. This mission will also accrue significant environmental benefits in the form of climate resilient practices, and improved soil health and making productive use of crop fallow areas, the release further added.

Tampa's north downtown area poised to become the city's next vibrant neighborhood hub,"TAMPA, Fla. -- Tampa's north downtown area could transform from parking lots to a walkable, bikeable corridor as the city projects over 100,000 new residents by 2050. The north end of downtown Tampa spans 330 acres of opportunity between the city's downtown core and historic Ybor City. According to a study by the Tampa Downtown Partnership, ""the overwhelming opportunity of this area is the vast ownership by the public sector. Including public road networks, the district is 68% publicly owned. This offers a unique opportunity to leverage existing assets and create a cohesive urban environment that serves the community effectively. Read Tampa's city-wide vision here. Jordan Copher is the owner of Late Start, a coffee house and brewery located at 1018 E. Cass Street, one of the first businesses established in the area. ""It seems mostly abandoned -- this whole block is abandoned, and the rest are parking lots,"" Copher said. ""Do you think you are taking a gamble being the first?"" Tampa Bay 28 reporter Michael Paluska asked Copher. ""We don't feel like that. No, I think there's so much promise for development here, at least in Encore. You know, we've got a couple of 20-plus story buildings going up. There are cranes all over the place in the skyline here. So that is the promise,"" Copher said. The numbers support Tampa's population boom. By 2050, the city is projected to gain more than 100,283 new residents. CoworkingCafe ranked Tampa #2 among mid-sized cities in the United States, citing it as one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, with a 71% increase in business applications from 2019 to 2023. This growth trend occurred during the pandemic. Mayor Jane Castor believes the north downtown region will develop rapidly. ""Well, in five years, I think there are a couple of areas within Tampa that are really going to pop and they're going to do it very, very quickly. One of those is the North downtown region. It right now is almost a clear landscape, and there's so much that can be done,"" Castor said. ""There's an incredible amount of opportunity down in the north end of our downtown, and a lot of those buildings are government-owned, either by the state, Hillsborough County, or the city of Tampa. So there's a great deal of opportunity in so many different ways to bring that to life,"" Castor said. City planning expert James Lima spoke about Tampa's growing competitiveness for talent and businesses. ""Tampa is definitely becoming a more competitive place for talent. It's winning on the tech front, on the eastern seaboard, this is a very attractive place for new innovation economy businesses to land,"" Lima said. For Copher, who was born and raised in Tampa with his business partner, the location, situated between downtown and Ybor City, made strategic sense. ""Just the location. It's the corridor between downtown and Ybor,"" Copher said."" My business partner and I were born and raised in Tampa, so this has been very fulfilling for us. All those people are coming out of the shadows of the buildings to come here. So it's been great,"" Copher said. The transformation represents Tampa's broader evolution, as Copher noted the city is ""unrecognizable"" from when he was a child.

"Taliban cuts cellphone, internet services in Afghanistan, say UN sources","In the past, the Taliban have voiced concern about online pornography, and authorities cut fibre-optic links to some provinces in recent weeks, with officials citing morality concerns. ""The cut in access has left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world, and risks inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people,"" the UN said in a statement. Afghanistan is grappling with the aftermath of an earthquake that hit the east of the country, the return of millions of refugees expelled from neighbouring countries, and a drought in the north. An Afghan cell phone services provider, which did not want to be named, said it was working alongside other providers ""to manage this sensitive and complex situation"". ""We are following directives from the authorities and we hope that all telcos in the country will be authorized to recommence services as soon as possible,"" the company said. Internet connectivity in Afghanistan was flatlining around the 1% mark, said NetBlocks, an international internet access monitoring organisation. Connectivity was cut in phases on Monday, with the final stage affecting telephone services, which share infrastructure with the internet, NetBlocks said in an email to Reuters. Private channel Tolo News, which warned viewers of a disruption to its services, said authorities had set a one-week deadline for the shutdown of 3G and 4G internet services for cell phones, leaving only the older 2G standard active. The channel also reported disruption for private banks and the central bank, while Kabul's currency market was working off yesterday's exchange rates. Shabeer, who gave only his first name, said that his job at a private internet service provider had been suspended. ""People today rely on technology, it is the main way to stay connected with the outside world,"" he said. ""No one knows about the condition of their relatives, and even within Afghanistan, we cannot communicate."" Arafat Jamal, country representative for the U.N. refugee agency, told reporters via satellite link from Kabul that it could no longer reach its frontline aid workers, including those helping with the earthquake response. ""It is another crisis on top of the existing crisis. It is utterly unnecessary for this kind of interruption to take place, and the impact is going to be on the lives of Afghan people,"" he said, adding that it was seeking a waiver from the blackout from authorities. Strictures ordered by the Taliban leadership, based in Kandahar, have grown increasingly hardline. This month, authorities stopped women working for the UN from entering its offices. Earlier, women were banned from many lines of employment and girls from attending high school. The Taliban have said they respect women's rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law. Women's rights activist Sanam Kabiri said the Taliban had already closed schools, universities, recreation, and sports facilities for women. ""The Taliban are using every tool at their disposal to suppress the people,"" Kabiri, who is based outside of Afghanistan, told journalists in a video posting. ""What else do these ignorant men of another century want from our oppressed people?"" Women faced with curbs on leaving their homes to work had turned to the internet for an economic lifeline that allowed some to work from home. In recent weeks the Taliban have engaged with U.S. officials, especially regarding American citizens detained in Afghanistan, one of whom they released on Sunday.

"Govt to launch NIELIT Digital University tomorrow, with AI, cybersecurity, data science courses","New Delhi, Oct 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) The new NIELIT Digital University (NDU) platform, set to be launched tomorrow, will offer programmes on artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and data science, the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) said on Wednesday. The NDU platform, part of the National Institute of Electronics & Information Technology (NIELIT), an autonomous scientific society of the MeitY, will be inaugurated by Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister of MeitY, here. The NDU platform is designed to democratise access to high-quality digital education. It will offer industry-focused programmes in niche technologies like AI, cybersecurity, data science, semiconductors, and allied fields, with flexible digital learning modes and virtual labs to equip youth with future-ready skills, the Ministry said. The Union Minister will also virtually inaugurate five new NIELIT Centres at Muzaffarpur (Bihar), Balasore (Odisha), Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh), Daman (Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu), and Lunglei (Mizoram). Over 1,500 participants are likely to participate, including NIELIT students from PAN India, eminent academicians, and technological experts. It will also include dedicated stalls exhibiting NIELIT's strength in the skilling and learning models in the various verticals of electronics and information technology. In addition, there will be an exchange of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with leading industry partners to strengthen industry-academia collaboration. The NIELIT, a pioneer in skill development and digital empowerment, has an extensive presence in the country through 56 centers, over 750 accredited institutes, and 9,000+ facilitation centers, which ""has trained a total of 43,60,759 candidates"" in emerging technologies, as per the government data.

Sundowns ruling: When do commission 'clawbacks' fall under contract and not employment law?,"The case arose after Sundowns sought repayment of roughly R7.9m in commission that had been paid upfront to Mosimane's agent when he signed a four-year employment contract as head coach. Both the agency agreement and Mosimane's employment contract provided that if he left Sundowns early, the commission would be repayable on a pro-rata basis, with Mosimane accepting joint and several liability for repayment. When he departed after four months, Sundowns sued to enforce those provisions and was successful with its claim. In subsequent commentary, the case has been described as a precedent on the enforceability of 'clawback' clauses. A closer reading, however, shows that the dispute was not about clawback in the remuneration-law sense, nor did it arise in the context of an employment relationship. The court enforced a contractual repayment obligation, emphasising that this was not an employment dispute, but a matter determined on ordinary contractual principles. That distinction matters. Because the dispute was not an employment matter, labour legislation - notably the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (LRA) and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, 1997 (BCEA) - was not engaged. In contrast, true malus and clawback provisions operate within employment and remuneration law frameworks, and must accordingly be designed, applied and enforced with these frameworks in mind. Even so, Sundowns offers useful lessons about contractual certainty, bargaining power and public policy limits that can be extrapolated to employment practices and remuneration governance. Precision in terminology is not semantics; it determines which legal framework applies: These constructs are conceptually distinct from malus and clawback as those terms are used in remuneration law and governance. Conflating them risks obscuring the very specific purpose of malus and clawback provisions in managing risk and accountability in the context of executive pay. The King IV Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa, read with the South African Reward Association's Guide to the Application of King IV: Principle 14 (Governance of Remuneration), provides clear definitions and practical guidance for the application of malus and clawback provisions: The application of malus and clawback are both conditional on clearly defined trigger events; for example, financial or accounting misstatements, breaches of law or regulations, misconduct, serious reputational damage, or material failures in risk management. Since malus and clawback operate in an employment context, they engage the labour law framework. Of particular importance is section 34(5) of the BCEA, which prohibits an employer from requiring an employee to repay remuneration except where there has been an overpayment due to an error in calculation. Accordingly: In addition, the exercise of a board or remuneration committee's discretion to apply malus or clawback is subject to the fairness and equity requirements of the LRA. Applied without fair reason or process, such decisions could give rise to unfair labour practice claims in respect of the provision of benefits of employment. Finally, fault and no fault termination provisions - while they can lead to forfeiture of unvested incentive awards - are conceptually distinct from malus. They govern outcomes when employment ends for reasons typically classified as fault based or no fault. In general, misconduct, poor performance or resignation results in forfeiture, whereas death, disability or illness, retrenchments, or retirement at the normal or agreed date typically trigger pro rated vesting on termination. These South African principles align with international law and practice. In the United States, Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act, 1934 requires all issuers listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq to adopt written clawback policies. These must provide for the recovery of incentive-based compensation erroneously awarded in the three years preceding an accounting restatement, and recovery must occur 'reasonably promptly'. In the United Kingdom, the revised Corporate Governance Code 2024 (Code) introduces more robust requirements regarding malus and clawback. Provisions 37 and 38 confirm that boards should exercise discretion to override purely formulaic outcomes, and mandate that directors' contracts, as well as remuneration schemes and policies, must include malus and clawback provisions. These provisions must specify the circumstances in which they may be exercised, the duration of their application, and whether they have been enforced. Companies are required to disclose these details in their remuneration reports, providing a clear justification for the chosen period and the rationale for applying malus or clawback. The Financial Reporting Council's accompanying Guidance on the Code suggests a range of potential trigger events, including erroneous data, misstatements of accounts, misconduct, serious reputational damage, and corporate failure. The international trajectory is clear: malus and clawback provisions are no longer discretionary embellishments but central features of remuneration governance. Although not an employment case, Sundowns remains instructive. The court enforced repayment because the clauses were clear, the parties contracted with eyes open, and the principle of pacta sunt servanda prevailed. Unambiguous drafting was decisive, and freely negotiated contractual obligations between sophisticated parties were upheld, absent manifest unfairness or conflict with constitutional values. Those same themes should inform remuneration governance. Malus and clawback provisions stand or fall on the clarity of their drafting and the robustness of procedures by which boards apply them. The case also underscores the significance of relative bargaining power. Senior executives who negotiate at arm's length will face an uphill battle to re-characterise carefully drafted malus or clawback provisions as unfair or onerous. Two practical consequences follow. Repayment terms of the Sundowns type are purely contractual and, where properly drafted, enforceable as such. They are appropriate for securing the repayment of agent commissions, and they do not engage the BCEA's repayment prohibition or the LRA's unfair labour practice provisions because they are not situated in an employment relationship and do not amount to remuneration. By contrast, where boards adopt malus and clawback provisions in the context of an employment relationship, greater care is essential. They should be framed as remedial tools, tied to objectively defensible trigger events, recorded clearly in remuneration policies, incentive scheme rules, and award letters, and applied through a fair and documented process affording employees an opportunity to respond before any final decision is made. Temporal scope should be consciously selected and justified - the US's 'three-year look-back' and the UK's expectation of disclosure (including the period selected and why) are sensible benchmarks for South African practice, even in the absence of binding local rules. Transparency in the remuneration report - explaining scope, triggers, clawback periods and application - builds shareholder and market trust and reduces the risks of disputes. Finally, tax deserves separate attention. Malus and clawback do not amount to 'restrictions' for purposes of section 8C of the Income Tax Act, 1962 and therefore do not defer vesting. The Sundowns case was not a clawback case in the remuneration sense. It was a contractual repayment dispute outside the realm of employment law. Yet the judgment's deeper message - clarity in drafting, respect for agreements freely made, and principled limits on public policy intervention - bodes well. For South African boards, the central discipline is to separate pure repayment obligations from malus and clawback; recognise that labour law governs the latter; and draft, disclose, and apply these provisions with the precision, fairness and transparency that good corporate governance demands.",Bizcommunity.com,2025-10-01T09:24:00Z,https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/sundowns-ruling-when-do-commission-clawbacks-fall-under-contract-and-not-employment-law-398138a,2025-10-01 18:30:05.644018,0.1843137254901961
"Business News | GST Collections Rise 9.1% to Rs 1.89 Lakh Crore in September, Marking 2nd Consecutive Growth | LatestLY","New Delhi [India], October 1 (ANI): India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections continued their upward trajectory in September 2025, rising by 9.1 per cent to Rs 1,89,017 crore compared to Rs 1,73,240 crore in the same month last year. According to the data released on Wednesday, the figures mark the second consecutive month of robust growth in GST revenues, reflecting sustained economic activity and improved compliance.

Last month the GST collections increased by 6.5 per cent year-on-year to 1.86 lakh crore in August.

The collection data indicates steady growth in GST collections and net revenues for the month, supported by healthy domestic consumption, rising imports, and a significant increase in refunds processed during the month. India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) system has achieved a major milestone in 2024-25, with a record gross collection of Rs 22.08 lakh crore, showing a 9.4 per cent growth over the previous year. Daily-use products, packaged foods, and personal care items have been shifted to the 5 per cent slab from 12 to 18 per cent earlier. Companies are expected to cut prices by 4 to 6 per cent, improving affordability and boosting rural demand. Staples such as paneer, chapati and khakhra have even been moved to the zero-tax bracket, making essentials like these cheaper. Rolled out on September 22, the rationalised GST rates have set the stage for major sectoral transformation by rationalising tax slabs, simplifying compliance, and addressing long-standing issues such as the inverted duty structure. According to the experts, GST 2.0 has ushered in structural relief across critical sectors, the reforms are likely to accelerate growth by supporting consumption, easing compliance, and strengthening MSMEs, even as luxury and sin goods have been placed in the higher 40 per cent bracket to safeguard revenue loss.

Judge Dismisses Tuition Price-Fixing Lawsuit,"A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit accusing the College Board and 40 highly selective private colleges and universities of conspiring in a price-fixing scheme to inflate tuition costs. In a decision released last week, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis determined that the plaintiffs, a Boston University student and an alum of Cornell University, ""have not plausibly alleged that Defendants entered into an agreement"" demonstrating collusion on pricing. The class action lawsuit, filed just shy of a year ago, alleged that the defendants overcharged tuition for students of divorced or separated parents by considering the financial information of the noncustodial parent, as well as the custodial one, in calculating financial aid awards. The plaintiffs claimed that the formula increased their tuition by an average of $6,200. The lawsuit alleged that the price-fixing arrangement among the 40 institutions began in 2006, when the College Board began requiring both parents to submit financial information for its College Scholarship Service profiles, regardless of the student'' custody arrangements. While last week's decision acknowledged the practice inflated tuition prices at the institutions named, Ellis found no evidence that they had conspired. ""Nothing in Plaintiffs' complaint suggests that the University Defendants exchanged their own internal financial aid decisionmaking processes or guidelines or otherwise shared with the other University Defendants the amount of financial aid they planned to offer a particular student,"" she wrote. ""Nor does the complaint allege that the University Defendants all agreed on the same exact formula for calculating financial aid based on the [noncustodial parent's] financial information.""","Inside Higher Ed | Higher Education News, Events and Jobs",2025-10-01T07:00:00Z,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/10/01/judge-dismisses-tuition-price-fixing-lawsuit,2025-10-01 18:30:05.644708,0.05882352941176472

Threat to kill Kilkenny publican - Man  appears in court,"Making threats to kill or cause serious harm has resulted in a suspended prison sentence for a Kilkenny man. The man must also pay a total of €3,000 in compensation to the injured party and charity contributions. Before Kilkenny District Court was James O'Loughlin, Newtown, Castlecomer. He pleaded guilty to two charges at a previous court hearing - making threats to kill or cause serious harm and assault causing harm. The matter was adjourned to a recent court sitting to allow a Probation Report be prepared, to assist the judge in making an informed decision. Charges arose out of events in a Castlecomer pub in March 2024. Assault On March 4, 2024, gardaí received a report of an assault that had taken place just before midnight. A number of customers at The Corner House bar, Barrack Street, Castlecomer, witnessed events and gave statements as part of the investigation. Mr O'Loughlin called in to the pub in an intoxicated and ""highly agitated"" state. He struck the injured party twice. He also made threats which the injured party took very seriously. There were no previous convictions recorded against Mr O'Loughlin. At the time the injured party was leasing the pub from Mr O'Loughlin. It was leased on a rolling basis over a number of years. The lease was being renegotiated at the time of this incident. Solicitor Pat Finucane said some things had occurred, of a business and a personal nature, that lead to relations souring between the two men. FOR MORE CRIME UPDATES AND COURT REPORTS CCTV CCTV recorded the incident with audio and Mr O'Loughlin could be heard saying a number of things relating to the breakdown of the commercial relationship, Mr Finucane told the court. Mr O'Loughlin is 52 years-old and never before came to garda attention, his solicitor said. From 1993 to 2023 his client had lived and worked in the USA, Mr Finucane said. His objective was to one day come back and buy a pub in Castlecomer with his brother. Sadly, Mr O'Loughlin's brother, Frank, was shot and killed in a violent incident in New York in 1998, however he felt strongly that the dream they had should be kept alive. Pub leased In 2020, Mr O'Loughlin bought the pub in Castlecomer. As he was still living in the USA, where he ran his own construction company, in late 2020 the business was leased. This situation continued for a number of years, but, as time went on Mr O'Loughlin became unhappy about the way the pub was being run and ended the lease. Circumstances were not helped by an incident in which Mr O'Loughlin's other brother was barred from the pub, Mr Finucane said. In a commercial sense, Mr O'Loughlin was not happy with the way the pub was being run and took steps 'to remove some people from the premises when he took over the running of the business.

"International Coffee Day 2025: Cappuccino vs Americano vs Latte vs Espresso, Know Your Brew","International Coffee Day is an occasion that is celebrated on October 1 every year. The day to promote and celebrate coffee as a beverage worldwide. Knowing about different types of coffee on this special occasion is important because it allows us to appreciate the beverage's diverse flavours. It provides an opportunity to explore your personal preferences, from flavour profiles to brewing methods and discover new favourites. Espresso Espresso is made by forcing nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a concentrated, syrup-like drink. When compared to regular brewed coffee, espresso is much stronger than other types of coffee drinks. This is usually only a shot of coffee, and not the entire pour. Latte A latte is an espresso with steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam on top. This beverage is prevalent among many people as it contains less foam, which makes it smoother and gentler on the palate. Americano or black coffee The name of Americano or Black coffee came during World War II, when European baristas added water to their espresso drinks for the American soldiers stationed there, thus Americano was born. Its popularity can mainly be attributed to how easy it is to make, which is to simply serve with no add-ins. Mocha Mochas are espresso-based drinks which is made with coffee, chocolate and whipped cream instead of foam. Their ratio depends on what you prefer more, either chocolate or coffee. Cappuccino Cappuccinos are a classic Italian type of coffee drink made of espresso, steamed milk, and thick foam in equal parts. Making cappuccino is relatively easy, can include sugar and can be done at home, too, if you know how to make espresso. Flat white If you're not familiar with flat whites, they're a type of coffee drink that's made with espresso and steamed milk. When the espresso and milk are mixed to make this, they create a delicious combination that's both smooth and creamy. Cafe au lait This coffee beverage is made with dark roast coffee and steamed milk. The milk is generally warmed up and frothed before it is added to the coffee. Macchiato Macchiato espresso is an espresso with a splash of milk. You might have noticed that many coffee shops top off this type of coffee drink with some foamed milk instead of just steamed milk for what's known as a traditional macchiato. : Banana Pakora Recipe: A Crispy and Flavorful Snack Beyond Onion and Potato Fritters Cold Brew Cold brew coffee is created by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cool or room temperature water for an extended period, often 12 hours or more.

Opinion: Eskom's selective war on competition - a wake-up call for the Competition Commission?,"Sign up to receive our newsletters and magazine free - . Chris Yelland, Managing Director at EE Business Intelligence, provides his personal take on the Power Utility's Competition Commission Conundrum. South Africa is at a critical juncture. With the Electricity Regulation Amendment Act (ERAA) now enshrining open access and competition into law, the promise of a reformed, liberalised electricity sector is finally within reach. But Eskom's conduct - and the silence of the Competition Commission - threaten to unravel these reforms before they even begin. For more than a decade, private electricity traders have operated in South Africa with Eskom's acceptance. PowerX, licensed by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) in 2009, and at least four others licensed since 2021, have been contracting with customers in Eskom and municipal supply areas. There were no court reviews, no objections, and it was business as usual. Then, in 2024, there were five new electricity trader licence applications - by Green Electron Market, GreenCo, CBI Electric Apollo, NOA Energy Trading and Discovery Green - and suddenly, Eskom changed tack. It lodged objections against all five trading licence applications during the NERSA hearings. However, in October 2024 and January 2025, NERSA granted the above five applicants trading licences, together with an import/export licence to GreenCo - the first of its kind. Eskom has subsequently filed a High Court review application in efforts to overturn these specific decisions by NERSA. Since then, NERSA has granted four further trading licence applications - to Solis Energy Trading, Investec Bank, SOLA TradeCo and LinkSolar. While initially indicating its intention to oppose at least some of these applications, Eskom ultimately did not object, as evidenced by the cancellation of NERSA hearings after no stakeholders or members of the public registered to make representation to NERSA in respect of these applications. Eskom's inconsistencies are startling and unexplained. If Eskom truly believed traders undermined its tariffs, cross-subsidies or exclusive rights, it would oppose all licences. Instead, it fights some while tolerating others. This is not principle, it is protectionism. It reveals Eskom's legal posture as opportunistic - a strategy seemingly designed to cherry-pick which competitors it fears most. For years Eskom accepted these realities. Now, as liberalisation gathers pace, Eskom objects selectively - revealing its hand through anti-competitive exclusionary conduct - a textbook abuse of dominance. The move has not gone unnoticed at the top. On 11 August 2025, Energy & Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa publicly urged Eskom to drop its legal challenge to NERSA's trading licences. He warned that litigation was undermining the very reforms Parliament had mandated and called on NERSA to expedite the finalisation of trading rules. Business leadership groups - Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) and Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) - echoed his call, urging Eskom to align with national policy. And yet Eskom has not stood down. This highlights a critical gap: if the Minister cannot persuade Eskom to abandon a litigation strategy that clearly contradicts Government's own policy, how can investors trust Government's ability to deliver on the Independent Transmission Project (ITP) programme or the Just Energy Transition (JET) especially as both rely on private sector investment? The credibility of South Africa's reform agenda depends not only on laws passed, but on whether Eskom - the largest state-owned enterprise (SOE) - obeys them. When NERSA invited interested parties to the first stakeholder engagement on 22 August 2025 to begin developing electricity trading rules, the intention was to create a collaborative forum to kickstart the process. But Eskom's opening presentation reads less like a positive contribution and more like a court challenge, turning NERSA's first trading rules workgroup into a virtual courtroom. Slide after slide insisted that NERSA's licensing of traders was unlawful, that contracts between distributors and customers had been ""unilaterally cancelled,"" and that customer choice was not an absolute right. In effect, Eskom used a collaborative regulatory workshop to advance its litigation strategy - before the courts have even had the chance to consider the matter. This is not good good-faith engagement. It is virtual litigation, conducted under the cover of stakeholder consultation. This sits uneasily with the ERAA itself, which enshrines the promotion of competition and customer choice as explicit objectives of the law. Eskom's approach is a throwback to the old monopoly model, directly at odds with the very reforms Parliament has just passed. A similar abuse of process occurred during the final stakeholder consultation workshop on the draft Market Code on 11 September 2025. After failing to participate and engage in the first nine workshops facilitated by the National Energy Crisis Committee (NECOM) and NTCSA in 2024 and 2025, a representative from the Eskom Regulatory team finally pitched up to make input clearly intended to throw a spanner in the works. The credibility gap is glaring. How can Eskom be trusted to help design the rules of a competitive market when it is simultaneously litigating to prevent that market from emerging? If Eskom's behaviour in stakeholder workshops and its court papers isn't enough, its own recently published wheeling policy drives the point home. Instead of aligning with NERSA's Third-Party Wheeling Rules - enacted and promulgated after an exhaustive consultation - Eskom has produced a policy that openly contradicts them. The policy fails to recognise traders as legitimate participants, imposes new administrative charges not approved by NERSA, and seeks to carve out its own balancing and forecasting mechanism which should be the remit of the NERSA rules. In short, Eskom is not implementing the Regulator's rules, it is rewriting them. In doing so, Eskom is once again using its dominance to frustrate the very reforms Parliament and NERSA have put in place to open the market and give customers real choice. While objecting to selective licences through court action and promoting its own legal claims virtually, Eskom is also moving to lock in its most lucrative customers. In August 2025, it began offering 5- to 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) directly to large users of 10 MW and above. The South African Independent Power Producers Association (SAIPPA) immediately raised the alarm. These long-term PPAs risk foreclosing the market before traders and independent power producers (IPPs) can compete. This is classic dominance strategy: object to rivals' licences while simultaneously tying up customers. The effect is to suffocate competition while entrenching Eskom's market share - a slow but steady death spiral where rising tariffs, locked-in customers and shrinking demand feed off each other in a vicious cycle. One of the biggest factors currently slowing and frustrating the introduction of competition and the South African Wholesale Electricity Market (SAWEM), is Eskom Holdings now wanting to hold onto NTCSA assets and lease them to the TSO. This will compromise the independence of NTCSA and its ability to finance grid expansion, and hence will curtail and frustrate the entry of new independent generation, whether renewable energy, battery energy storage (BES), gas-to-power or nuclear. The problem is magnified by Eskom's incomplete unbundling. NTCSA was carved out of Eskom to become a credit worthy, financially self-standing, independent TSO. Its licence conditions demand impartiality and forbid anti-competitive behaviour. Yet one of NTCSA's non-executive directors has publicly echoed Eskom's litigation line in opinion pieces and commentary. Under King IV governance codes, independence of mind and avoidance of conflicts of interest are non-negotiable. NTCSA must not and cannot be seen to take sides in market development and operation disputes. If investors conclude that NTCSA is not independent but simply a branch of Eskom going by another name, confidence will evaporate. The ITP programme requires investment of R350- to R400-billion, some 14,500 km of new lines, and 133,000 MVA of new transformer capacity over the next 10 years. International lenders, development finance institutions (DFIs) and private banks alike will not fund that scale of expansion under a governance cloud. South Africa has the laws. The Competition Act applies equally to state-owned and private companies. Abuse of dominance is prohibited. Telkom was fined for denying rivals access to its network. South African Airways was punished for exclusionary loyalty schemes. Eskom is no different. Yet Eskom - the most dominant SOE of all - has never been the subject of a full market inquiry. Despite blackouts, tariff hikes, significant multi-billion bailouts and persistent anti-competitive conduct, the Competition Commission has stood back. If the Commission cannot enforce competitive neutrality in the electricity sector - the single most important emerging market in South Africa's economy - then what is its purpose? This is the low road for South Africa: a cycle of rising tariffs, declining demand, selective obstruction, stalled investment and eroding trust - where monopoly power grows even as the interests of customers are sidelined. This is a call to action for the Minister of Energy & Electricity, the Minister of Trade, Industry & Competition, the Competition Commission, and policymakers across government. Neutral, independent enforcement of competition law is not optional - it is the foundation of a functioning, bankable electricity market. The Competition Commission should undertake a market enquiry into Eskom's dominant and abusive behaviour to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with NERSA. Rather than entrenching dominance, this is to ensure that trading rules promote entry and enforce governance undertakings from NTCSA, that there is equitable third-party access to public network infrastructure, and that NTCSA's board and management are visibly independent. Eskom must be held to the same standard as Telkom and SAA. NTCSA must become a truly neutral operator. And the Competition Commission should act - decisively and visibly. The alternative is clear: another decade of Eskom's stranglehold, another decade of stagnation, another decade of broken promises. South Africa deserves better. Parliament has legislated it, investors are ready to fund it, and consumers are desperate for it.",EngineerIT,2025-10-01T09:54:00Z,https://www.engineerit.co.za/article/opinion-eskoms-selective-war-on-competition-a-wake-up-call-for-the-competition-commission,2025-10-01 18:30:05.648963,0.1137254901960785
Solana (SOL) Price: Institutional Buyers Step In During Tuesday's Market Dip to $205,"Market sentiment remains bullish despite short-term volatility Solana (SOL) has demonstrated remarkable resilience in recent trading sessions, bouncing back from a sudden flash crash that briefly sent its price plummeting to $205. The temporary downturn occurred on Tuesday amid broader market jitters related to a potential US government shutdown, yet failed to dampen the overall bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. The flash crash primarily impacted retail traders with leveraged positions who had entered at Monday's range high. According to data from Hyblock, these smaller players bore the brunt of the selloff, while institutional-sized investors (in the 1-10 million anchored CVD range) viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. By late Tuesday, SOL had already recovered much of its losses, trading above $209.50 and recapturing its median range from the weekly open. This swift recovery came despite the token still being down 1.38% for the day. The market reaction followed a pattern frequently seen in crypto markets, with digital assets initially following traditional markets downward before quickly rebounding. US stock markets finished Tuesday's session in positive territory after an early selloff, with the Dow Jones even reaching another record high. Bitcoin similarly recovered from an intraday low of $112,656 to reach $114,400, helping to arrest the decline across the broader cryptocurrency market. Data suggests that the negative funding rate resulting from the flash crash created an opportunity that both retail and professional day traders quickly seized. Many opened fresh spot and leveraged long positions, indicating strong confidence in SOL's short-term prospects. The primary catalyst for this optimism appears to be the approaching October 10 deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to render a decision on several spot Solana ETF applications. While recent reports indicate the SEC has asked some asset managers to withdraw their ETF applications for several altcoins including Solana, market experts see this as a potential strategic move rather than a rejection. Eric Balchunas, an ETF expert from Bloomberg, suggested that October could become ""Cointober"" - a month when many pending crypto ETF applications might receive regulatory approval. This perspective has helped maintain bullish sentiment despite the withdrawal requests. From a technical perspective, Solana has formed a pattern similar to what Ethereum displayed before its breakthrough above the $4,000 level. For SOL, the key resistance to watch sits at $270. The token has consistently respected its trendline support in recent sessions, potentially setting the stage for a strong move above this resistance level if positive momentum continues to build. Chart analysis indicates that SOL has already recaptured its median trading range following the flash crash. This quick recovery demonstrates underlying strength and suggests buyers remain eager to accumulate at lower prices. Traders appear to be looking past the immediate volatility and focusing instead on fundamental factors that could drive SOL higher in the coming weeks. The combination of ETF speculation and technical patterns has created a cautiously optimistic outlook despite recent price swings. The situation mirrors what occurred with Ethereum earlier this year, where institutional interest drove significant price appreciation following ETF approvals. Market participants seem to be anticipating a similar outcome for Solana. The current SOL price at $216.82 represents a strong recovery from the flash crash low, reflecting continued market confidence in the asset's prospects heading into October. This price action comes against the backdrop of an overall crypto market that continues to show strength, with Bitcoin maintaining positions above $110,000 despite periodic volatility. The next key date for SOL traders remains October 10, when the SEC's decision on Solana ETFs could potentially trigger the next major price movement for the token.",Blockonomi,2025-10-01T10:15:10Z,https://blockonomi.com/solana-sol-price-institutional-buyers-step-in-during-tuesdays-market-dip-to-205/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.649408,-0.07450980392156858
Serbia's NIS granted US sanctions waiver until October 8,"The US Department of the Treasury has granted a special licence delaying full sanctions on Serbia's Russian-owned oil company NIS and allowing its operations to continue until October 8, NIS said on Wednesday. NIS operates the only oil refinery in the Balkan country. The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control initially placed sanctions on Russia's oil sector on January 10, and gave Gazprom Neft 45 days to exit ownership of NIS. Sanctions had been postponed several times since, but last week the US said sanctions would be launched on October 1. NIS - in which Gazprom Neft owns a 44.9% stake, Gazprom 11.3% and the Serbian government 29.9% - operates Serbia's sole refinery, in the town of Pancevo, just outside Belgrade. The Pancevo facility has an annual capacity of 4.8 million tons and covers most of the Balkan country's needs, and sanctions could jeopardise its supply of crude via Croatia's Janaf. JANAF in a statement on Wednesday said it also has a licence to transport crude oil for NIS until October 8. ""In the coming days, JANAF d.d., through its American lawyer and with the support of the Government of the Republic of Croatia, will apply to OFAC with the aim of obtaining an extension of the aforementioned license,"" it said. ""The possibility of extending the licence after October 8, 2025 will largely depend on further activities undertaken by the company NIS a.d. according to the competent American institutions.""",Cyprus Mail,2025-10-01T10:14:23Z,https://cyprus-mail.com/2025/10/01/serbias-nis-granted-us-sanctions-waiver-until-october-8,2025-10-01 18:30:05.649589,0.05882352941176472

International Coffee Day 2025: Know How To Prepare Iced Spanish Latte,"There's something magical about the way coffee brings people together. From bustling cafés to quiet home kitchens, coffee has always been more than just a beverage; it's a ritual, a comfort, and for many, an essential start to the day. With its endless versatility, coffee adapts beautifully to cultures and preferences across the world, whether it's a strong Italian espresso, a foamy cappuccino, or a slow-brewed filter coffee enjoyed in India. Among these many interpretations, one drink that has been steadily gaining global attention for its indulgent sweetness and smooth flavour is the Iced Spanish Latte. Unlike a traditional iced latte that leans towards the sharper, more robust side, the Spanish version has a rich, dessert-like quality. The secret lies in the addition of condensed milk, which introduces a luscious creaminess and natural sweetness, perfectly balancing the strength of the espresso. The result is a drink that feels luxurious yet refreshing, making it an ideal choice for warm afternoons, casual get-togethers, or even as a midday pick-me-up when you want something more decadent than a standard coffee. What makes the Iced Spanish Latte particularly appealing is its simplicity. With just a few ingredients and minimal preparation, it is easy to replicate a café-style experience at home. You don't need fancy equipment or elaborate steps; just good-quality coffee, milk, and condensed milk. The beauty of this drink lies in how quickly it comes together while offering a layered, flavourful experience. If you're someone who enjoys the perfect balance of strong coffee and sweet creaminess, the Iced Spanish Latte is bound to become a favourite. Here's how you can prepare it at home.",english,2025-10-01T10:17:22Z,https://news.abplive.com/recipes/international-coffee-day-2025-know-how-to-prepare-iced-spanish-latte-1803422,2025-10-01 18:30:05.650874,0.4745098039215687
"Arewa, Oduduwa, Others Back Dangote's Decision","...Urge Attorney General To Order Thorough Probe Of Union's Financial Activities In The Last 10 Years In a show of unprecedented unity across Nigeria's diverse ethnic landscapes, prominent groups from the North, South-West, South-East and South-South have thrown their weight behind the Dangote Refinery's recent decision to lay off over 800 employees amid escalating labour tensions. The groups under the aegis of One Nigeria Movement (ONM) held emergency meetings in Kaduna, Lagos, Enugu and Port Harcourt respectively to accuse the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) and the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) of orchestrating a sinister plot to infiltrate and corrupt the operations of Africa's largest private refinery. The pan-Nigerian solidarity comes as PENGASSAN's nationwide strike, declared on September 28, cripples crude and gas supplies to the facility, threatening fuel scarcity and power outages just as the nation edges toward energy self-sufficiency under President Bola Tinubu's reforms. The crisis, which has gripped the nation's oil and gas sector for weeks, erupted when Dangote Refinery dismissed the workers on September 25, citing ""repeated acts of sabotage"" during an ongoing reorganisation to repair a key gasoline unit shut down in late August. PENGASSAN and NUPENG, which had earlier secured a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on September 9, allowing voluntary unionisation after NUPENG's initial strike threat, claim the layoffs were punitive retaliation for over 90% of staff joining their ranks, allegedly replacing Nigerians with over 2,000 Indian expatriates in violation of labour laws and International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. Dangote Industries, however, insists the affected employees numbered far fewer than reported and were let go to safeguard operational integrity, emphasising that over 3,000 Nigerians remain in its workforce and that union membership is a protected individual right, not a prerequisite for employment. Federal mediation efforts by the Ministry of Labour and Employment stalled on Monday, with talks set to resume today amid fears of broader economic fallout, including halted truck loadings and potential blackouts from thermal plant shutdowns. In Kaduna, the Arewa Youth Forum decried the unions' actions as a ""deliberate assault on Northern economic aspirations."" Led by convener Malam Idris Suleiman, the AYF framed the layoffs as a ""defensive necessity to block infiltrators intent on reviving subsidy-era corruption in a private enterprise."" Suleiman accused PENGASSAN and NUPENG of exploiting the MoU to ""embed racketeers who siphoned billions from public refineries through ghost contracts,"" warning that their strike threatens the refinery's role in stabilising the naira and curbing inflation, now below 20% for the first time in years. ""The Arewa Youth Forum unequivocally supports Dangote Refinery's layoffs to purge saboteurs, safeguarding Northern hopes for economic revival. ""We accuse PENGASSAN and NUPENG of scheming to implant corrupt syndicates into this private enterprise, echoing their subsidy thefts, and urge Attorney General Lateef Fagbemi to launch an EFCC probe into their financial dealings from 2015 to 2025 to expose illicit gains."" In Ibadan, the Oduduwa Peace Advocates (OPA) endorsed Dangote Refinery's sackings as a ""bold stand against labour-induced corruption."" The high-level caucus, attended by over 120 Yoruba leaders, condemned PENGASSAN's strike escalation on Monday, which halted field operations, as an ""attack on Yoruba entrepreneurial spirit."" OPA spokesperson Chief Tunde Afolabi highlighted the refinery's role in strengthening Lagos-Ibadan trade corridors, now at risk from union-driven fuel shortages that could spike transport costs by 30%. OPA traced the dispute to deliberate sabotage linked to the August gasoline unit failure, costing $100 million in repairs, and accused unions of using the MoU to ""plant cronies mirroring NNPCL's $20 billion subsidy heists."" Afolabi praised Bola Tinubu's deregulation, which has attracted $50 billion in upstream investments, and dismissed PENGASSAN's claims of anti-Nigerian layoffs as ""propaganda to mask their greed,"" noting the refinery's 3,000-strong Nigerian workforce. The group urged Yoruba youth to rally behind Dangote, framing it as a symbol of regional innovation. ""These unions, silent during fuel queues that crippled Yoruba traders, now feign advocacy to line their pockets,"" Afolabi declared. Meanwhile, the Igbo Young Professionals Forum (IYPF) assembled in Enugu for a stakeholder summit, endorsing Dangote Refinery's layoffs as a ""preemptive strike against corruption's spread into Nigeria's private sector."" The forum, drawing tech entrepreneurs and youth leaders, slammed PENGASSAN and NUPENG's strike as a ""ploy to sabotage Igbo economic aspirations"" by disrupting fuel supplies vital to Aba's markets. IYPF President Chidi Okonkwo tied the refinery's stability to the potential for 100,000 Eastern jobs, now threatened by union actions risking the Q4 2024 N3.42 trillion trade surplus. IYPF dissected the unions' tactics, linking the sackings to sabotage behind the August unit failure and accusing PENGASSAN and NUPENG of exploiting the MoU to ""embed agents who thrived on subsidy scams."" Okonkwo criticised their opaque finances, including unaccounted dues from IOCs, and connected the crisis to PIA-driven gains like 1.4 billion barrels unlocked via field plans. The group mobilised diaspora networks to pressure global labour bodies, arguing that PENGASSAN's ""prayer vigil"" strikes violate voluntary unionisation laws. ""Igbo ingenuity thrives on fairness; we stand with Dangote to block saboteurs prioritising profit over progress,"" Okonkwo affirmed, urging federal action. On its part, the Niger Delta Peace and Development Assembly (NDPDA) convened a critical town hall in Port Harcourt, voicing robust support for Dangote Refinery's sackings as a ""stand against union sabotage threatening the Niger Delta's economic lifeline."" The gathering, attended by oil community leaders and environmental activists, condemned PENGASSAN and NUPENG's strike as a ""betrayal of the region's resource control struggle,"" risking fuel shortages that could cripple Port Harcourt's industrial zones. NDPDA convener Mrs Ebiere Okorie linked the refinery's stability to equitable wealth distribution under the PIA, vital for fishing and trading communities. NDPDA highlighted how the layoffs countered sabotage linked to the August shutdown, accusing unions of exploiting the MoU to ""embed corrupt agents who profited from subsidy scams."" ""These unions ignored Niger Delta suffering under fuel scarcity while pocketing illicit gains; now they threaten our hope for self-sufficiency,"" Okorie declared. The assembly urged the Niger Delta youth to reject union protests, framing Dangote as a partner in local refining capacity. ""Our region has bled from NNPCL's failures; we won't let PENGASSAN turn Dangote into another looting ground,"" Okorie asserted, calling for a federal injunction to halt the strike's ""economic terrorism"" before mediation resumes.",New Telegraph,2025-10-01T10:12:40Z,https://newtelegraphng.com/arewa-oduduwa-others-back-dangotes-decision/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.651634,-0.3019607843137255
"Bank of Baroda: Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda's view on Policy - APN News","The credit policy has definitely indicated that there is scope for another rate cut going ahead even though it has held the repo rate unchanged and also kept the stance as neutral. Ideally one would expect the stance to change first before there is a rate cut. However, this time the policy has stated that there is scope for supporting the growth process going ahead. The bond market ideally should have been affected positively with yields coming down. It is possible that liquidity infusion measures were expected given the rather tight position presently. Here the MPC believes that the measures already taken through the CRR will address this issue. The higher forecast of growth at 6.8% is a good signal sent as this is also at the higher end of the CEA's forecast of 6.3-6.8%. This coupled with lower inflation of 2.6% does put the fundamentals in a sweet spot. It also looks like that the RBI is waiting for the transmission of the earlier rate cut of 100 bps to be passed on the lending side. We could expect a rate cut provided the data supports it in the course of the year. Given that inflation will be 4.5% in Q1 of next year a repo rate of 5.5% will mean a real rate of just 1%. This will be critical when a call is taken given that the low base effect of inflation this year will tend to prop up inflation in FY27.",APN News,2025-10-01T10:12:35Z,https://www.apnnews.com/bank-of-baroda-madan-sabnavis-chief-economist-bank-of-barodas-view-on-policy/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.651805,0.3098039215686275
"5G, Digital Twin and AI: Inside one of Europe's most innovative intermodal terminals","The East-West Gate (EWG) intermodal terminal's fully integrated digital ecosystem is redefining safety, transparency, and efficiency in logistics. From OCR gates and artificial intelligence to 5G-controlled cranes, every solution is connected through a single platform, giving operators real-time control over the 85-hectare facility. From the day it opened, the EWG terminal has stood out as one of Europe's most forward-thinking logistics hubs. Its operations are built on a seamlessly integrated digital infrastructure that links everything from OCR gates and the site's digital twin to 5G-driven cranes and a central data platform. This enables not only faster and more secure operations, but also an unprecedented level of transparency for customers. At the terminal's entrance, OCR gates instantly record the details of arriving trucks and trains, while AI automatically detects container damage. The system can identify nearly thirty different types of defects, such as punctured sidewalls, greatly supporting staff in inspecting cargo. Full panoramic images are captured for every train and truck, allowing operators to determine whether any damage occurred before or after arrival. Safety is further reinforced by the Milestone camera system, which continuously monitors the terminal. This intelligent solution goes beyond traffic recording: it also enhances workplace safety by automatically flagging if someone is not wearing mandatory protective gear, such as a helmet or high-visibility vest. Taking digitalisation to the next level, a 3D digital twin provides real-time, graphical visualisation of everything happening across the terminal -- day or night, in rain or fog. Beyond visualisation, the system offers powerful analytics: for example, the status of refrigerated containers can be checked instantly, and virtually any operational data can be processed and displayed on demand. EWG's development team is also exploring how artificial intelligence can be applied even more extensively in the future. Plans include AI-based predictive and decision-support solutions to boost logistics efficiency further, optimise resource utilisation, and raise operational reliability to an even higher level. The terminal's 5G-based crane control system is a European first. Thanks to ultra-low-latency connectivity, cranes can be operated remotely with pinpoint precision and safety, paving the way for future full automation. A Kafka-based central data platform ties all these technologies together. Every piece of incoming information is collected in one place, where it can be analysed, replayed, and archived in real time. As a result, just three operators can safely and comprehensively oversee the entire 85-hectare site. Facility management is further strengthened by a SCADA system that centrally monitors the power grid, energy use, and key infrastructure such as wastewater pumps. Looking ahead, EWG is considering the development of a dedicated mobile application to provide drivers with real-time, on-site navigation. The concept envisions a digitally mapped internal road network that would guide trucks precisely to their designated locations while enabling dispatcher-driver communication through the same channel. The goal would be to speed up movements among the 200 parking spaces and introduce additional monitoring capabilities. These forward-looking technology initiatives highlight the direction in which intermodal logistics is evolving: toward a fully digitalised, integrated 5G-based ecosystem designed to deliver efficiency, safety, and transparency for operators and customers alike.",RailFreight.com,2025-10-01T10:14:57Z,https://www.railfreight.com/railfreight/2025/10/01/5g-digital-twin-and-ai-inside-one-of-europes-most-innovative-intermodal-terminals/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.652198,0.2
GeoVax Labs Shares Plunge Following $2.5 Million Capital Raise Announcement,"GeoVax Labs witnessed a severe market selloff, with its stock price collapsing by nearly 25% after the company revealed plans for a $2.5 million capital infusion. The biotechnology firm's shares tumbled to $0.47, signaling a pronounced downward trajectory for the equity. The dramatic decline occurred after GeoVax Labs confirmed a direct capital placement with institutional investors following Tuesday's market close. Such financing arrangements typically result in the dilution of existing shareholders' stakes, which accounts for the intense negative reaction from the investment community. The stock immediately lost substantial value, settling at a closing price of $0.4731.

First Drive: The Citroen e-C5 Aircross is all about comfort and space,"The French firm's largest SUV has just been given a new look and an electric powertrain. Cameron Richards has driven it to tell us more. Midsize electric SUVs are all the rage, with several car manufacturers wanting a slice of this very competitive market. If you take a look at Citroen's offering in this area, the C5 Aircross, over the years, it's become a rather sensible choice among buyers, but it was starting to show its age in certain areas. Citroën has returned to the drawing board to create the second-generation C5 Aircross, and this time, it features an electric offering with the e-C5 Aircross. Is it a case of all show and no go? Or does this new electric model really have substance to be a class leader? We've driven it to find out. The most important thing you need to know is that underneath its skin, the car is completely new. It sits on Stellantis' STLA-M Platform, which is shared with cars such as the Vauxhall Grandland Electric and Peugeot e-3008. There is a choice of two battery packs, and the car receives Citroen's latest design language, with lots of bold lines to make this French offering just a little bit different from the competition. The car is bigger, longer and more practical than the outgoing model and you'll also be able to get a choice of plug-in hybrid and regular hybrid powertrains, if you don't want to go down the electric route. Citroen offers the car with a choice of two battery packs, but we're driving the 'Extended Range' model, which comes fitted with a 97kWh battery and an electric motor to produce a total of 227bhp and 343Nm of torque. Citroen claims that this model can travel up to 422 miles between trips to the plug, which makes it one of the best in the segment for electric driving ranges. Meanwhile, the car is compatible with 160kW DC rapid-charging, meaning a 20 to 80 per cent top-up will take 27 minutes. The 'Standard Range' model comes with a 73kWh battery and an electric motor that develops 207bhp, but produces the same torque as the bigger battery unit, with Citroen claiming this model can travel up to 320 miles on a single charge. The driving experience of this electric model is similar to the plug-in hybrid car in the way that it has a very smooth power delivery, while the 'Advanced Comfort' suspension is supple, composed and - you guessed it - comfortable on longer journeys. The cabin is refined with little intrusion of wind, road and tyre noise and its steering is nicely weighted, just like the combustion-engined car. Also, this electric model comes with the added benefit of regenerative braking, which means you can drive with just the throttle - lift off and the car starts slowing down while feeding energy back into the batteries. The only issue we have with the electric version is weight. It carries a 235kg penalty over standard versions and this makes itself known through the corners. It's got a tendency to lean through the corners and when coupled with a spongy brake pedal, makes the Aircross feel less than dynamic. Citroen's design language always stands out from the crowd and this new SUV is no different. One of the most standout design elements is the rear 'Light Wings' taillights, which protrude around the tailgate, while there are nods to Citroen models of yesteryear with the C-pillar grille design, which harks back to the old BX from the 1980s, and the car's side profile has squared-off wheel arches and hidden window seals for a sleeker design. At the front, the car uses Citroen's three-point light signature and the front grille has been smoothed over to improve aerodynamics and efficiency. The Aircross' cabin is referred to as the 'C-Zen Lounge', with its wraparound design and fabric-textured dashboard that flows into the door card panels. The floating centre console and infotainment system look modern, while there are several storage areas dotted about the place to make it much more family-friendly. There are deep door bins in the front and rear, a cavernous centre armrest storage area and two cupholders with a cut-out behind the floating touchscreen. In the back, things are just as impressive, with further seatback pockets on the front seats with phone holders, as well as plenty of head and legroom for rear-seat occupants. Boot space is one of the best-in-class too, with the e-C5 offering 651 litres or 1,668 litres with the rear seats folded down, which is bigger than what you'd get on a Skoda Enyaq, which offers 585 litres. Citroen offers lots of standard equipment with the e-C5 Aircross, with all cars coming with a vehicle-to-load (V2L) function, which allows electrical appliances such as a coffee machine or microwave to be powered with the car's battery. It could be useful for air pumps when camping, too. You can add an efficiency-boosting heat pump to the entry-level You! and mid-specification Plus trims as a £700 optional extra, but our top-of-the-line Max trim gets this feature as standard. In terms of pricing, the range kicks off at £34,065 with all cars coming with 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and a 13-inch infotainment screen. Prices jump up to £36,705 for the mid-level car and add extras such as an auto dimming rear view mirror, power folding door mirrors and extended interior ambient lighting. The flagship Max trim comes in at £39,345 and boasts aluminium pedals, matrix LED headlights and a heated steering wheel; however, prices for the 'Extended Range' model with the larger battery are yet to be revealed. Citroen has done a good job with the new e-C5 Aircross as it offers a lot of practicality, provides one of the best-in-class electric ranges and represents excellent value for money. It's not the most dynamic car to drive in this segment and some of the interior materials aren't the most plush, but there's no question that the e-C5 Aircross is better than its Stellantis-owned rivals, such as the Peugeot e-3008 and Vauxhall Grandland Electric. If you have a family and need a practical, comfortable and capable electric SUV, then the e-C5 Aircross could be the perfect counterpart.",The Irish News,2025-10-01T10:00:59Z,https://www.irishnews.com/life/first-drive-the-citroen-e-c5-aircross-is-all-about-comfort-and-space-BJI4L6AV6BM2RPFHARWAG62HMU/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.653039,0.05882352941176472
"Repo Rate Pause, Inflation, And More, Highlights From RBI's Fiscal Policy Reveal Today","The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Wednesday, 1 October, kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent with a neutral stance, marking its second consecutive pause after a cumulative 100 basis points cut earlier this year. The announcement was made by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra while unveiling the fourth bi-monthly policy for FY26. The MPC lowered its retail inflation forecast for FY26 to 2.6 per cent, down from the earlier 3.1 per cent estimate. The downward revision reflects the impact of GST rationalisation, easing food inflation, and healthy grain stocks. Quarterly projections now stand at 1.8 per cent each for Q2 and Q3, 4.0 per cent in Q4, and 4.5 per cent in Q1 FY27. Malhotra noted that headline inflation has become more benign, with July 2025 recording its lowest level in eight years. Alongside inflation adjustments, the RBI raised its GDP growth projection to 6.8 per cent for FY26, from the earlier 6.5 per cent forecast. Quarterly growth is now expected at 7.0 per cent in Q2, 6.4 per cent in Q3, and 6.2 per cent in Q4, with Q1 FY27 projected at 6.4 per cent. The Governor attributed this resilience to strong domestic demand, GST reforms, a healthy monsoon, and robust investment activity. However, he cautioned that ongoing global trade frictions and the impact of US tariffs could weigh on exports. The RBI highlighted that the rupee has faced bouts of volatility, with net FDI inflows reaching a 38‑month high in July 2025, while foreign portfolio investors recorded outflows of nearly $3.9 billion so far in FY26. India's forex reserves stand at $700.2 billion, covering more than 11 months of imports. Malhotra said the central bank remains watchful of currency movements and external risks. Banking sector indicators remain strong, with scheduled banks' capital adequacy ratio at 17.5 per cent and GNPA ratio improving to 2.22 per cent as of June 2025. NBFCs also remain well capitalised with a CRAR of 25.7 per cent. Liquidity conditions have been in surplus, averaging Rs 2.1 lakh crore daily since the last policy, with further easing expected in the coming months. The RBI also introduced 22 regulatory measures. Key steps include implementing the Expected Credit Loss framework and Basel III norms from 2027, easing infrastructure financing norms for NBFCs, expanding consumer protection under the Ombudsman scheme, rationalising FEMA and ECB rules, and promoting the internationalisation of the rupee. Malhotra emphasised that despite global uncertainties, India's growth outlook remains positive, supported by structural reforms and moderated inflation.",english,2025-10-01T10:17:22Z,https://news.abplive.com/business/rbi-mpc-october-highlights-repo-rate-pause-inflation-gdp-1803442,2025-10-01 18:30:05.653347,0.1686274509803922

"Share Markets See Dramatic Recovery, RBI's Rate Pause Pushes Sensex Nears 81K","After Governor Sanjay Malhotra revealed that the MPC has decided to maintain status quo on key rates, both the benchmarks recovered and rallied ahead.Source : ABPLIVE AI The domestic benchmark indices turned the tables and rallied ahead after the RBI announced a pause in key rates today morning. The 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 715.69 points to close at 80,983.31, while the broader NSE Nifty50 rallied 225.20 points to settle at 24,836.30. Notably, investors exhibited caution early today as markets awaited the central bank's fiscal policy announcements. However, after Governor Sanjay Malhotra revealed that the MPC has decided to maintain status quo on key rates, both the benchmarks recovered and rallied ahead. This surge was led by buying in bank stocks and marks a recovery for markets after they witnessed eight consecutive sessions of decline. Among the top gainers on the BSE Sensex were Tata Motors, Kotak Bank, Trent, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, TechMahindra, HDFC Bank, Adani Ports, while the top laggards were NTPC, Maruti, Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, and Tata Steel, among others. ""The MPC delivered exactly a dovish pause which the market expected. But despite the policy being in line with market expectations, the market has given a thumbs up to the policy since the central bank delivered some unexpected pro-market initiatives like allowing banks to fund acquisitions...,"" explained V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. The MPC's unanimous decision to maintain the repo rate followed a thorough assessment of India's growth and inflation dynamics. The committee noted that headline inflation has moderated sharply in recent months, supported by a marked decline in food prices and the rationalisation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates. Average headline inflation for FY2025-26 has been revised downward from 3.7 per cent in June and 3.1 per cent in August to 2.6 per cent. Headline inflation for Q4FY26 and Q1FY27 has also been lowered and remains broadly aligned with the RBI's target, despite unfavourable base effects. Core inflation is expected to remain contained throughout the current fiscal year and into the first quarter of 2026-27. The RBI emphasised that India's economy remains resilient, with strong Q1 growth in FY2025-26 supported by robust private consumption and fixed investment. A favourable monsoon and GST rationalisation are expected to continue supporting growth while keeping inflation in check, although trade tariffs may weigh on export performance. The central bank further raised FY26 GDP growth estimates to 6.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent earlier, and also reduced FY26 CPI inflation forecast to 2.6 per cent from 3.1 per cent earlier.",english,2025-10-01T10:17:22Z,https://news.abplive.com/business/stock-market-today-sensex-nifty50-rbi-mpc-repo-rate-pause-neutral-stance-1803424,2025-10-01 18:30:05.654639,0.06666666666666665
Maharashtra primary school bags Community Choice Award in UK,"ZP School Jalindarnagar, a primary school in Taluka Khed, Maharashtra, has been recognised for revolutionising public-school education by providing quality student-led learning with its Subject Friend system, a peer-learning model where students of different ages teach and learn from each other. ZP School Jalindarnagar, a primary school in Taluka Khed, Maharashtra, has been named winner of the 2025 World's Best School Prizes Community Choice Award in London this week. The World's Best School Prizes were founded by UK-headquartered T4 Education in the wake of COVID to give a platform to schools that are changing lives in their classrooms and beyond. ZP School Jalindarnagar has been recognised for revolutionising public-school education by providing quality student-led learning with its Subject Friend system, a peer-learning model where students of different ages teach and learn from each other. Dattatray Ware, a teacher at the school in tribal Maharashtra, said he felt ""deeply honoured"" that the school has been chosen for such a prestigious recognition. ""In 2022, Jalindarnagar School, a remote tribal school, had only three students and was on the verge of closure. In just two years, it has witnessed a remarkable transformation to a world class standard,"" shared Ware. ""The change was not only infrastructural but also pedagogical. This is not the end, but the beginning of a larger change in our education system,"" he said. ZP School Jalindarnagar was selected for the Community Choice Award after winning the most votes of all 50 shortlisted schools across the five World's Best School Prizes categories in a public vote. The award spotlights its significant community impact, with skilled community members and parents volunteering to teach electronics, carpentry, plumbing, languages and science skills. The community has also stepped up as custodians of school infrastructure by volunteering to rebuild and maintain the school and its gardens, transforming the space into one that is rooted in self-ownership and collective pride. ""Our world stands at a crossroads. We need leaders who can rise to the 21st century's greatest challenges, from climate breakdown to the AI revolution, from war to want, from populism to prejudice,"" said Vikas Pota, Founder of T4 Education and the World's Best School Prizes. ""It is in schools like these that leaders worldwide can find the answers they need... their trailblazing work will inspire educators and policymakers across the globe,"" he said.

"Hospitality Staff Turnover Drops By Close To 10% - CLH News: Caterer, Licensee and Hotelier News - News for Pubs, Bars, Hotels and Restaurants","The UK hospitality sector has seen a significant reduction in team turnover over the past year, dropping from 75% to 67%, according to first-of-its-kind insight from hospitality people data specialist, Pineapple, and AI-native workforce management software provider, Sona. The insight, which analyses raw data from more than 35,000 employees across the sector and has been published in a free evidence-based report, reveals a powerful, statistically significant link between promoting managers from within and achieving lower staff churn. The findings suggest a strategic shift for operators grappling with retention challenges. As the wider industry faces a 3% year-on-year increase in labour costs, with these rising to 35% of total sales for businesses across the sector. The bulk of that increase came in the last quarter, as expected, but put a lot of pressure on operators ahead of the busy festive season. The report highlights that investing in internal career pathways is the most effective strategy for building stable, high-performing teams and protecting the bottom line. The report provides a critical, data-backed benchmark for People and Operations leaders to build more resilient workforces. Whilst the results might have reflected general ""gut feel"", this research is significant because it moves beyond anecdotal evidence to offer statistically significant insights that can inform strategy and secure boardroom investment in talent development initiatives. The key findings for hospitality leaders include: Philip Eeles, co-founder of Pineapple and the industry pioneer behind Honest Burgers and Breadstall Pizza, said: ""It's time the conversation on people, performance, and culture within hospitality moved on and replicated other sectors, with a more data-led approach. We are incredibly excited to offer, for the first time, insight on what's really changing in the space, and what things really impact employee engagement and retention. The data tells a clear and compelling story: stability starts at the top. For years, the industry has battled high turnover as an accepted cost of doing business. Our groundbreaking analysis proves a powerful link between nurturing your own talent into management roles and building teams that stay. The message for leaders is that your next great manager is likely already in your building. Investing in their development is not just a 'nice to have', it's a direct route to better retention, reduced costs, and stronger operational performance."" Ben Dixon, CTO and co-founder of Sona, added: ""This partnership between Sona and Pineapple will combine powerful operational data with crucial insights into employee engagement, giving operators a complete view of their workforce. Aggregation of this data will start to build a benchmark for the sector over time, providing operators with actionable insights and real value. ""For a long time, hospitality operators have been managing their most critical asset - their people - by relying on gut-feel, historical averages, and disconnected spreadsheets. This creates a constant, costly battle between controlling labour spend and delivering an outstanding guest experience. In an industry where every percentage point matters, where people are one of your biggest assets, teams need much deeper insight and reliable numbers to avoid overstaffing that eats into profits or, more damagingly, under-staffing that burns out your best employees and disappoints guests."" Vicky Hall, Head of People, Wagamama - one of the report's contributors - also commented: ""Pineapple's ambition has always been spot on - to give people a voice at an executive level, using data and insights to demonstrate the positive impact the people function can have on business performance. But what's different is being able to use industry wide data to show comparisons and trends across a given cohort, using benchmark reporting and industry-level insight on people metrics has helped elevate the conversation. Longer term, we can use this reporting to understand ""what is the right level of turnover?"", ""is there such a thing as too much internal progression?"" - questions that should be asked but until the inception of Pineapple, have been difficult to answer."" The report underscores a pivotal moment for the hospitality industry, presenting a clear, actionable path for brands to gain a competitive edge by focusing on internal progression and leadership stability.","CLH News: Caterer, Licensee and Hotelier News",2025-10-01T10:04:05Z,https://catererlicensee.com/hospitality-staff-turnover-drops-by-close-to-10/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.655467,0.3333333333333333

"Guyanese sentenced, fined in US over role in global HIV test kit theft scheme - INews Guyana","The Department of Justice says a Kenyan national and a Guyanese national have been charged in South Carolina after an investigation into stolen HIV test kits and other health commodities meant for Kenya. US Attorney Bryan Stirling for the District of South Carolina says Eric Mwangi, 40, of Kenya, and his company started systematically stealing HIV test kits from a $650 million USAID-funded program, KEMSA Medical Commodities Program, meant to provide care and treatment in Kenya. Prosecutors say Mwangi started to sell the medical supplies meant for Kenya to Davendra Rampersaud, 42, of Guyana, and his company, Caribbean Medical Supplies, Inc, making $177,000 between 2015 and 2019. Rampersaud obtained a fraudulent ""Letter of Authority"" to operate as an authorized distributor in 2015. Mwangi was arrested in 2021 by Kenyan officials on theft and fraud charges. He faces up to 20 years on various American charges. He is awaiting trial in Kenya. Rampersaud was sentenced in a Charleston federal courtroom and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and stealing or converting health commodities that were paid for by USAID. Judge Richard Gergel sentenced Rampersaud to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay an $84,000 fine.

Market Tremors: Shutdown Sparks Wall Street Worries | Headlines,"U.S. stock futures dipped as investors evaluated the implications of a federal government shutdown, potentially stalling economic data and affecting Fed policy. The market remains anxious due to political deadlock in Washington. Historical shutdown impacts were mixed, with the current environment marked by high valuations and market fragility. On Wednesday, U.S. stock index futures saw a decline as market participants weighed the potential impacts of a federal government shutdown. This shutdown threatens to delay critical economic data and complicates the Federal Reserve's policy-easing agendas. The prevailing mood of risk aversion among investors indicates widespread unease over what experts believe may be a protracted deadlock, caused by severe partisan discord in Washington. Market players hope for a dovish stance from the Fed to keep the equity rally -- responsible for consecutive quarterly gains -- alive. Historical data from Deutsche Bank highlights that the S&P 500 index has often remained resilient during past shutdowns. However, the current situation presents heightened risk due to high stock valuations and uncertain market conditions.

"Swiss glaciers shrank 3% this year, the fourth-biggest retreat on record, experts say","GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's glaciers have faced ""enormous"" melting this year with a 3% drop in total volume -- the fourth-largest annual drop on record -- due to the effects of global warming, top Swiss glaciologists reported on Wednesday. The shrinkage this year means that ice mass in Switzerland -- home to the most glaciers in Europe -- has declined by one-quarter over the last decade, the Swiss glacier monitoring group GLAMOS and the Swiss Academy of Sciences said in their new report. ""Glacial melting in Switzerland was once again enormous in 2025,"" the scientists said. ""A winter with low snow depth combined with heat waves in June and August led to a loss of 3% of the glacier volume."" Switzerland is home to nearly 1,400 glaciers, the most of any country in Europe, and the ice mass and its gradual melting have implications for hydropower, tourism, farming and water resources in many European countries. More than 1,000 small glaciers in Switzerland have already disappeared, the experts said. The teams reported that a winter with little snow was followed by heat waves in June -- the second-warmest June on record -- which left the snow reserves depleted by early July. Ice masses began to melt earlier than ever, they said. ""Glaciers are clearly retreating because of anthropogenic global warming,"" said Matthias Huss, the head of GLAMOS, referring to climate change caused by human activity. ""This is the main cause for the acceleration we are seeing in the last two years,"" added Huss, who is also a glaciologist at Zurich's ETHZ university. The shrinkage is the fourth-largest after those in 2022, 2023 and back in 2003. The retreat and loss of glaciers is also having an impact on Switzerland's landscape, causing mountains to shift and ground to become unstable. Swiss authorities have been on heightened alert for such changes after a huge mass of rock and ice from a glacier thundered down a mountainside that covered nearly all of the southern village of Blatten in May.",Winnipeg Free Press,2025-10-01T10:13:02Z,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/greenpage/2025/10/01/swiss-glaciers-shrank-3-this-year-the-fourth-biggest-retreat-on-record-experts-say,2025-10-01 18:30:05.656760,-0.05882352941176472
Metaplanet becomes 4th-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after $600M buy,"Metaplanet's Bitcoin Yield surged to 309.8% in late 2024, showing its per-share BTC exposure more than tripled before stabilizing at 33% this year. Japanese investment company Metaplanet has acquired an additional 5,268 Bitcoin, worth roughly $600 million at current market prices. Metaplanet announced on Wednesday that its latest purchase has brought its total Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to 30,823 BTC. The move catapulted the Tokyo-listed company to the fourth spot among corporate Bitcoin holders, overtaking the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data. The latest purchase was made at an average price of 17.39 million Japanese yen (about $116,000), with an aggregate total of $600 million. With the latest purchase, its total holdings ballooned to $3.6 billion, acquired at an average price of around $108,000 per coin. BitcoinTreasuries.NET data shows that the company's Bitcoin strategy has already generated an unrealized profit of over 7.5%. Metaplanet started adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet in April 2024 and scaled faster than nearly every other corporate Bitcoin holder. The filing shows that its BTC Yield rose as high as 309.8% in late 2024 before stabilizing to 33% this year. BTC Yield tracks the percentage change in the ratio of total Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted shares. This gives investors a clearer view of how much Bitcoin backs each share. A 309% BTC Yield shows that the speed of Metaplanet's Bitcoin accumulation far outpaced its share dilution. At the time, each share had more than three times the Bitcoin exposure than when it started. Despite the rapid accumulation speed in late 2024, the metric stabilized at 33% in 2025, suggesting that while the company is still acquiring Bitcoin, the growth in per-share exposure has slowed. Investment giant Capital Group's $1B bet on Bitcoin treasuries balloons to $6B BitcoinTreasuries.NET data shows that public companies hold over 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $116 billion. This accounts for about 4.7% of the asset's total supply.

"Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals, research finds","Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Somerset Live,2025-10-01T10:17:01Z,https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-10540582,2025-10-01 18:30:05.657296,-0.1294117647058823

"Nifty tops 24,800, Sensex snaps 8-session losing streak as RBI's measures spur buying interest","Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex ended the session at the day's high on October 1, starting the month on a strong note, after the Reserve Bank of India's latest measures spurred buying interest. At close, the Sensex was up 715.69 points or 0.89 percent at 80,983.31, and the Nifty was up 225.20 points or 0.92 percent at 24,836.30. About 2672 shares advanced, 1284 shares declined, and 132 shares unchanged. In the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today, the RBI decided to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on October 1, second time in a row. The MPC also kept the stance unchanged to 'Neutral'. However, the RBI revised its GDP growth estimate for current fiscal year from 6.5 to 6.8 percent, and revised down its CPI inflation forecast from 3.1 to 2.6 for the current fiscal year. While the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee's decision on the benchmark lending rate was along expected lines, the Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced some key measures that could lend support to the ailing domestic equity markets. Banking and financial stocks stole the show, rallying over one percent each following the RBI's latest measures to spur credit growth. The Nifty Media surged nearly 4 percent, followed by Pharma up 1.3 percent, and gains of over 1 percent in Realty. Auto, IT, FMCG, Metal, Energy, and Infra indices also closed higher, reflecting broad-based buying. On the downside, PSU Banks slipped 0.4 percent, the only sector to end in the red. ""Markets rallied across the board on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of India lifted its FY26 GDP growth forecast to 6.8 percent and trimmed inflation expectations to 2.6 percent, the lower bound of its target range. The upbeat outlook on growth and price stability came as a timely reassurance for investors, who had been jittery over the potential drag from steep US tariff hikes,"" said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money. RBI's commentary helped restore confidence, signaling resilience in India's macro fundamentals despite global headwinds. The easing of nerves was also evident in a nearly 5% drop in India VIX, the fear index, signaling improved risk appetite, he added. ""We are starting the October derivatives series at a record 1,488 crore shares OI, with 58 percent of stocks showing long build-up and short covering, indicating a positive bias despite market corrections. Technical levels indicate support at 24,300-24,500 and resistance at 24,800-25,000,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities noted.

Online vs. Phone: Who Wins in Service Appointments?,"'Hold' not customers' preferred destination of calls to auto service departments.Getty Images It should be easy, not annoying, for a customer to schedule a vehicle service appointment with a dealership. But sometimes it's a hassle, as evidenced by a Pied Piper Management Co. ""mystery shopping"" study. The consultancy measured how effectively dealerships by brand handled service appointment requests, both online and on the telephone. Some dealerships did better than others. The ones with problems risk losing customer confidence and loyalty. ""All a service customer wants, whether online or on the phone, is someone or some technology to interact with them,"" Pied Piper CEO Fran O'Hagan tells WardsAuto. ""They don't want to be put on hold for five minutes."" If they are, they may start to wonder: If scheduling a service appointment becomes an issue, what hassles are ahead in the actual servicing of the vehicle? The most common issues that muck up appointment-making include being placed on hold indefinitely, getting stuck in a phone tree/AI loop and going to voicemail when transferred. Pied Piper submitted 4,887 service requests to dealerships representing major automobile brands. For the survey, dealerships receive service appointment website and telephone scores, each ranging from 0-100, based on their performance in measurements tied to best practices most likely to drive service revenue and customer loyalty. The website and telephone scores were combined into a single service scheduling effectiveness (SSE) score. Industry Voices | Jobs for Auto Techs There for the Taking Mini dealerships scored No.1 in the combined scoring. The brand achieved an overall SSE score of 66, seven points higher than the industry average. Following Mini in overall SSE score were Lexus, BMW, Mazda and Honda. While Mini had the highest overall SSE score in the study, Porsche ranked highest in the website portion and Lexus achieved the highest telephone score. Mini's strength came from balanced performance across both website and telephone service scheduling - placing second in Service Website Effectiveness and third in Service Telephone Effectiveness. By contrast, other brands ranked higher in one channel often performed worse in the others, resulting in lower combined scores, says Cameron O'Hagan, Pied Piper's vice president of metrics and analytics. It's important for a dealership to confirm an appointment, says Fran O'Hagan. ""It was surprising how common it is for dealership software not to do that."" Automated phone and website service systems often fail to send confirmations without anyone at the dealership noticing the misstep, adds Cameron O'Hagan. ""Dealers for many brands are inconsistent in sending (automated) follow-up confirmations for service scheduled online."" Industry Voices | Five Things to Know About the FTC's Safeguards Rule He describes those messages as critical for reassuring customers that their dealership is ready and expecting them. Two-thirds of service customers still rely on the telephone to book appointments, even as online scheduling grows steadily each year. Despite the prominent use of the telephone for making appointments, automakers seem to be more interested in digital appointment-making systems. ""OEMs are very interested in online scheduling,"" says Fran O'Hagan. ""If we talk to them about telephone scheduling, their eyes glaze over. ""But when we talk with the big dealer groups, they're all riveted when the topic is using the phone for appointments. There's no mystery there - more of their service customers are using the phone for appointments."" Artificial intelligence-driven online scheduling is great for easy things, such as oil changes. But online has trouble with complicated situations, says Fran O'Hagan. ""If I have a mysterious clunk coming from my car, I want to talk to somebody about it."" If the automated scheduling system has trouble understanding a caller's concern, the call will go elsewhere. But that can take a while. Dealership Count Holds Steady, But Big Shifts Loom",Ward's Communications Online,2025-10-01T10:15:04Z,https://www.wardsauto.com/dealers/online-vs-phone-who-wins-in-service-appointments-,2025-10-01 18:30:05.658784,0.1294117647058823

Silver47 Completes Successful Red Mountain Drill Program and Intersects Massive Sulfides in Multiple Holes,"The Red Mountain Deposit Remains Open to Expansion in Multiple Directions with Assays Pending Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Silver47 Exploration Corp. (TSXV: AGA) (OTCQB: AAGAF) (""Silver47"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the completion of its summer 2025 drill program at its wholly-owned Red Mountain Project in south-central Alaska. Highlights: Significant Mineralization Intersected: Completed eight holes at Dry Creek and seven holes at West Tundra Flats, intersecting massive, semi-massive, and disseminated sulfides in step-out and infill drilling, with assays pending (see Figure 2-5 of core photos below).Establishing a Strong Alaskan High-Grade Resource Base: The 2025 program targeted untested areas near historical high-grade intercepts to enhance Red Mountain's inferred 168.6 million silver equivalent ounce resource (336 g/t AgEq*) at Dry Creek and West Tundra Flats.Red Mountain Deposit Open to Expansion: Both the Dry Creek and West Tundra Flats zones remain open to expansion in multiple directions and the Company is completing detailed geological modelling to guide vectoring towards additional mineralization in 2026. Multiple Untested Targets: There are at least 35 mineralized prospects across the Red Mountain Project covering a 55 km trend many of which are undrilled or represent preliminary drilled discoveries. High-Value Critical Minerals: An ongoing metallurgical study is evaluating Red Mountain's potentially significant concentrations of antimony and gallium, critical for U.S. defense, where current supply chains are at risk from foreign dominance.Fully Capitalized: The Company is fully funded with approximately $27 million in working capital to deploy towards aggressive growth-oriented drilling on our American silver projects. Galen McNamara, CEO, stated: ""The 2025 Red Mountain drill program has intersected massive sulfides in multiple holes. With assays pending, we now look forward to drilling at Mogollon in Q4 of this year and Hughes in early 2026. Fully funded with $27 million, we're positioned to accelerate resource growth on our silver and critical mineral projects to deliver value from America's next generation of strategic mineral assets.""

Photo is not intended to be representative of broader mineralization. Drill Program The 2025 Red Mountain drill program consisted of fifteen drill holes - eight holes at the Dry Creek target (Figure 1) and seven holes were completed at the West Tundra Flats target (Figure 1). The Dry Creek and West Tundra Flat targets together account for an inferred resource of 15.6 Mt at 336 g/t AgEq* for 168.6 million silver equivalent ounces. Drilling at both targets consisted of a series of infill and step-out holes designed to test areas near historical high-grade drill intercepts and modelled domains where the structural controls on high-grade mineralization were not fully resolved. Multiple holes at each target intersected mineralized zones consisting of variable proportions of massive, semi-massive, and disseminated sulfides (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5). Assays are pending from all holes drilled. Based on observations from drilling together with results from ongoing geological modelling, multiple mineralized lenses and domains at Dry Creek and West Tundra Flats targets remain open along strike and down-dip. The company will integrate all new assay data with the geological modelling to guide vectoring towards additional VMS-related, high-grade mineralization in 2026. Quality Assurance and Quality Control Quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) protocols for drill core sampling at the Red Mountain Project followed industry standard practices. Core samples were typically taken at 1.0 m intervals in mineralized zones, and 3.0 m intervals outside of mineralized zones. Sample lengths were adjusted as necessary so as not to cross lithologic and mineralogic boundaries. QAQC check samples were inserted into the sample stream with one blank, one duplicate (coarse), and one certified reference material (CRM) occurring within every 20 samples. Drill core was cut in half, bagged, sealed and delivered directly to ALS Minerals Fairbanks, Alaska for transport to the ALS Minerals Laboratories labs in North Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS Minerals Laboratories are registered to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 17025 accreditations for laboratory procedures. Core samples were analyzed at ALS Laboratory facilities in North Vancouver using four-acid digestion with an ICP-MS finish. Gold analysis was by fire assay with atomic absorption finish, or gravimetric finish for over-limit samples. Over-limits for silver, zinc, copper, and lead were analyzed using Ore Grade four-acid digestion. The standards, certified reference materials, were acquired from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, British Columbia and selected to represent expected mineralization.

BlockchainFX Presale Nears $9 Million - Can It Reach The Top 10 Crypto Before Hyperliquid and Chainlink? - Crypto Economy,"Crypto investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity, and right now, three names are dominating the conversation: BlockchainFX, Hyperliquid, and Chainlink. With BlockchainFX's presale rapidly approaching the $9 million milestone, the big question is whether this ambitious newcomer has the potential to join the ranks of the top 10 cryptos before established players like Hyperliquid and Chainlink extend their lead. Unlike the familiar narratives around existing tokens, BlockchainFX offers something fresh -- an all-in-one trading super app bridging DeFi and traditional finance. As it edges closer to its soft cap, momentum suggests that BlockchainFX could be the presale every investor wishes they had gotten into early. BlockchainFX has already raised over $8.5 million from more than 11,500 participants, putting it on track to smash through its $9 million soft cap. With a presale price of $0.026 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early adopters are staring at near-instant upside. But what really makes BlockchainFX stand out isn't just the numbers -- it's the platform itself. At its core, BlockchainFX is being touted as the world's first true crypto super app, a game-changer that combines crypto trading with stocks, forex, commodities, and ETFs under one decentralized roof. Instead of juggling multiple exchanges, users can trade everything seamlessly while retaining full control of their assets. This positions BlockchainFX alongside giants like Binance and Coinbase -- but with the advantage of being Web3-native. For investors, this isn't just convenience; it's an ecosystem designed to attract mass adoption, which translates into potential long-term growth for $BFX. Another standout feature is BlockchainFX's passive rewards system, allowing users to earn both BFX and USDT through staking. With daily payouts that can reach up to $25,000 USDT, this feature is not only attracting active traders but also appealing to investors who prefer holding and earning steady returns. In a market that often punishes inactivity, BlockchainFX flips the script by rewarding it. The appeal of this presale isn't just in the features -- it's in the math. At $0.026, a $1,000 investment secures 38,461 BFX tokens. With the OCT35 bonus code, buyers instantly receive 35% more tokens, bringing the total to 51,961. At the confirmed launch price of $0.05, that $1,000 would already be worth $2,598. But the real excitement builds when considering analysts' conservative $1 post-launch prediction. If $BFX hits $1, that same $1,000 investment balloons into $51,961 -- a staggering return. This kind of upside is why BlockchainFX is gaining traction as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. And for those looking for even more incentive, spending over $100 in BFX automatically unlocks eligibility for BlockchainFX's $500,000 Gleam giveaway, with top prizes reaching as high as $250,000 in tokens. Hyperliquid has built its name as a fast-growing decentralized exchange with impressive liquidity, attracting traders looking for speed and security. Its innovative architecture gives it a competitive edge, and it has already carved out a loyal user base. However, while Hyperliquid is performing well, it faces the challenge of differentiating itself in a market that is rapidly evolving. BlockchainFX's broader multi-asset model could present a more compelling case for mass adoption, especially if it secures early entry into the top 10 crypto list. Chainlink has long been considered the backbone of DeFi, providing reliable oracle services that connect real-world data to smart contracts. Its role in the ecosystem is undisputed, and it continues to maintain a significant presence in the top 10 cryptos rankings. Still, Chainlink's narrative today is more about sustaining growth than delivering explosive new opportunities. While it remains a safe bet for long-term stability, it lacks the fresh momentum that presales like BlockchainFX are currently generating. For investors chasing outsized returns, Chainlink's appeal may not match that of BFX. Based on recent presale momentum, expert analysis, and investor sentiment, BlockchainFX is being recognized as one of the top crypto to buy right now. It combines the excitement of an early-stage project with the practicality of a platform designed for real-world adoption. Unlike Hyperliquid, which is competing in a crowded DEX market, or Chainlink, which already holds its place among the top 10 cryptos, BlockchainFX offers something unique -- a presale price point that still allows investors to capture life-changing ROI potential. With projections suggesting $1 post-launch, and bullish whispers of $5 to even $10 in the long term, the upside is undeniable. For those who regret missing early entries into Binance's BNB or Solana, BlockchainFX presents that rare chance to get in at the ground floor of the next big exchange token. Investors have limited time to act. Once the presale hits its $9 million cap and the next stage price increase kicks in, the opportunity narrows. And with the added bonus of 35% more tokens using the OCT35 code, the window for maximum ROI is shrinking fast.

"20 Years after Privatization, Free Expressways Still 90 Years Away","Tokyo, Oct. 1 (Jiji Press)--While Wednesday marked the 20th anniversary of the privatization of four Japanese public expressway corporations, the realization of free expressways in the country is still 90 years away. The privatization was a key policy of then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. In October 2005, the public corporations were reorganized into six private companies and the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, an independent administrative body. The six are East Nippon Expressway Co., Central Nippon Expressway Co., West Nippon Expressway Co., Metropolitan Expressway Co., Hanshin Expressway Co. and Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Expressway Co. At the time, the former public corporations' interest-bearing liabilities totaled 38 trillion yen. These debts were reduced to 30 trillion yen by the end of March 2025. The debt repayments ""have steadily proceeded,"" said a transport ministry official. The repayment scheme requires the successor private companies to pay leasing fees, excluding management costs, to the agency using toll revenues. Given their public nature, expressways will be made free of charge after the debts are fully repaid. This goal was initially set for 2050, but was postponed to 2065 after the 2012 collapse of concrete ceiling slabs in the Sasago Tunnel of the Chuo Expressway shed light on the need to repair aging infrastructure. As more locations requiring repairs have been discovered, a 2023 law revision further pushed back the start of free expressways to 2115 at the latest. While debts incurred for expressway construction are decreasing, the six operators' debts for planned large-scale renewal work have exceeded 7 trillion yen. Despite their cost-cutting efforts, a Metropolitan Expressway official said, ""Soaring material prices and rising labor costs weigh heavily on us."" The total length of Japan's expressways in service stood at 10,328 kilometers as of the end of March 2025, an increase of 1,443 km since the privatization. A ministry official touted the development of the country's expressway network, saying, ""We can see the effects of the expressway network development."" Still, the total length includes 1,850 kilometers of sections that are prone to closing during large-scale disasters. Another challenge faced by Japan's expressway network is the management of the electronic toll collection, or ETC, system. The ETC usage rate has increased from 50 pct at the time of the privatization to 95 pct. The abolition of manned toll lanes is currently underway. Nearly all toll booths in the Metropolitan Expressway network are expected to be ETC-only by spring 2028. However, a massive ETC system failure struck the Central Nippon Expressway network in April. It took some 38 hours to restore the system, and about 960,000 vehicles are estimated to have been affected. Confusion arose when the operator asked drivers to pay uncollected tolls at a later date, as there was no manual for such circumstances. A ministry official said that, while the ETC system is ""very effective in eliminating congestion near toll booths,"" it must be managed securely, including during times of disaster. Expressway operators also need to address the issue of wrong-way drivers on expressways. Although they have focused their efforts on information displays in the past decade, the annual number of wrong-way driving cases has remained at around 200. Considering the growing proportion of elderly drivers, operators are working promptly to introduce new technologies to prevent such cases, such as car navigation systems that alert riders of nearby wrong-way drivers and road-embedded bumps that rise up when vehicles are traveling in the wrong lane.

"Plant-based flavors shift toward science-backed masking, fermentation & sustainable design","Sustainability and partnerships are shaping the next wave, with companies embedding carbon and waste reduction into flavor design. Taste remains the breaking point for plant-based foods. Protein options keep multiplying, but improving taste continues to be a central challenge for the industry. Companies are moving past protein innovation alone and putting taste at the center â"" masking bitterness, recreating creaminess, adding savory depth, and baking sustainability into flavor development. âPoor taste is still the categoryâs biggest hurdle,â says Melanie Luangrath, senior director new business development at dsm-firmenich. âIf plant-based products are not delicious, they wonât make it into the basket twice.â That urgency is driving different solutions. dsm-firmenich is turning to receptor science, Givaudan to sensory mapping, Biospringer to yeast fermentation, and Sensient to a mix of botanical innovation and sustainable design principles. We speak to each of these major players about their latest advances in plant-based food flavors. At dsm-firmenich, one approach has been pairing a rapeseed protein isolate with ModulaSENSE, a masking system designed to hit bitterness, floral notes, and astringency at the receptor level. âModulaSENSE works at the molecular level,â Luangrath explains. âIt targets the receptors that pick up unpleasant notes while preserving the proteinâs natural character. The idea is not to cover over the problem, but to neutralize it at its root.â She says the synergy is intentional. âThe protein delivers nutrition and functionality. ModulaSENSE makes sure those benefits arenât lost to taste issues.â Trials across Europe and North America have shown better consumer scores for recipes combining the two, compared to protein-only bases. Lighter and fruitier profiles â"" normally tricky in high-protein formats â"" are now possible, Luangrath adds. The companyâs developers start with what turns consumers off. âWe identify the drivers of dislike in each matrix,â she says. âOnce those compounds are reduced, you have a cleaner canvas to build on.â Givaudan calls the issue the âsensory gap.â âReplicating the taste and texture of meat and dairy with plant-based ingredients remains one of the biggest challenges,â says Catherine Bayard, global product manager at the companyâs Plant Attitude platform. âPoor taste and texture are among the top reasons consumers stop buying plant-based meat.â She points to research showing that a third of European consumers still resist trying plant-based meat at all. Among those who did, many stopped because of poor flavor, texture, or a sense of over-processing. âMastering the base is essential,â Bayard says. âIf the base is flawed, no amount of top notes will solve the problem.â The company uses its Sense It sensory language to map how proteins taste and feel, and then builds flavor systems from there. For meat alternatives, the focus is juiciness, flavor release, and cooking performance. For dairy, itâs recreating creaminess. âPeople expect a yogurt to be silky, a creamer to be rich, a cheddar to bite,â Bayard says. She notes that consumer testing is constant. âWe run co-creation sessions, preference mapping, and weâre using digital simulations to see how ingredients interact. It shortens the distance between what consumers want and what reaches the market.âFrom masking bitterness to boosting creaminess, food innovators are using receptor science, fermentation, and sensory mapping to close the taste gap in plant-based foods. Biospringer, part of Lesaffre, primarily uses fermentation to develop its flavors. âPlant-based foods face a dual challenge: delivering nutrition and indulgence,â says Sophie Laugier, global digital marketing officer. âProtein sources like soy, pea, or fava often bring bitterness, astringency or âgreenâ notes that turn consumers away. Our yeast-based solutions target those issues head-on.â Springer Mask 102 works on bitter receptors directly, reducing off-flavors in applications from meat substitutes to shakes. âThatâs crucial when protein levels are high,â Laugier says. Maxarome Prime, on the other hand, boosts umami intensity. âIt survives processing and reheating,â she notes. âSoups, sauces, frozen meals â"" they all benefit from a savory backbone that lasts.â For creaminess and fattiness perception, Biospringer points to Springer Cocoon. âItâs about kokumi, the roundness that makes dairy-free products indulgent,â Laugier says. She adds that the companyâs clean-tasting yeast protein gives formulators a way to add nutrition without earthy or beany notes. Sensient Technologies sees broader cultural and social factors pushing flavor demand forward. âHealth is often the first driver, with plant-based products marketed as cleaner and linked to wellness,â says Nandrianina Raboanason, marketing manager at Sensient Flavors & Extracts. âBut there are also dietary restrictions, allergies, veganism, and flexitarianism. And then environmental and ethical concerns â"" plant-based fits better into sustainable and animal-friendly consumption.â Social forces matter too. âSocial media, influencers and documentaries have made plant-based more visible and aspirational,â Raboanason adds. âClean eating, wellness, mindful consumption â"" these frames are shaping what flavors people expect.â She points to adoption in new areas. âVegan is no longer niche. Consumers are choosing plant-based coffees, and snacks are catching up. But plant proteins can have strong tastes, which makes transition difficult. Thatâs where our taste solutions step in.âSustainability meets flavor: companies are weaving carbon reduction, clean-label design, and yeast-based solutions into the next generation of plant-based taste. Sensient says it treats sustainability as a core driver in flavor design. âOur program has five pillars: decarbonization, water stewardship, waste reduction, sustainable supply chain, and sustainable product design,â Raboanason says. The fifth pillar is central to innovation. âEvery new project follows a checklist to cut carbon, reduce water and waste, and use ethically sourced materials. Last year we achieved the goal of applying this checklist to 100% of new developments.â âWe are calculating product carbon footprints, with a target of covering products that represent 30% of revenue by 2028. It strengthens our portfolio and keeps responsibility at the core of what we do.â Partnerships are another shared theme. Givaudan highlights its Protein Hubs and the Cultured Hub with BÃ¼hler and Migros in Switzerland, which supports scale-up for fermented and hybrid proteins. Biospringer points to its role in the Flavor and Texture Consortium. âWeâre helping to identify the origins of off-notes and validating yeast-based ways to reduce them,â says Laugier. And Luangrath emphasizes co-development with customers. âItâs not just about supplying an ingredient,â she says. âItâs about making sure protein, processing and flavor systems all align.â âThe next wave of plant-based products must win in every dimension â"" taste, texture, nutrition, transparency and sustainability,â says Luangrath. Bayard stresses novelty as well as authenticity. âConsumers want variety. Theyâre not only looking for mimicry of meat â"" they want new experiences theyâll remember.â Laugier says fermentation will stay at the heart of Biospringerâs work: âWeâre investing in a steady pipeline to make plant-based foods tastier, healthier, and more sustainable.â Raboanason expects adoption to spread further. âHealth and environmental awareness are no longer niche. Weâre seeing movement in beverages, snacks, and savory categories. The challenge is making the taste good enough that consumers adapt quickly.â Closing the taste gap that keeps plant-based products from mainstream acceptance will continue to rely on these main pathways â"" receptor masking, sensory mapping, yeast fermentation, sustainable design. Innova Market Insights has found that 30% of global consumers cite a lack of taste or flavor as a negative characteristic they associate with plant-based, vegetarian, or vegan foods. But, at the same time, the global market researcher says there is low product launch activity across flavor categories in these markets.",foodingredientsfirst.com,2025-10-01T10:16:29Z,https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/plant-based-flavor-innovation.html,2025-10-01 18:30:05.662464,-0.05098039215686279
Prediction: This AI Stock Could Create $18 Billion in Shareholder Value by 2030,"If management's projections are correct, SoundHound AI will be a big winner over the next five years. Although the AI arms race has been ongoing for several years, there are still plenty of companies that are starting to see increased demand because they're on the application side of AI. One of those is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). SoundHound AI incorporates AI technology with best-in-class audio recognition, creating a product that can be used to automate nearly any human-to-human interaction that isn't done face to face. The market opportunity for SoundHound AI's software is massive, and it's already seeing huge growth. I think SoundHound AI could create $18 billion in shareholder value by 2030, a massive increase from its $7 billion market cap. SoundHound AI saw initial success in two industries: restaurants and automotive (with digital assistants in vehicles). This allowed SoundHound AI to get a solid footing and create a few clients that are unlikely to move away from its software. Outside of those initial sectors, SoundHound AI is also seeing success in the healthcare and financial service industries. SoundHound AI noted in its Q2 results that 7 of the top 10 financial institutions are clients, and four of them either renewed or increased their usage. This is a positive sign for investors, as it shows that a new client base is seeing tremendous value from SoundHound AI's product. As these clients become more comfortable with the performance of SoundHound AI's platform, they will likely expand the areas that are being automated, which can help reduce operating costs. This makes SoundHound AI a platform that could pay for itself over time, and businesses that can provide solutions that pay for themselves have historically been fantastic investments. This could create substantial shareholder value, but just how much can SoundHound AI grow by? During its Q2 conference call, management was asked about how much organic growth investors can expect moving forward. This is a key metric to understand, as SoundHound AI has made several sizable acquisitions over the past few years. Organic growth refers to revenue growth that comes from pre-existing business units. While SoundHound AI's overall growth rate for Q2 was an impressive 217%, that doesn't paint the full picture because some of that growth came from a business that didn't exist last year, so it throws the comparison off. While management didn't give an exact organic growth rate for Q2, they implied that it was at least 50%, and that they expect that 50% or greater organic growth rate to continue for the foreseeable future. That's quite impressive, and if SoundHound AI can deliver on that promise, it will create a ton of shareholder value. Let's say SoundHound AI achieves its full-year revenue guidance of $169 million. If it can grow its revenue at a 50% pace through 2030, that would indicate annual revenue of $1.28 billion. That's a huge increase and points toward nearly a 10x in total revenue. However, not all of that will be converted into an increase in its stock price due to its high valuation. The market is well aware of SoundHound AI's growth potential, and it has given it a premium valuation as a result. SoundHound AI's stock trades for more than 50 times sales, which is a massive premium over the 10 to 20 times sales at which most software companies trade. So, if we factor in SoundHound AI's valuation returning to a more reasonable 20 times sales, that would imply a stock that has a market cap of $25.7 billion. Compared to today's $7.3 billion market cap, that would be an increase of $18.4 billion. That would indicate SoundHound AI's stock more than tripling over the next five years. That sounds like a great investment to me, and places SoundHound AI at the top of my investing list if management's proposal pans out. There's no guarantee that SoundHound AI can deliver that level of growth, so there is some risk with the stock. However, investors can manage this risk by keeping their position sizing relatively small. That way, if it turns out to be a winning investment, investors can reap the gains. But if it goes to $0, it won't affect overall returns much. SoundHound AI is a promising AI investment, and if it pans out like management believes, it could add significant shareholder value.

Taiwan's Booming Tourism Welcomes Travelers with Mandatory Digital Arrival Card. Are You Ready to Complete Yours Before Landing? - Travel And Tour World,"Taiwan had reportedly introduced a major update to its border-entry procedures, requiring nearly all incoming visitors -- whether traveling for leisure or business -- to complete a digital arrivals card prior to entering the country. This regulation, which became effective on 1 October, mandated travelers to submit the Taiwan Arrival Card (TWAC) online within 72 hours before departure. Authorities had designed the system to collect essential visitor information, including passport details, contact information, and flight and accommodation data, with the aim of streamlining airport operations, enhancing public safety, and minimizing immigration delays. It was observed that the system was entirely free of charge, demonstrating Taiwan's commitment to efficient arrivals and improved operational procedures. For those unaware of the requirement or who forgot to complete the form online, officials reportedly allowed TWAC submission upon arrival at Taiwan's airports, where free Wi-Fi and electronic devices were available. The system was also structured to facilitate group travel, enabling one individual to complete the form on behalf of up to 16 travelers, reducing wait times, easing logistics, and minimizing stress. Analysts suggested that this change could reshape global tourism patterns, influence travel planning strategies, and affect the behavior of international visitors across Asia. The TWAC initiative reportedly sought to achieve two primary goals: improving airport efficiency and enhancing visitor safety through accurate, retrievable records. Experts suggested that this model of digital border management could reduce human error, alleviate congestion during peak travel periods, and facilitate smoother immigration operations, ultimately improving the experience for all travelers. Analysts also pointed out that the TWAC could serve as a benchmark for countries aiming to modernize border procedures, particularly as international tourism continued to recover post-pandemic. By embracing technology to simplify arrivals, Taiwan was reportedly positioning itself at the forefront of airport innovation in Asia. Authorities reportedly clarified that travelers who had not submitted the card in advance could still comply using on-site facilities. This flexibility allowed spontaneous travelers, or those unaware of the requirement, to enter Taiwan without penalty. Experts noted that this combination of advance preparation and backup options reduced airport congestion, prevented unnecessary delays, and enhanced operational efficiency. Observers also suggested that the digital-first system could encourage travelers to plan international trips more proactively, cultivating a culture of preparedness and awareness of entry requirements. This approach was expected to serve as a model for global immigration best practices. Streamlined Process Enhances Efficiency and Security Analysts highlighted that digitizing the arrival card offered multiple operational advantages. Immigration staff could focus on processing travelers instead of manually recording details, while airport authorities maintained accurate visitor records. The integration of online submission, on-site completion, and group submission reportedly strengthened both operational efficiency and security, ensuring that collected information was accurate, reliable, and easily accessible. Experts further suggested that the TWAC system could inspire other nations to modernize border procedures, particularly those handling high volumes of international visitors. Observers noted that the initiative underscored the growing role of technology in airport operations, demonstrating the benefits of digital tools for improving traveler safety, optimizing immigration management, and reducing administrative errors. Authorities reportedly indicated that digitalization eased the workload for immigration officers and allowed for better data analytics, enabling the monitoring of travel patterns, identification of bottlenecks, and optimization of operational flow at key airports. By implementing such measures, Taiwan contributed to developing a more efficient, technology-driven travel ecosystem. Group Travel Simplified The digital arrivals card system had reportedly been explicitly designed for group travelers. Families, tour groups, and corporate teams could designate one individual to complete the TWAC for up to 16 travelers, minimizing administrative strain at immigration counters. Experts observed that this reduced waiting times, streamlined travel planning, and eased entry, particularly for visitors attending conferences, tours, or family vacations in Taiwan. Analysts further noted that group submission encouraged better organization among travelers. Simplifying the process for larger parties was expected to reduce congestion at major entry points, facilitating smoother processing and enhancing the arrival experience. Observers suggested that this feature could make Taiwan more appealing to large groups and corporate travel planners due to simplified immigration procedures. On-Site Completion Options Authorities reportedly stressed that travelers who did not complete the TWAC online were not denied entry into Taiwan. Airports in the country provided free Wi-Fi and accessible devices to facilitate on-site completion. This provision reportedly allowed visitors who were unaware of the new requirement, or who had forgotten to submit the form, to comply without incurring fees or penalties. Officials noted that on-site submission options helped maintain a smooth entry process even for last-minute arrivals. Analysts observed that this balance between regulation and practicality encouraged compliance without disrupting the visitor experience, reinforcing Taiwan's reputation as a traveler-friendly country. The system's flexibility reportedly minimized travel disruptions and maintained consistent airport operations, even during peak periods. By combining pre-flight preparation with accessible on-site alternatives, authorities had created a model for adaptable immigration management. Required Traveler Information The TWAC required visitors to provide essential personal and travel information, including: Experts suggested that this structured data collection allowed authorities to improve airport efficiency, maintain public safety, and ensure reliable records for all visitors. Accurate information reportedly enhanced the management of immigration procedures and enabled prompt resolution of any potential issues. Observers indicated that collecting detailed visitor information also supported risk assessment, helping authorities identify unusual travel patterns or potential security concerns while maintaining smooth and secure arrivals for all travelers. Implications for the Travel Industry Analysts highlighted that the mandatory digital arrivals card was expected to have significant consequences for the travel and tourism sector. Airlines reportedly needed to proactively inform passengers about the requirement to prevent last-minute check-in complications. Corporate travel planners and organizers were expected to ensure full compliance with the TWAC, minimizing disruptions to schedules. International visitors unfamiliar with Taiwan's entry procedures were anticipated to adjust itineraries accordingly. By requiring pre-flight submission, airports in Taiwan could reportedly reduce congestion, enhance operational efficiency, and improve the overall traveler experience. Analysts also suggested that embedding the TWAC into airline booking and pre-flight communications would integrate it seamlessly into broader travel planning, enhancing compliance and efficiency. Experts further observed that the initiative could influence global travel behavior, making airlines, planners, and individual travelers increasingly accustomed to digital pre-arrival requirements. It was expected to promote proactive planning and more organized international travel practices. Global Effects on Travelers Observers projected that the TWAC would impact traveler behavior worldwide. Airlines might need to revise boarding and check-in procedures to ensure passengers completed the digital form prior to departure. Group travel organizers could take advantage of the single-submission option, while individual travelers were expected to allocate sufficient time to complete their digital arrival card, reducing last-minute stress and improving preparedness. Analysts suggested that the system could serve as a reference for other countries considering digital entry solutions, promoting organized and technology-driven immigration processes. Travelers familiar with pre-submission requirements in Taiwan might anticipate similar systems elsewhere, influencing expectations regarding airport efficiency, visitor safety, and tourism planning. It was further noted that the adoption of digital entry procedures might encourage countries to modernize border management systems, especially those handling high volumes of international travelers. By demonstrating the advantages of digital-first immigration, Taiwan was reportedly shaping expectations for a more seamless, secure, and organized global travel experience. In summary, Taiwan's implementation of the digital arrivals card represented a major modernization of border-entry procedures. Authorities had combined online submission, on-site completion options, and accommodations for group travel to enhance efficiency, reduce airport congestion, and maintain public safety. Travel analysts reportedly observed that the system would influence how airlines, corporate planners, and individual travelers approached trips to Taiwan, while experts suggested that the initiative could reshape global travel behavior. The TWAC was expected to set a benchmark for countries aiming to modernize immigration procedures while integrating digital solutions into tourism management. Ultimately, the TWAC demonstrated how technological innovation, combined with practical flexibility, could ensure smoother, safer, and more efficient entry for international visitors. The policy supported the broader tourism infrastructure in Taiwan and signaled a move toward technology-driven travel management, potentially inspiring similar systems across the region and beyond.",Travel And Tour World,2025-10-01T10:13:11Z,https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/taiwans-booming-tourism-welcomes-travelers-with-mandatory-digital-arrival-card-are-you-ready-to-complete-yours-before-landing/,2025-10-01 18:30:05.663925,0.2941176470588236

Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the Company shall acquire 100% of the title and interest (the ""Interest"") in and to certain mineral titles, and the rights derived therefrom, covering an aggregate of 3,824.3585 hectares known as the Tatatila Project in Veracruz State, Mexico (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Tatatila Mining Concessions (shaded in blue) The Tatatila concessions surround Mexican Gold's Las Minas Project. Several skarn prospects, including possible extensions of the Las Minas existing resource, have been discovered on the Tatatila Project by Chesapeake. In exchange for the Interest, the Company shall issue Chesapeake an aggregate of 4,451,361 common shares of the Company (the ""Consideration Shares""), each issued at a deemed value of $0.05 for an aggregate deemed value of $222,568. Once issued, the Consideration Shares will represent 14.99% of the total issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. As further consideration for the Interest, the Company shall grant to Chesapeake Mexico a net smelter returns royalty (""Royalty"") in an amount equivalent to 1.5%. The Company shall have a buy-back option on the Royalty that provides Roca Verde with the right to purchase 0.5% of the Royalty from Chesapeake Mexico for US$500,000 during the 10 years following the date of execution of the Assignment Agreement, which would reduce the Royalty to 1%. All Consideration Shares will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable Canadian securities legislation. In addition, the Consideration Shares will be subject to further lock up restrictions (the ""Lock Up"") such that on the one (1) year anniversary of the date of issuance and every six (6) months thereafter, 25% of the Consideration Shares shall be released from the Lock Up such that all Consideration Shares shall be released from Lock Up two and a half (2.5) years from the date of issuance. Completion of the transaction is subject to acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange, as well as customary closing conditions for a transaction of this kind. About Mexican Gold Mining Corp.

"Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals, research finds","Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Plymouth Herald,2025-10-01T10:16:13Z,https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-10540582,2025-10-01 18:30:05.664823,-0.1294117647058823
"Porter introduces new scholarship, awards at Algonquin College","Algonquin College is expanding its aviation partnership with Porter Airlines, including increased support for the Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) program through scholarships and awards. The $25,000 gift will establish the following financial aid initiatives: Combined, these initiatives will support 10 second-year AMT students each year, providing financial assistance, celebrating academic success, and accelerating careers. Program Coordinator, Daniel Maslow said: ""There are currently exceptional opportunities for aircraft maintenance engineers in Canada as the industry grows and there is a need to fill thousands of open positions in the coming years. Our partnership with Porter shows that we understand the urgency of this issue and that we are working together to address the industry's pressing need for skilled talent."" This increase in collaboration is the result of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) Porter and Algonquin College signed in May 2024, when Porter inaugurated its aircraft maintenance base at Ottawa International Airport. Highlighting Ottawa's emergence as a major aviation hub, this agreement recognizes Algonquin College's vital role in supplying employers in the region -- and beyond -- with the skilled workforce they require to thrive. Mark Savenkoff, Algonquin College's Vice President, Advancement and Strategy, pointed out that: ""The MOU signed last year laid a solid foundation for the great work our institutions are doing together."" And he continued: ""Our partnership is great news for our learners. They will be equipped with the skills, knowledge, and unmatched hands-on experience they need to succeed as the next generation of aviation professionals. It's fair to say that this partnership is generating a great deal of excitement in our community."" The partnership between Algonquin College and Porter goes beyond financial aid and involves facilitating practical learning experiences for students. For example, in April 2025, Porter hosted the AMT cohort at its Ottawa aircraft hangar. According to Maslow, this visit was ""a real eye-opener for students. They were inspired to meet some of our graduates now working there. I thought, 'This is so awesome! This is why we do what we do.'"" Lawrence Hughes, Porter's Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer, said: ""Porter's presence in Ottawa has grown substantially in recent years and we expect this momentum to continue. As our operations expand, we remain committed to investing in impactful initiatives that help Algonquin College students launch promising careers in the aviation industry."" Porter is also committed to supporting students who identify as women, newcomers to Canada, single parents, Indigenous, and members of underrepresented communities. Porter launched an initiative that offers airfare vouchers to Indigenous learners from any academic program at Algonquin College who may be experiencing emergencies. Covering the full cost of a round-trip airfare from Ottawa to wherever Porter flies, these vouchers help Indigenous learners stay connected to their families and communities during challenging times. Anita Tenasco, Algonquin College's Director of Indigenous Initiatives, pointed out that there are ""Indigenous students from a variety of backgrounds in our college community, hailing from across Canada -- including remote locations. I am hopeful Porter's new voucher initiative will help alleviate the pressure these students may feel as they do their best to balance schoolwork and family life."" The partnership between Algonquin College and Porter Airlines is expected to continue to grow in coming years. This will raise the profile of the Aircraft Maintenance Technician program and further cement Algonquin College's position as a leader in polytechnic education.",TravelPress,2025-10-01T10:05:21Z,https://www.travelpress.com/porter-introduces-new-scholarship-awards-at-algonquin-college/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.971719,0.4745098039215687
Parliamentary question | Answer for question E-002765/25 | E-002765/2025(ASW) | European Parliament,"The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) needs to adapt to the challenges and opportunities faced by EU agriculture but does not warrant a complete revision. The Commission's proposals under the proposed multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2028-2034[1] aim for an evolution and maintain a robust CAP. Within the proposed structure, the CAP would continue to rely on its comprehensive set of instruments, ensuring that common objectives and basic policy requirements are set at EU level while providing greater flexibility in funding, thus enabling more effective support for beneficiaries. The future long-term EU budget and revenue system will shortly be discussed in the Council. A dedicated budget of at least EUR 293.7 billion is allocated to farmers' income support, providing predictable aid to ensure fair income, supporting environmental sustainability, on-farm investment and interventions in certain sectors, including wine. To address possible market disturbances, additional EUR 6.3 billion is reserved under the Unity Safety Net, doubling the current agricultural reserve. Farmers will also benefit from the European Competitiveness Fund and the Horizon Programme, where around EUR 40 billion will be available, including to foster innovation in health, agriculture, bioeconomy and biotech. An inflation-handling method is introduced at the level of the whole MFF to avoid that unexpected inflationary shocks impact the EU's ability to deliver on its objectives, including support to farmers and rural areas. Outside the CAP, in the context of international cooperation, Team Europe[2] invested around EUR 13.6 billion in 2021-2023 in partner countries to increase food security and the sustainability of local and global food systems.",European Parliament,2025-10-01T09:33:10Z,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-002765-ASW_EN.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.971909,0.411764705882353
Money Talks: ?'I went to New York first class. I spent it with the faith that there'd be more money' - artist Kevin Sharkey on making almost €5m and losing it all,"At the height of the Celtic Tiger, artist Kevin Sharkey was living a champagne lifestyle, having made almost €5 million from selling his art. ""In those years, I stayed in the George V [hotel] in Paris. I went to New York first class. I really had a great time spending that money,"" he tells Katie Byrne on the latest episode of the Money Talks podcast ""I loved it, but I spent it with the faith that there'd be more money. I was never going to sit on a suitcase of money out of fear."" Determined to get bigger and better, the artist invested much of his new-found wealth into his career, opening galleries and promoting his work. But when the 2008 financial crash sent shockwaves through the global economy, his fortunes took a sudden turn for the worse. Less than 10 years later, Sharkey was homeless. ""Once you go broke and homeless, you realise life still goes on,"" he says. ""I went on the dole for a little while and I ate, and my dogs ate and it was okay. I didn't have money to buy Jo Malone candles at that point. I didn't have the luxury of, you know, really good bed linen at that point. ""But the lesson for me was that money is temporary, life is temporary."" After ending up in a homeless hostel, Sharkey says he was more motivated than ever to turn his life around and start painting again. ""What I remember about being in a homeless hostel, was all I was thinking about wasn't, 'how did I end up here?' It was, 'how the f*** do I get out of this place and never come back?'"" The Dublin-based artist is now firmly back in business, with three galleries between Ireland and Portugal and a large client list. But his attitude to money hasn't changed and he says he's still determined to live every day like his last. ""I never bought property. I don't have a pension. I don't have a big nest of savings. I've always just put the money I've made back into my career. And I've done that by painting, by getting better, by opening galleries. They don't always work out. You don't know till you try.""

"Can $10,000 in Dutch Bros Stock Turn Into $50,000 by 2030?","Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) started trading on the public markets about four years ago. And it has certainly been an extremely volatile investment. Shares have surged 62% just in the past 12 months (as of Sept. 29). But they also trade a stomach-churning 39% off their peak from February. The business still catches the attention of growth-oriented investors looking to score huge returns. Can a $10,000 investment in this coffee stock turn into $50,000 by 2030? As an $8.6 billion business that isn't yet a national chain, many investors might not be familiar with Dutch Bros. The company operates in 19 states today, running what are mostly drive-thru-only locations. Growth is the key theme. Dutch Bros is rapidly opening new stores. It plans to have 2,029 locations by 2029, roughly double the current footprint. If executed well, this can lead to greater sales and earnings over time. Dutch Bros is an interesting growth story. However, I don't believe the stock will rise fivefold in five years, turning $10,000 into $50,000. For starters, the nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 145.7 it carries today indicates lofty expectations. What's more, Dutch Bros' ultimate success is far from guaranteed. It probably doesn't have the same durable competitive strengths, namely a strong brand and cost advantages, that industry giant Starbucks possesses. Given the cutthroat nature of the retail and restaurant sectors, this poses a challenge for Dutch Bros to maintain long-term success, although it's not out of the question. Investors can remain bullish on the stock, but they should temper their expectations. A 400% gain by 2030 is not in the cards.

Domestic demand surge powers Morocco's economic expansion,"Morocco's domestic demand accelerated dramatically to 9.2% growth during second quarter 2025 compared to 6.6% in the corresponding 2024 period, contributing 9.9 points to GDP growth versus 7.1 points previously. The High Commission for Planning's national accounts confirm consumption and investment's driving role in the kingdom's economic recovery. Gross investment levels encompassing fixed capital formation, inventory variations, and net valuable object acquisitions recorded spectacular 18.9% growth compared to 14.3% during 2024's corresponding period. Growth contribution increased from 4 points to 5.6 points, illustrating infrastructure project restarts, industrial project resumption, and restored private sector confidence. Public administration final consumption progressed 6.5% following 5.1% growth one year earlier, contributing 1.2 points to growth versus 0.9 points in 2024. This increase reflects continued budgetary dynamics within the 2021-2026 governmental program framework, emphasizing public service strengthening and accelerated social investments. Household final consumption expenditures increased 5.1% compared to 3.3% during second quarter 2024, contributing 3 points to national growth versus 2 points previously. This progression stems from controlled inflation, improved purchasing power, and reduced consumer price tensions, fostering renewed household confidence. Foreign trade maintained negative contributions as goods and services imports surged 15.7% compared to 13.6% in 2024, negatively impacting growth by 7.9 points versus 6.8 points. Exports progressed 8.5% compared to 6.3% one year earlier, contributing positively at 3.6 points versus 2.7 points. Foreign trade generated negative 4.4-point growth contribution, reflecting more dynamic domestic demand than global demand. This generalized domestic demand increase confirms consumption and investment's central role in Morocco's growth model while highlighting import dependence, widening trade deficits and external financing needs.",North Africa Post,2025-10-01T10:15:30Z,https://northafricapost.com/91070-domestic-demand-surge-powers-moroccos-economic-expansion.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.973108,0.419607843137255
Better AI Dividend Stock: Apple vs. Broadcom,"Although Broadcom's yield is larger, Apple's has increased faster relative to its free cash flow growth. If you were trying to find dividend stocks before the year 2000, the largest companies in the U.S. were a great place to look. Stalwarts like General Electric (today called GE Aerospace), Pfizer, Walmart, IBM, and the oil companies that would merge to form ExxonMobil were all among the 10 largest companies by market cap, and all paid dividends. At first glance, neither company's dividend looks particularly impressive. Apple's dividend yield is just 0.4%, and Broadcom's isn't much better, at 0.7%. Are those even worth considering for income investors? The answer is yes, because those yields aren't small due to a lack of dividend increases from management. In fact, both Broadcom and Apple have a recent history of annual dividend hikes. Broadcom has raised its dividend every year since 2016, and Apple has done so since 2012. The reason the companies' yields are currently so small despite these annual increases is actually a good thing for investors. Their share prices have increased much faster than their dividend payouts. Over the last 10 years, Apple's dividend has grown by 100%, while Broadcom's has grown by more than 1,200%! But during that same period, Apple's share price has increased more than 800%, and Broadcom's shares have jumped more than 2,800%, so the dividend yield for each has shrunk. Broadcom has done a better job of increasing its dividend relative to its share price increases, but there's more to consider here. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow, and Apple has a lot more of that than Broadcom. In 2024, Apple generated $108.8 billion in free cash flow, compared to just $19.4 billion for Broadcom. Meanwhile Broadcom paid a total of $9.8 billion in dividend payments, compared to $15.2 billion for Apple. One way to look at this is that Broadcom is much more generous with its dividend payments, and in fact, Broadcom's dividend increase of 1,240% over the last 10 years is roughly comparable to the trailing 12-month (TTM) increase in its net income (1,250%) and its free cash flow (1,350%) during that time. That still leaves Broadcom with plenty of leftover cash after its dividends are paid. Although Apple spends a smaller percentage of its free cash flow on dividend payouts, it has actually increased its dividend much faster than its free cash flow. On a TTM basis, Apple's free cash flow has only increased by 37.8% over the last 10 years, and its net income has only gone up by 86%, but its dividend has increased by 100%. So, it may spend a much smaller percentage of its free cash flow on shareholder dividends than Broadcom, but it has raised its dividend at a faster rate relative to its free cash flow. While both companies' dividend yields are comparatively small, they've both shown a commitment to annual dividend increases, and both have plenty of room to increase their dividends further without overly taxing their free cash flow. Because both dividends look well funded and likely to continue growing, dividend investors will likely want to pick Broadcom for its (currently) higher yield. That said, income investors are unlikely to go wrong with either of these massive artificial intelligence (AI) heavyweights.

"UK house price growth outpaces forecasts as North surges, London lags","UK housing prices rose faster than expected in September, with northern regions driving gains, while the South and capital remain sluggish. UK house prices climbed faster than forecast in September, underscoring the market's resilience but also stoking fresh worries about affordability, widening regional divides and raising questions over how long first-time buyers can keep up with prices. ""The message is clear: this is a market that refuses to stand still. While growth may not be headline-grabbing, it is sustainable, it is reliable, and it is happening in spite of seasonal distractions, interest rate speculation and political noise,"" said Marc von Grundherr, director of Benham and Reeves. The Nationwide UK Housing Index showed a 0.5% monthly rise in September, more than double economists' forecasts. Annual growth edged up to 2.2%, supported by low unemployment and expectations of interest rate cuts, factors that raise demand for housing. ""London, of course, remains the outlier and growth has been slower across the capital. However, even the most modest gains equate to thousands of pounds in real terms given the capital's higher values,"" von Grundherr continued. Nationwide puts London's annual growth at 0.6% for the third quarter of 2025. This indicates that demand in the housing market is holding up, with more buyers willing or able to enter despite affordability pressures. Sellers also appear more confident in asking for higher prices, suggesting the market has regained momentum after a softer summer. ""Progress during the traditionally quieter summer months has been steady and, with the added stability of another base rate hold, the outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive, despite some uncertainty surrounding the upcoming budget,"" explained Guy Gittins, CEO of Foxtons. The latest Nationwide Index shows sharp contrasts and an uneven increase in prices between different regions of the UK. While the national picture suggests modest growth, most of the momentum seems to be concentrated outside the traditionally priciest areas. Northern Ireland remains the clear outlier, recording a 9.6% annual increase in the three months to September -- far above the national average. Northern England also outperformed, with growth of 3.4% year-on-year, and the North region in particular climbing by 5.1%. The North includes areas like Tyneside, Teesside, and Cumbria. Wales posted a 3% annual rise, while Scotland saw a 2.9% gain, slightly slower than in the previous quarter. By contrast, southern England is lagging, with growth of just 0.7% over the year. Within that, the Outer South East posted the weakest result at 0.3%, and London barely moved, highlighting the persistent affordability pressures and tighter buyer sentiment in the capital. The data indicates that regions with lower starting or opening prices and stronger general affordability are driving the national market higher, while wealthier southern areas are cooling or not keeping up with the pace. Nationwide noted that mortgage approvals, at roughly 65,000 a month, are back to pre-pandemic norms despite higher interest rates, suggesting that activity has stabilised even if regional disparities remain. By property type, semi-detached homes saw the strongest gains, up 3.4% year-on-year, followed by detached at 2.5%. Prices for terraced houses grew by 2.4% while flats recorded a small decline of 0.3%, continuing a longer-term trend of underperformance.",Euronews English,2025-10-01T10:13:22Z,http://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/01/uk-house-price-growth-outpaces-forecasts-as-north-surges-london-lags,2025-10-01 18:30:07.973825,0.1529411764705881

Capitan Silver Identifies New High-Priority Targets at Cruz De Plata and Provides Property Update,"Newly Consolidated Land Package Transforms High-Grade Silver Trend into Regional-Scale Mineral System Highlights: Mineralized system at the Cruz de Plata (""CDP"") project is significantly larger than previously outlined.Cumulative silver-mineralized vein structures have grown to more than 20km from 7km (previously announced on May 24, 2023). These structures have been identified from surface sampling and mapping on the newly consolidated land package. A large granodiorite intrusion identified to the north of the main Jésus María trend is a key feature for locating mineralization at Cruz de Plata, with the main silver trend now found to wrap around the intrusion on its western and northern contact within the folded sedimentary package. All known lithologies at the CDP project contain precious and base metal mineralization.Six (6) new priority targets identified and being advanced to the drill-ready stage.Property-wide geophysical survey commissioned and should be completed by Q1 2026.Assays pending for 38 reverse-circulation (""RC"") drill holes with additional holes being drilled every week.Fully Funded Phase 1 Drill Program expanded by 50% to 15,000m. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Capitan Silver Corp. (TSXV: CAPT) (""Capitan"" or ""the Company"") is pleased to provide an update for its Cruz de Plata silver-gold project, located in Durango, Mexico. The Company reported today that a surface exploration campaign on the newly acquired 2,171-hectare strategic land package (See Company press release dated August 22, 2025) has identified several new high-priority targets and high-grade mineral showings that include significant extensions to known mineral structures, which the Company is now advancing to the drill-ready stage. These discoveries are significant as they validate management's thesis that the hydrothermal system at Cruz de Plata is much larger than what was previously known, with the mineral footprint and structures now shown to extend several kilometres to the north of the current limits of the 2025 drill program. A key takeaway is that mineralization is observed to be hosted within all known geological units identified at Cruz de Plata, further increasing the potential for new targets, and increasing the potential of the property. Alberto Orozco, CEO of Capitan Silver, commented: ""The continued growth and evolution of Cruz de Plata has been tremendously exciting for the Company. What began as a handful of isolated silver targets has expanded into a much larger mineralized system. The new detailed geological map and surface sampling highlights how robust the Cruz de Plata system can be, while immediately giving us multiple new targets to aggressively move to a drill-ready stage. We would also like to announce that we are upsizing our Phase One Drill Program by 50%, for a total of 15,000 metres, which is fully funded. Mr. Orozco continued, ""the airborne geophysical survey that the Company has commissioned, will be the first property-wide initiative for target generation and expansion by covering the entire project area with new and detailed geophysical data."" Property Consolidation Summary The Company's original (2020) property package contained two isolated high-grade silver vein targets, Jésus María and San Rafael, as well as the disseminated gold target (Capitan Hill) to the south of the Jésus María showings. In 2022, Capitan completed its first property acquisition at Cruz de Plata, growing the property by 261.42 hectares and connecting the Jésus María and San Rafael targets, which formed the Jésus María silver trend (See Company press release dated December 6, 2022). On August 22, 2025, the Company announced the acquisition of a key property covering a total surface of 2,171.4 hectares, completing the consolidation of the Cruz de Plata property package (See Figure 1). Prior to the latest acquisition, the Company conducted a detailed mapping and surface sampling program that, together with the newly acquired data from the previous operator, has formed the basis of a new understanding of the controls of the mineral system and the discovery of multiple new targets. Figure 1 below shows the starting and current land position for the Cruz de Plata project. Figure 1: Capitan Silver's original land position in 2020 for the Cruz de Plata silver-gold project is shown in green with the strategic acquisitions in 2022 and 2025 shown in pink and blue respectively. Cruz de Plata - Geological Thesis Through detailed mapping and sampling, the Capitan exploration team has recognized a spatial correlation between the 3.7km Jesús María silver trend along the southern periphery of an east-northeast trending-elongated granodiorite intrusive body and a similar environment to its north. Exploration crews systematically followed this contact with further mapping and sampling to evaluate the possibility of the silver mineralization continuing along the entire contact of the granodiorite intrusive and the sediments. Results of this survey, which also included compilation data from previous operators, validated this hypothesis (See Figure 2). Figure 2: Simplified geological map and mineral system model, including new identified targets. 1. Jesús María silver trend (Containing the Jésus María , Santa Teresa and San Rafael veins), 2. Gully Fault zone, 3. Jésus María East trend, 4. San Rafael West, 5. Jésus María Northwest, 6. Casco Norte, 7. La Providencia, 8. Jésus María silver trend north, 9. La Purísima, 10. Capitan Hill gold deposit, 11. El Tubo Hill gold target. The current geological thesis suggests that the genesis of the hydrothermal mineralization at Cruz de Plata occurs somewhere below the granodiorite, with the documented radial fractures in the intrusive unit being the main conduit transporting the mineralization across the property. As the mineralized fluids reach the sediment rock package, they form the silver vein trend in a combination of replacement zones and hydrothermal breccias. As mineralized fluids continue to flow further away from the source along these radial fractures and cross the boundary of the Tertiary volcanic unit, this is where the Company believes the gold mineralization is deposited (in the cooler temperature part of the mineralized system - Capitan Hill). This potentially explains the relationship of the Gully Fault (believed to be one of several key radial fractures) to both the Jésus María silver vein trend and the Capitan Hill gold deposit. Recent Surface Exploration and New Discoveries Capitan's exploration team conducted a reconnaissance-scale surface evaluation of the newly acquired land package consisting of mapping, surface trenching and soil sampling, with the objective of identifying new targets. Early field work provided further evidence of structural and lithological controls for silver and gold mineralization; mainly the silver system emplacing around and proximal to the contact with an intrusive granodiorite body (Figure 2). In addition to identifying high-grade silver mineralization around the granodiorite intrusive, the Company has identified the potential for the silver zone to grow via radial structures cross-cutting the granodiorite intrusion. Strong silver and gold grades have been returned from prospecting and are described below. Additionally, the Company has defined the lithological contact between the folded sedimentary package and the overlying, younger volcanic rock package across the easternmost portion of the property package. This environment is prospective for additional disseminated gold mineralization, similar to what is found at Capitan Hill. Prior to the commencement of the surface program, Capitan commissioned a new high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (""DTM"") and satellite image from Pacific Geomatics of Vancouver, BC to help field crews identify old historic workings and areas of potential outcrop. This provided field crews with a more efficient method of evaluating the property and led to a reduction in the time spent seeking these new targets. This program, still in its early stages, has resulted in the discovery of at least six (6) new mineral showings, including significant extensions to known mineralized structures across the newly acquired land package, which are described below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Detailed view of new project concept with sampling highlights. Description of Targets Casco Norte (High-grade Gold and Silver) - NEW Casco Norte is located in the central portion of the newly consolidated property package (See Figures 2 & 3) and consists of a series of workings and pits that trend roughly west-northwest, and has been traced along strike for 150m. Mineralization consists of sheared and brecciated, strongly silicified granitic to granodioritic intrusive that is at least 3-4m in width. A series of grab and chip samples were taken across the old workings, which returned moderate to high-grade Au values, ranging from trace to the best value returning 4,291.2 g/t AgEq (See Table 1). Despite the low topographic relief of the area, overburden depth is surprisingly thin, which will allow for further surface exploration work, including mechanical trenching. Follow-up work will begin on this target in the next several weeks. Jésus María Northwest - NEW Jésus María Northwest is located along the north contact of the sediment-granitic intrusive boundary, approximately 400-500m northwest of the western most drillholes of the main Jésus María silver zone. The showing consists of an old mine working in an area of low topographic relief, with little outcrop, that trends roughly north-northwest. Capitan geologists were able to enter the old workings and obtain a sample for analysis and have confirmed that mineralization closely resembles the main Jésus María zone. This discovery is significant as it extends the Jésus María zone approximately 800m to the west and north, suggesting it wraps around the main granodioritic intrusive body. Sampling from the main showing returned significant values ranging from trace to high-grade values with the best value returning 2,268.1 g/t AgEq (See Table 1). Follow-up work will continue in this area and will include soil geochemistry, possible mechanical trenching, and geophysics. Jésus María East - NEW The extension of the Jésus María silver trend to the east hosts the historic San Rafael mine and has seen small amounts of drilling by Capitan in 2022. Capitan geologists have traced similar style mineralization onto the newly consolidated land package, adding approximately 1.2km of strike to this zone. A series of grab and chip samples have been taken along this zone, with analysis returning values ranging from trace to high-grade mineralization with the best value returning 1,337.5 g/t AgEq. Additional surface work in this area will include mapping and mechanical trenching to upgrade this target to the drill-ready stage. San Rafael West - NEW The San Rafael West zone is the northernmost of the veins and structures that are part of the east-west trending Jésus María silver trend. This zone is located just to the north and west of the El Casco Property boundary, approximately 500m to the north of the Jésus María showings (See Figures 2 & 3). High-grade silver mineralization has been traced over a strike length of approximately 150m with grab and chip samples ranging from trace to high-grade with the best value of 1,379.1 g/t AgEq being returned (See Table 1). Mineralization is hosted in hornfelsed sediments, very proximal to the sedimentary granite intrusive boundary. This target remains open along strike to the east-and west. La Providencia La Providencia consists of a series of pits and shallow workings that trend northwest and can be traced along strike for approximately 400m. Mineralization is hosted in sheared and brecciated granodioritic intrusive and dips steeply to the southwest. Capitan geologists have taken a series of chip and grab samples within the workings and along the surface expression of the veins at higher elevations. The best values returned include 381.6 g/t AgEq. Additional surface work, including mechanical trenching, will be conducted at this target to upgrade it to drill-ready stage. La Purisima - NEW The La Purisima showing is located within the northeastern portion of the Capitan claim group, approximately 4.5km northeast of the main Jésus María trend (See Figures 2 & 3). This portion of the mining claim group was - until recently - quite isolated, with little incentive to explore further due to the very small size of the surrounding mining claim (approximately 200m north-south in dimension). The recent property consolidation has changed these circumstances significantly with the infilling of the property to the south. As a result, field crews were sent to evaluate this area further. La Purisima occurs at the northern contact between the granodioritic intrusive and limestone sediments, with mineralization resembling more of a skarn-like appearance, from the limited exposure observed at this time. The showing consists of a series of old pits and shafts that occur in an area of very low topographic relief, over a strike length of approximately 50m. Grab and chip samples from this area returned polymetallic Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn, with values ranging from trace to 241.6 g/t AgEq. Follow-up work will continue, in this area with additional prospecting, and possible mechanical trenching. Jésus María North - NEW This target consists of east-northeast and northwest striking structures that have been mapped and sampled in the sedimentary unit, along the north contact of the intrusive. Outcrop in this area is minimal, so future exploration targeting will rely on expanding the soil geochemistry program and airborne geophysics. El Tubo Hill Gold The El Tubo Hill contains a very similar stratigraphy to the Capitan Hill oxide gold deposit where Tertiary volcanics rest unconformably over the deformed sedimentary unit. At Capitan Hill, the contact between the two units is marked by the Capitan vein, with mineralization then expanding from that point both underneath into the sediments and above towards the volcanics, forming a large volume of gold mineralization. At El Tubo, low-grade gold mineralization has been identified in outcrop, along the contact between the two units. Additionally, soil geochemical sampling returned anomalous values over a strike length of approximately 500m. Expanded 2025 Drilling Program The Company is pleased to report that it will be upsizing its 2025 Phase One Drilling Program from 10,000m to 15,000m. Capitan has completed just over 8,000m of drilling to date, with assays pending for 38 drill holes. With new drill holes being delivered to the lab weekly, the Company will continue to update the market as assay results are received. Airborne Geophysical Program Capitan is pleased to report that it has engaged the services of Expert Geophysics Services of Newmarket, Ontario, to complete a property-wide 385 line-km regional airborne magnetic and magneto-telluric survey. The results generated from this survey will include magnetic maps and their various derivatives, as well as apparent conductivity and resistivity maps that can be used to help identify new alteration zones, geological features and lithologies, and extensions of existing zones (including fault structures), up to depths of 1km.

Indonesian rescue workers 'racing against time' in search for dozens in rubble of collapsed school,"SIDOARJO, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian rescue workers were racing against the clock on Wednesday in the search for survivors from a school collapse in the province of East Java, with at least 91 students still unaccounted for, along with three confirmed dead and about 100 injured. The Islamic boarding school, which authorities said was undergoing an unauthorized expansion to add two new stories, collapsed during afternoon prayers on Monday, sending slabs of concrete and other heavy debris crashing onto the students below. Most rescues typically happen within 24 hours after such a disaster, with chances of survival decreasing each day after that, and more than 300 workers continued to work desperately at the scene to try and reach those who have been detected to be still alive and trapped below. ""We hope that we can complete this operation soon,"" Mohammad Syafii, head of Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters. ""We are currently racing against time because it is possible that we can still save lives of those we have detected within the golden hours,"" he said at the news conference. Of the approximately 100 injured, 26 are still hospitalized and many are said to have suffered head injuries and broken bones, authorities said. Syafii's agency said at least six children are alive under the rubble, but the search has been complicated with the slabs of concrete and other parts of the building remaining unstable. Heavy equipment is available but is not currently being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. Rescuers in hardhats crawled through tight passages made of concrete blocks, steel bars and rubble, collapsed in the debris, chipping away at it with hammers and hand-held power tools to try and reach those still underneath. Oxygen, water and food has been sent through narrow gaps to those still trapped under the debris to keep them alive. Search teams have also used detectors and thermal drones to detect potential survivors who could be rescued. The structure fell on top of hundreds of people at about 2:30 p.m. on Monday in a prayer hall at the century-old al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo, on the eastern side of Indonesia's Java island. The students were mostly boys in grades seven to 12, between ages 12 and 18. Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. The prayer hall was two stories high but two more were being added without a permit, according to authorities. Police said the old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process. Authorities initially had said only 38 people were missing but revised that upward to 91 late Tuesday after consulting attendance lists and talking with families. ""In the early stages there will inevitably be some confusion about the data,"" said Suharyanto, the head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, who only goes by one name as is common in Indonesia. Tarigan reported from Jakarta, Indonesia. Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta contributed to this report.

Animoca Brands and AlphaTON Capital Forge Strategic Investment in GAMEE,"Animoca Brands, a prominent name in the Web3 space, and AlphaTON Capital Corp., a Nasdaq-listed digital asset treasury company, have entered into a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) for equity and token investments. This agreement includes AlphaTON's potential acquisition of a controlling interest in GAMEE, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, according to Animoca Brands. GAMEE, a Web3 gaming company with over 119 million registered users, is notably active within the Telegram ecosystem, boasting 61 million users. This acquisition aligns with AlphaTON's strategy to bolster gaming offerings on Telegram, a platform with over a billion monthly active users. The LOI stipulates that AlphaTON Capital aims to acquire a 51% equity stake in GAMEE, alongside 51% of the GAMEE (GMEE) and Watcoin (WAT) tokens held by GAMEE. Additionally, AlphaTON plans to invest up to $3 million in GMEE tokens and $1 million in WAT tokens in the open market. This move marks a significant step in promoting digital property rights and expanding Web3 access through the Telegram platform. Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, emphasized the potential of this acquisition to position GAMEE as the first Nasdaq-listed Web3 gaming company, showcasing the integration of digital asset companies into profitable operations. Brittany Kaiser, CEO of AlphaTON Capital, highlighted the strategic acquisition's potential to leverage GAMEE's extensive user base to facilitate the adoption of decentralized technologies like TON. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the finalization of definitive agreements. If successful, this partnership could represent a transformative moment for both companies in the rapidly evolving Web3 and digital asset landscape. AlphaTON Capital, under the leadership of Brittany Kaiser and Enzo Villani, focuses on strategic investments in the TON ecosystem and aims to bridge traditional capital markets with emerging blockchain infrastructure. Meanwhile, Animoca Brands continues to lead in Web3 advancements, leveraging blockchain and tokenization to advance digital property rights.",blockchain.news,2025-09-30T18:44:09Z,https://blockchain.news/news/animoca-brands-alphaton-capital-strategic-investment-gamee,2025-10-01 18:30:07.976904,0.3803921568627451
Bridgewater's Macro Mastery: Hedge Fund Triumphs Amid Market Shifts | Headlines,"Bridgewater Associates' flagship Pure Alpha fund recorded an 8.1% gain in the third quarter, outperforming major U.S. indexes. The hedge fund's strategic adjustments, including a focus on AI-driven funds, highlight a dynamic approach amid market fluctuations. Led by CEO Nir Bar Dea, Bridgewater continues to navigate global economic challenges effectively. Bridgewater Associates achieved notable success with its flagship Pure Alpha fund, which posted an 8.1% gain in the third quarter, outperforming major U.S. market indexes. The gains coincided with broader market optimism, as investors remained hopeful for Federal Reserve rate cuts. In a strategic pivot, Bridgewater sold all its U.S.-listed Chinese stocks earlier, amid escalating trade tensions. The firm, led by CEO Nir Bar Dea since 2022, has concentrated on streamlining Pure Alpha and launching innovative strategies that leverage artificial intelligence for investment decisions. Bridgewater, now managing $92.1 billion in assets, continues to adapt within global markets, reinforced by strategic leadership from Bar Dea and top executives, Karen Karniol-Tambour, Greg Jensen, and Bob Prince.

Solana Company Secures $500M to Establish Leading Solana (SOL) Treasury,"Pantera Capital, in collaboration with Summer Capital, has announced the successful closure of over $500 million in funding to launch Solana Company, a Solana-backed Digital Asset Treasury (DAT). This initiative, as reported by Pantera Capital, aims to leverage capital markets and onchain activities to maximize SOL per share, providing investors with an optimal exposure to Solana's growth. The Solana Company is set to capitalize on the growing demand for blockchain assets by creating a premier Solana (SOL) treasury. Under the management of Pantera and Summer Capital, the company seeks to provide public market investors with a familiar equity instrument, enhancing their access to Solana's ecosystem. This move comes as part of Pantera's broader strategy to increase institutional and retail engagement with blockchain technology. The foundation of Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies, as explained by Pantera's General Partner Cosmo Jiang, is to generate yield and grow the net asset value per share. This approach potentially offers higher returns compared to holding tokens directly. The success of a DAT is closely tied to the strength of its underlying token, making Solana a strategic choice for the Solana Company. Solana is recognized for its scalability, low transaction costs, and user-friendly infrastructure, making it a preferred platform for consumer applications and decentralized finance. Its technology has attracted interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock and PayPal, which are building on its architecture. The Solana ecosystem's growth is evidenced by its increasing daily active wallets and developer engagement, surpassing even Ethereum and Bitcoin in some metrics. With the anticipated approval of a Solana ETF by late 2025, the adoption of SOL is expected to accelerate. Currently, institutions hold less than 1% of SOL's total supply, suggesting significant potential for growth. The Solana Company aims to bridge public markets with Solana, channeling liquidity into staking and onchain activities to enhance network value and shareholder returns. Under the leadership of Joseph Chee, former Head of Investment Banking, Asia at UBS, and with Pantera as the asset manager, the Solana Company is poised to maximize SOL per share. The company's strategy involves leveraging Solana's design for financial productivity, unlike non-yield-bearing assets like Bitcoin. The launch of Solana Company signifies a pivotal step in providing broader access to blockchain investments through a structured equity vehicle, reflecting Pantera Capital's commitment to pioneering digital asset opportunities.",blockchain.news,2025-09-30T17:56:09Z,https://blockchain.news/news/solana-company-secures-500m-to-establish-leading-solana-sol-treasury,2025-10-01 18:30:07.977283,0.4980392156862745

Novant spends $5 million to add lots near Kernersville Medical Center,"Novant Health Inc. has spent just more than $5 million to purchase five undeveloped tracts totaling 18.44 acres near its Kernersville Medical Center campus. According to a Forsyth County Register of Deeds filing Monday, the properties are: a 10-acre lot listed as 0 Kernersville Medical Parkway; a 4.66-acre lot listed as 0 Kernersville Medical Parkway; a 2.72-acre lot at 1580 Brookford Road; an 0.59-acre lot at 1550 Brookford Road; and an 0.47-acre lot at 1524 Brookford Road. The seller of each property was SLP Reinvestment LLC of Winston-Salem. The purchase could represent the completion of a 14-year plan to create a 70-acre campus with the hospital as its anchor. Novant said in a statement that ""we consistently evaluate opportunities to address future health care needs and invest in property as part of this long-term planning, including recent land purchases in Kernersville."" ""At this time, we do not have detailed plans to share about the use of the land, but will update the community as details develop."" When the Kernersville hospital opened in March 2011 on a 32-acre tract off Kernersville Medical Parkway, Novant said its plans were to eventually have a 77-acre campus in the area. In April 2012, Novant spent $2.1 million to buy 7 acres adjacent to the hospital and next to Macy Grove Road. At that time, the system said it had long-term options to buy another neighboring 30 acres. In October 2012, Novant paid $4 million to buy a 16.7-acre site adjacent to the hospital on its west side. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 The business news you need Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.

This ETF Has Beaten Every Stock in the Magnificent Seven This Year. Is It Too Late to Buy?,"10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF "" The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days. However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far. A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF. However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF. Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks. While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure. The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time. Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate. Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well.

Human error and accidental data breaches: lessons from recent cases - IT Governance Blog,"According to Verizon's 2025 DBIR (Data Breach Investigations Report), some 60% of data breaches now involve ""the human element"" - in other words, errors and non-malicious activity. Failing to use the bcc function when emailing groups of people, accidentally emailing spreadsheets full of unencrypted personal data to entire mailing lists without checking, mistakenly misconfiguring an AWS bucket... each of these simple errors can expose personal information and damage reputations. Recent years have seen several large-scale incidents where accidental disclosure has had significant consequences. These examples show how even organisations with extensive resources and responsibilities can fall victim to basic human error. Examples of accidental breaches Police Service of Northern Ireland, 2023 In August 2023, the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) mistakenly published a spreadsheet online as part of its response to a routine Freedom of Information request. The file contained the names, ranks, locations and departments of every serving police officer and civilian staff member - more than 9,000 individuals in total. The data remained available for several hours before being taken down, but by that time it had been downloaded and shared online. The breach was described as ""monumental"" by local politicians and created severe personal safety concerns for officers, given the ongoing security situation in Northern Ireland. Some officers were forced to move house and change daily routines. The PSNI later apologised, calling the breach an ""unacceptable"" human error. It also faced multiple investigations into how internal processes had failed to prevent such a sensitive file from being released unchecked. The ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) fined the PSNI £750,000 for the breach. Australian Department of Finance, 2024 In February 2024, Australia's Department of Finance admitted that it had accidentally sent a spreadsheet to 236 suppliers that contained sensitive information about other companies. The data, which related to government contracts, was embedded within a pivot table that was not properly cleansed before being circulated. This incident followed a similar error in November 2023, when procurement information was uploaded to the wrong location, exposing details of bids and suppliers. The Department apologised, requested recipients to delete the emails, and undertook a review of its internal practices. The fact that two breaches occurred within a short period highlighted the dangers of systemic weaknesses in how spreadsheets and procurement documents were handled. It also illustrated a recurring problem: the failure to apply technical checks, such as metadata stripping or locked templates, to prevent sensitive information being inadvertently shared. Australian Human Rights Commission, 2025 Between late March and early April 2025, the Australian Human Rights Commission discovered that files uploaded through its website forms had become publicly accessible. Attachments intended to support complaints and submissions - some of them containing highly sensitive information - were inadvertently available online and indexed by search engines. The Commission emphasised that the incident was not the result of a malicious attack, but of a technical misconfiguration. Once the issue was identified, the Commission took down the files and contacted affected individuals. The case shows how easily digital systems can fail if configuration changes or updates are not thoroughly tested. It also demonstrates that data breaches are not limited to email errors but can arise from any point where personal information is collected and stored. ICO guidance on accidental breaches Cases like these show that even experienced organisations can fall victim to simple mistakes. The ICO's latest guidance on personal data breaches sets out clear steps for data controllers to prevent accidental breaches and respond effectively when they occur. Accidental breaches are typically the result of disclosure to the wrong person. Common causes include: Misaddressed emails, often due to the autofill function. Failure to use bcc in bulk communications, exposing all recipients. Spreadsheets circulated without checking for hidden rows, columns or metadata. Files uploaded or shared without confirming access restrictions. What to do when a breach occurs The ICO is clear that speed and accuracy of response are critical. If a breach occurs, the first step should be to notify the data protection officer or nominated individual immediately. Data controllers must then: Record the breach: Keep a full record of the facts, the effects and the remedial action taken, regardless of whether reporting to the ICO is required. Report to the ICO: Notify the regulator without undue delay and within 72 hours, where the breach is likely to affect individuals' rights and freedoms. Notify individuals: Where the risk is high, those affected must also be informed promptly so they can take protective action. Beyond these requirements, organisations should: Act swiftly to contain the breach, such as recalling emails or securing exposed files. Assess the risk and document the likely impact on individuals. Follow internal processes to ensure consistency of response. Investigate root causes and implement changes to prevent recurrence. Why this matters The human consequences of accidental breaches are not abstract, either. Indeed, in some cases, data breaches can put lives at risk. In 2023, the ICO issued a warning after reprimanding seven organisations for data breaches affecting victims of domestic abuse, most of which related to the organisations disclosing the victims' addresses to their alleged abusers. Another high-profile case involved the UK Ministry of Defence, where a spreadsheet containing more than 30,000 resettlement applications from Afghan nationals was mistakenly emailed to an individual outside government. The MOD staff member believed they were sending data on just 150 individuals. The breach exposed names and contact details of people associated with British forces - a mistake that could have had fatal consequences for those affected. Such incidents show why the ICO continues to stress that personal data breaches must be treated with urgency and seriousness. The updated guidance also includes practical resources, such as a checklist on securely disclosing documents and removing hidden information, aimed at reducing avoidable errors. Reducing the human-error risk The DBIR's 60% statistic underlines the scale of the challenge. Most breaches are not the result of external attackers exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, but of ordinary staff carrying out routine tasks. Preventing accidental disclosures requires a blend of policy, training and technical safeguards. Organisations should consider: Email controls: Disable risky autofill features, enforce bcc for bulk mail, and implement pre-send warning systems to flag external recipients or bulk sends. File handling policies: Ensure staff check spreadsheets for hidden data before sharing. Use sanitisation tools to strip metadata and sensitive information. Access control reviews: Regularly audit permissions on shared drives, collaboration platforms and web applications to prevent accidental exposure. Testing and configuration management: Apply robust change control and testing procedures for any system that collects or processes personal data. Staff awareness training: Provide clear, practical training on how breaches occur, using real-world case studies such as the PSNI or MOD. Awareness is more effective when staff see the tangible consequences of mistakes. Incident readiness: Assume mistakes will happen and prepare accordingly. Have policies for reporting, containing and escalating incidents. Rehearse breach scenarios to test readiness and response times. The ICO guidance makes clear that a breach does not always have to be reported, but it must always be recorded. Even where the impact is judged to be low, organisations should use the opportunity to learn and strengthen controls. How IT Governance, a GRC Solutions company, can help The ICO's updated guidance provides a clear framework for how data controllers should respond, from prompt containment and reporting to longer-term preventive action. For organisations, the lesson is simple: people make mistakes, but those mistakes need not become disasters. With effective processes, appropriate safeguards and regular training, the risk of accidental disclosure can be reduced - and when breaches do occur, they can be managed in a way that protects individuals and preserves trust.

Tensions Rise as Pakistan Accused of Militarizing PoJK | International,"Mahmood Kashmiri, Chairman of JKNIA, accuses Pakistan of militarizing Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir, escalating regional tensions. He condemns the weapon distribution to civilians and demands military withdrawal. Kashmiri emphasizes the peaceful nature of the struggle and calls for the arrest of those responsible for violence. Amid escalating tensions, the Chairman of The Jammu and Kashmir National Independence Alliance (JKNIA), Mahmood Kashmiri, has levied serious accusations against Pakistan, alleging that the nation is militarizing Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK). He warns that such actions threaten to destabilize the already fragile region. Kashmiri claims that Pakistani armed forces have besieged the area, strategically positioning troops at crucial entry points and distributing weapons to civilians -- a move he deems a dangerous effort to suppress peaceful resistance. Reports of weapon distribution have emerged from regions like Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot, where Kashmiri connects these developments to a violent incident in Muzaffarabad. This episode allegedly involved a ""Muslim Conference goon,"" purportedly with police assistance, resulting in the deaths of two soldiers and injuries to others. Kashmiri demands accountability, calling for the arrest of Muslim Conference leader Sardar Ateeq. He reaffirms that the movement in PoJK is a peaceful bid for rights, grounded in legal and dignified principles. ""The people's strength is the greatest strength,"" he asserts, insisting that no amount of armed force can silence their voices. In a firm ultimatum to Islamabad, Kashmiri demands the immediate withdrawal of Pakistani troops from PoJK, allowing residents to live tranquilly. He calls for an end to what he describes as ""plans of killing"" peaceful citizens, clarifying that any resultant violence falls on Pakistan's shoulders, not the PoJK government, which he accuses of aligning with Pakistan's interests. He concludes with three critical demands: the removal of Pakistani forces, fulfillment of the rights movement, and the arrest of Sardar Ateeq. Kashmiri warns that continued military presence and civilian armament will deepen unrest, and emphasizes that peaceful resistance cannot be crushed by force. He urges Pakistan's institutions to engage in dialogue to de-escalate the situation and restore peace.",Devdiscourse,2025-10-01T10:08:08Z,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/international/3648580-tensions-rise-as-pakistan-accused-of-militarizing-pojk,2025-10-01 18:30:07.979784,-0.3411764705882353
AOL finally killed dial-up internet yesterday: Will Bitcoin eventually be replaced too?,"Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. AOL discontinued dial-up internet access yesterday, Sept. 30, 2025, ending the access service while AOL Mail and other products remain. According to AOL, the AOL Dialer and AOL Shield are now retired, with instructions for users to transition off legacy connections now posted for support reference. The shutdown affects a tiny fraction of U.S. households and arrives as crypto markets mature through new access channels that change how investors reach Bitcoin without changing what Bitcoin is. The dial-up analogy surfaces whenever markets rotate or infrastructure sunsets, yet dial-up was an access modality to a network, not the network itself. So, in short, no, Bitcoin is not going to be replaced like dial-up has been. However, let's dive into why and where the actual comparison between the internet and Bitcoin adoption remains valid. If there is a parallel to AOL in crypto, it is the set of custodial front ends, exchange on-ramps, and second-layer user experiences that rotate as technology and regulation move. The network that dial-up connected to, the Internet, persisted and scaled across broadband and mobile generations. Per the International Telecommunication Union, about 5.5 billion people, roughly 68 percent of the world, were online in 2024, a reminder that networks expand while edge access changes. The proper crypto mapping treats ETFs, stablecoins, and Layer-2s as access rails that can broaden participation, not as replacements for the base monetary layer. Dial-up's remaining footprint offers a perspective on sunset dynamics. The 2023 American Community Survey counted about 163,401 U.S. households reporting dial-up alone, a heavily rural slice that persisted because of last-mile constraints and price sensitivity. According to the US Census Bureau, those households sit beside far larger shares on mobile broadband and fixed broadband, underscoring that a network's long tail of legacy access can coexist with new rails before finally being retired. Crypto's access mix looks similar in principle, with direct self-custody, exchange custody, programmatic exposure through ETFs, and emerging account-abstraction models all serving the same monetary protocol. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have created a broadband-like on-ramp for institutions and advisors, converting operational hurdles into ticker exposure in brokerage accounts. Per Farside Investors' live tracker, cumulative net inflows since January 2024 now stand north of $60 billion, with flows pulsing alongside macro and positioning rather than vanishing when volatility fades. CoinShares' recent weekly notes through September reported ongoing inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum products, flipping risk on and off week to week while maintaining a durable base of assets under management. The ETF channel does not replace Bitcoin; it replaces operational friction in the way dial-up once gave way to cable, fiber, and 4G, all serving the same Internet. Macro provides the cycle's backdrop. On Sept. 17, the Federal Reserve cut the target range by 25 basis points to 4.00 to 4.25 percent, with officials emphasizing a cautious path that leaves optionality if inflation stalls above target. According to the Fed's implementation note, the standing repo facility and administered rates were adjusted to match the new range, keeping money-market plumbing aligned with policy intent. Inflows into listed products tend to build when real yields stabilize and credit spreads stay orderly, so allocation channels rather than base-layer throughput often set the incremental marginal buyer for Bitcoin in this phase of the cycle. Global crypto ownership sits in the mid-hundreds of millions. According to Triple-A's 2024 report, about 562 million people held crypto last year, with nearly 6.8 percent penetration, with wide regional dispersion and methodology caveats that differ from on-chain counts. Crypto.com's market sizing placed end-2024 ownership closer to 659 million, a reminder that top-down survey-based estimates vary and should be treated as ranges rather than point truths. On-chain activity often diverges from price and AUM, with Glassnode documenting that active address counts remain below 2021 highs even as capital access has broadened through ETFs, a gap consistent with a savings-led cycle rather than a payments-led one. Lightning Network public capacity has drifted down from late-2023 peaks above 5,400 BTC to roughly 4,000 to 4,200 BTC by August 2025, a move that fits an architecture and UX reshuffle as custodial accounts and alternative scaling choices absorb some flows; the live series remains the right reference for current readings. The replacement question is better tested as a set of vectors rather than a slogan. One path is monetary substitution in payments, where stablecoins or future CBDCs dominate transactions while Bitcoin concentrates as a savings instrument. A second is functional abstraction, where layers and custodial accounts mask base-layer complexity much as broadband masked copper and modems for Web users. A third is competition from other L1s in payment or compute niches, which does not automatically dislodge Bitcoin's store-of-value role if institutional rails and custody continue to harden. Each path is observable with data, including ETP flows, wallet counts, stablecoin settlement, and layer capacity. Per Farside and CoinShares, the capital rail is the clearest change so far. Policy remains the swing factor, including stablecoin legislation, bank connectivity, and ETP rule adjustments that could slow flows even if demand is intact. Macro can reprice allocations quickly if inflation stalls above target or re-accelerates, which would pressure the Fed's easing path and lift real yields, a setup that historically cools inflows into long-duration risk. Network structure deserves monitoring, especially pool concentration. According to b10c's 2025 analysis, roughly six mining pools account for more than 95 percent of recent blocks, which is pool concentration rather than ultimate asset ownership but still relevant for transaction selection, fee dynamics, and potential MEV concerns. Execution risk shows up in Lightning routing concentration and channel management, which should be assessed next to growth in off-channel and custodial usage rather than read as a singular demand gauge. Allocation and penetration scenarios frame 2026 to 2030 without resorting to price targets. A conservative path assumes about 0.5 percent allocation from global investable assets into Bitcoin across ETFs, corporate treasuries, and HNW custody, yielding hundreds of billions of potential demand over a full cycle, with choppy pacing if inflation surprises. A base case uses a one percent allocation that, over time, creates a trillion-plus demand capacity if custody, clearing, and advisory workflows keep integrating Bitcoin. An aspirational case in the two to two and a half percent range requires benign macro, scalable market plumbing, and clear policy, which would be equivalent to multi-trillion dollar capacity over the cycle. On the user side, slow, base, and fast tracks range from about one billion to more than two billion crypto owners by 2030, depending on mobile wallet integrations, regulatory clarity, and the split between savings and payments. The ITU baseline helps position those ranges on the adoption curve, since the world's Internet penetration already sits near the upper half of the S-curve. Framed this way, the end of dial-up clarifies the debate. Access layers come and go as distribution, regulation, and user experience improve, while the network or monetary base can endure. ETFs, stablecoins, and Layer-2s operate like broadband for capital and transactions, expanding the addressable base for savings and settlement without requiring a replacement for Bitcoin itself. AOL's original dial-up service is off, but the Internet is still on.",CryptoSlate,2025-10-01T10:11:29Z,https://cryptoslate.com/aol-finally-killed-dial-up-internet-yesterday-will-bitcoin-eventually-be-replaced-too/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.980532,0.08235294117647052

Budget 2026 Must Fix the Unfair Tax Blocking Families from Investing,"Budget 2026 Must Fix the Unfair Tax Blocking Families from Investing Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty has urged the government to use Budget 2026 to reduce the harsh tax on Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and introduce tax incentives that will encourage more Irish savers to become investors. ""Right now, families that try to invest in their future are being punished by the most unfair tax in Europe,"" Doherty said. ""If you put money into an ETF, a simple, low-cost fund that spreads your risk across shares or bonds, you get hit with a massive 41% tax bill. On top of that, every eight years you're forced to pay tax even if you haven't sold. It's absurd and it discourages families from doing the right thing."" Doherty noted ""across Ireland, billions are sitting in deposit accounts earning next to nothing. Families across Europe hold more than €10 trillion in bank deposits. While safe, those savings often deliver very poor returns, especially when inflation is high. At the same time, Europe needs up to €800 billion in new investment every year by 2030 to fund the green and digital transitions, innovation, and security."" ""The Government talks a lot about competitiveness. But competitiveness isn't just about corporation tax or multinationals,"" Doherty said. ""It's about whether ordinary families can invest for college fees, their first home, or retirement without being punished by unfair rules."" The European Union is working towards a new Savings and Investments Union (SIU) to make it easier for families to grow their money through investment. ""Brussels is moving forward,"" Doherty said. ""Ireland is holding its own people back. Budget 2026 must change that."" ""This isn't complicated,"" Doherty concluded. ""If we want Irish families to build wealth, we need to stop punishing them for trying. Budget 2026 is the Government's chance to finally get this right.""",Dublin People,2025-10-01T10:14:24Z,https://dublinpeople.com/news/dublin/articles/2025/10/01/doherty-budget-26-invest/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.981079,-0.1607843137254902
How federal government shutdown will impact visitors to US,"On 1 October 2025 at one minute past midnight local time in Washington DC, a shutdown of the US federal government began. The Democrats refused to vote for President Trump's bill to continue federal spending without an extension of health care tax credits. The White House website currently says ""Democrats Have Shut Down the Government"". The political paralysis in Washington DC will affect tourists to the US, whether they hope to explore the museums in the American capital or the natural wonders of the national parks. These are the key impacts for travellers. Yes. The Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, as used by most British holidaymakers and business visitors to the US, will continue to function as normal; it is self-financing (and the fee almost doubled on the last day of September). Yes. Along with other front-line workers who keep air transport moving, air-traffic controllers will continue to work - though without pay - because they are ""necessary to protect life and property"". The Department of Transportation says 13,294 air-traffic controllers will be available for work. Air accident investigators will continue to be on call. But activities such as ""random drug testing of the non-safety workforce"" will end, along with social media activities. At the Department of Homeland Security, which looks after airport security as well as Customs and Border Protection, only nine per cent of staff - in back-office roles - will stop working. The remainder are classed as essential workers. Processing of international arrivals will continue as normal, as will screening of airline passengers boarding flights in the US. But even though front-line staff continue to turn up, a technical failure that affected airport processing could cause problems for travellers. The trade body Airlines For America says: ""The system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency."" Given the number of cyberattacks on the travel industry recently, it is noteworthy that only one-third of the staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will keep working - at the start of what is officially Cybersecurity Awareness Month. In July 1,000 staff at CISA were fired as part of the campaign for ""government efficiency"". The federal government must stop paying staff for duties that are classed as ""non-essential"". This covers many tourist facilities. Anything run by the National Park Service (NPS) is particularly vulnerable; two thirds of staff will be stood down. The service says: ""Park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors."" But facilities from ranger-guided walks to restrooms will not be available, and some parks will close altogether. America's greatest collection of museums, the Smithsonian in Washington DC, says its venues as well as the National Zoo in the capital will remain open until next Monday, 6 October, using ""prior-year funds"". But there is no certainty after that. The US Travel Association, representing the travel industry, says: ""The travel economy is at risk of losing $1 billion a week due to disruptions in air and rail travel and the closure of national parks and museums."" Only if you are on a specialist package holiday rendered difficult by the government shutdown - for example a cultural tour of the Smithsonian Museums in Washington DC, or an adventure in a national park - would you have the right to cancel or postpone. Most package holidays to the US, together with all independently organised trips, will not qualify for free amendment or cancellation.",The Independent,2025-10-01T09:58:30Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/us-government-shutdown-esta-visa-cancellations-refunds-b2837145.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.981501,0.1607843137254903
Milan Rewarding Lecce Handsomely to Develop Camarda,"Milan product Francesco Camarda scored his first Serie A goal during the weekend with a late header, allowing Lecce to pick up a precious point against Bologna. The two sides agreed to a convoluted deal during the summer to make sure that the starlet would see regular playing time, Mattia Moretto reports (via MSN). The Salentini technically hold a €3M option to buy, but the Rossoneri can counter and retain him for €3.8M. It's standard remuneration for contributing to the player's growth. The San Siro-based team didn't stop there, though. The Giallorossi are receiving valorization bonuses for each appearance, €75k, and every goal, €100k. Camarda has started twice in the first five rounds but has featured in every tilt, splitting duties with Leo Stulic, the other striker signed by Lecce following the departure of Nenad Krstovic. The two starred together only for a brief portion of the Cagliari tilt. Milan almost lost the prodigy during the negotiation to prolong his contract in March 2024. Manchester United, Roma, and Borussia Dortmund tried to convince him to jump ship, and Modena wanted to acquire him outright during the summer, but he decided to remain loyal. He's now tied to the Rossoneri until 2028. They better have inserted some minute-related caveats; otherwise, the disbursement could be relatively hefty, and some of his appearances could be token just to pocket the money. He's very raw, but he's only 17 after all, and he didn't play as much as he should have in the Futuro squad in 2024/2025. Still, he has a nose for the goal, and that's a good foundation to start from for a center-forward.",The Cult of Calcio,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://cultofcalcio.com/milan-rewarding-lecce-handsomely-to-develop-camarda/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.981685,0.2862745098039217
Selencky Parsons builds South Downs home that looks like three cottages,"London studio Selencky Parsons has completed Bulls Barn, a family home in the south of England that looks like a cluster of small buildings. Located in the South Downs National Park, the house was designed to resemble a trio of cottages, with walls that combine terracotta-toned clay tiles with raw flint. By dividing up the building volume, Selencky Parsons was able to make the house feel cosy and intimate despite its 540-square-metre size. The aim was to create a practical home for the owners - a couple with grown-up children - while also making it easy for the extended family to frequently come and stay. ""The broken-down massing is also designed to allow the house to nestle comfortably into its landscape setting amongst the existing mature trees on the site,"" said architect and studio co-founder David Parsons. ""From the surrounding fields, the house is viewed more as a collection of smaller structures with varying roof orientations set within the trees, rather than one overbearing large house,"" he told Dezeen. There is a clear distinction between the upper and lower volumes of the three-storey property, highlighted by the change in materials. The clay-tile-clad upper volumes are more clearly split into three blocks, each with a gabled roof. One functions as a self-contained two-bedroom flat, while a further six bedrooms are distributed across the other two. The ground-floor layout is more fluid. The flint walls are interspersed with large expanses of glazing, creating a more flexible arrangement of communal family rooms. The architects chose flint because it is readily available in this part of the country. ""Flint has traditionally been used to build walls for centuries,"" said Parsons. ""Farmers remove flint from the surrounding fields, so it is essentially a waste product."" ""It also provides an ideal textured backdrop to the landscape planting that surrounds the house,"" he added. The most striking use of flint is on two chimney breasts. These extend up alongside two of the three gabled blocks, providing a fireplace for the living room and another in between the dining room and snug. ""Chimneys are traditionally made from stone, but using flint for the fireplaces gave the opportunity to bring that beautiful rural texture into the interior in a controlled way,"" said Parsons. ""It's a bold statement that helps to define the living spaces and bring character."" The rest of the interior is more neutral, with stone floors connecting the ground-floor rooms with patio terraces, and timber flooring and joinery offering moments of warmth. ""You are constantly aware of the fantastic views to the South Downs, which vary in scale from the large glazed expanse of the entrance atrium, to the long landscape window seat in the kitchen or to a simple window opening in a guest bedroom,"" added Parsons. ""These views are drawn into the interior and provide a continual presence throughout the house."" The building replaces a 1960s house that was deemed unworthy of renovation. The new structure was designed to be carbon-neutral in its use, with solar panels, rainwater harvesting, triple glazing and a ground source heat pump all included in the scheme. Parsons sees the project as a good example of how homes can be designed for varied occupation. Other examples in the studio's portfolio include Bravura House and The Coach House. ""Despite its large overall size, the house does feel homely and sensitively scaled as you move through its sequence of interior spaces,"" he added.",Dezeen,2025-10-01T10:15:00Z,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/01/selencky-parsons-bulls-barn-house/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.981981,0.2078431372549019

TBRS 2025 concludes setting the stage for a new era of branded living in India - BW Hotelier,"TBRS 2025 established itself as the focal point of India's branded residences movement, a space that is fast evolving from niche luxury to mainstream aspiration The recently concluded Branded Residences Summit (TBRS) 2025 made a historic debut at Mumbai's Jio World Convention Centre, setting the stage for a new era of branded living in India. Hosted by NOESIS Hotel Advisors, the summit gathered the most influential voices from real estate, hospitality, design, capital, and luxury lifestyle industries. In just one day, TBRS 2025 established itself as the focal point of India's branded residences movement, a space that is fast evolving from niche luxury to mainstream aspiration. Over 175 delegates from across India and beyond converged at the summit, representing cities as diverse as Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, and emerging markets such as Amritsar, Lucknow, Kanpur, and Nasik. The presence of global leaders from the UAE, Singapore, Thailand, the UK, Germany, and Spain underscored India's rising status as the nerve centre of the global branded residences market. Their participation affirmed the scale of opportunity and the confidence international stakeholders place in India's branded living sector. The programme featured keynote addresses, fireside chats, and high-powered panels with industry leaders from ITC Hotels, IHCL, Marriott, Accor, Hilton, Banyan Tree, Radisson, and Hyatt. They shared the stage with India's most ambitious developers, including Shapoorji Pallonji, Rustomjee, Raheja, Gulshan Group, Tribeca, Whiteland, AMPA Group, and M3M. Conversations cut deep into the mechanics of this evolving asset class, ranging from capital structuring and deal engineering to design innovation, buyer psychology, and regulatory frameworks. A clear consensus emerged: branded residences have outgrown the image of being aspirational luxuries. They are now recognized as an inevitable force shaping the future of Indian real estate. A major highlight of the summit was the launch of the second edition of NOESIS' landmark study, Landscape of Branded Residences in India - 2025. The report showcased India's meteoric growth in this sector, revealing a pipeline of more than 4,000 operational and planned units across key cities -- triple the supply compared to a decade ago. It also revealed that branded projects enjoy 1.5 to 2 times faster sales velocity than non-branded luxury developments, while consistently commanding premiums of 15 to 40 percent. These figures validated the growing role of brand trust as a new form of real estate currency. Nandivardhan Jain, Founder and CEO of NOESIS, framed this transformation with clarity and conviction. ""India has entered its branded moment,"" he said. ""Branded residences are no longer just luxury - they are a mainstream asset class. Developers are chasing velocity, brands demand protection, capital providers seek predictability, and customers above all want trust. TBRS is the first-ever platform aligning these four stakeholders to unleash India's branded living revolution. Branded living is not just rich thinking; it is an instrument to buy back your time - by using your resources wisely, you are buying back your time."" The summit's finale captured its forward-looking energy. The unveiling of Branded Launchpad, a first-of-its-kind framework to accelerate branded residential developments, provided developers and investors with a concrete roadmap for execution. This was followed by a red-carpet networking gala that became a hub of deal-making, collaborations, and partnerships poised to shape Indian real estate over the next decade. The NOESIS report also placed India firmly on the global stage, projecting that the country will contribute over 20 percent of Asia-Pacific's branded residences supply by 2030, ranking alongside Thailand and the UAE. While non-hotel brands currently lead the sector with 63 percent of projects, hospitality brands account for 37 percent and are rapidly expanding, signaling fresh innovation and competition. Geographically, the report highlighted how Mumbai and Delhi NCR remain the established hubs driving inventory and pricing benchmarks. Yet, it is the emerging markets -- Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Indore, Surat, and Goa -- that are fueling the next wave of expansion, proving that branded living is no longer confined to metropolitan elites but is spreading across India's growth corridors.",BW Hotelier,2025-10-01T10:15:30Z,https://www.bwhotelier.com/article/tbrs-2025-concludes-setting-the-stage-for-a-new-era-of-branded-living-in-india-573801,2025-10-01 18:30:07.982490,0.2392156862745098
"GSF flotilla expected to enter red zone near Gaza at 9pm, says Fahmi","PUTRAJAYA: The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) humanitarian mission currently sailing in international waters is expected to enter the R3 red zone, about 100 nautical miles from Gaza, at 9pm Malaysian time, says Datuk Fahmi Fadzil. The Communications Minister said the Sumud Nusantara Command Centre (SNCC) reported that the flotilla, which was now in the yellow zone, also faced a tense situation at 8.45am (Malaysian time) on Wednesday when approached by what is believed to be an Israeli vessel. ""GSF boats are expected to enter the red zone within a few hours and the presence of the vessel is concerning,"" he said at a weekly press conference here on Wednesday. Fahmi also said about 10 drones were detected hovering over the flotilla but no physical interception had taken place and the flotilla delegation remains on alert. He said that if the boats are intercepted and communication cut off, several measures had been prepared and would be activated according to procedure. ""The movement (of the GSF mission) is being broadcast live via closed-circuit television (CCTV) installed on the vessels for the world to watch in the event of any incident. ""We pray for the success of the mission and for the safety of all participants. We must continue to help build the narrative in support of peace in Gaza and also ensure this effort achieves success,"" he said. Fahmi said that apart from the two GSF groups already in the yellow zone, there was also a third group involving a Malaysian team on its way that would depart from Greece soon. ""With the third wave, the number of Malaysian participants will be larger. For their families here (in Malaysia), assistance will be provided and if anything happens, the government will certainly provide immediate assistance for the participants,"" he said. Fahmi said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim visited the SNCC on Tuesday (Sept 30) and informed that several forms of assistance had been arranged, including for the families of the 34 Malaysian participants. Asked about Malaysia's stance regarding the latest peace framework proposed by the United States on Gaza, Fahmi said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi would be issuing an official statement on the matter. A total of 34 Malaysians have joined the GSF mission, which involves activists from 45 countries sailing to Gaza to break the blockade. The flotilla had earlier faced various obstacles, including drone attacks. Malaysia became the first country to recognise the mission through the support of Anwar. The GSF voyage across the Mediterranean Sea carries food, medicine and a message of peace, urging an end to war and famine while also demanding the opening of a humanitarian corridor to Gaza. - Bernama",The Star ,2025-10-01T10:15:33Z,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/10/01/gsf-flotilla-expected-to-enter-red-zone-near-gaza-tonight-says-fahmi,2025-10-01 18:30:07.982724,0.1450980392156862
JPJ completes probe into fatal Bukit Kajang toll plaza crash,"HULU SELANGOR: The Road Transport Department (JPJ) has completed its report on the fatal crash at the Bukit Kajang Toll Plaza, which claimed the life of a baby and injured seven others. JPJ Senior Director of Enforcement Datuk Muhammad Kifli Ma Hassan said inspections and a Road Safety Audit (JISA) on the logistics company operating the lorry involved have also been completed. ""The investigation has been fully completed and an audit was carried out on the company... the report has been submitted to the minister (Transport Minister Anthony Loke) today before he makes an announcement,"" he told a press conference at the JPJ Enforcement Station in Kalumpang here on Wednesday (Oct 1). The accident last Saturday (Sept 27) involved a lorry believed to have experienced brake failure, a car and two sport utility vehicles (SUVs), resulting in the death of a one-year-old boy and injuries to seven individuals. Yesterday, Kajang OCPD Asst Comm Naazron Abdul Yusof said police had recorded statements from seven individuals to assist in the investigation and that the investigation papers had also been referred to the Public Prosecutor. Naazron said action against the lorry driver's employer was also being reviewed with the relevant agencies, and the lorry involved would be sent for inspection by the Chemistry Department and Puspakom this Thursday to determine the cause of the accident. According to Naazron, the lorry driver, who had been remanded to assist with investigations, would be released on police bail on Wednesday pending the full report and analysis, with the case being investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987. In a separate development, Muhammad Kifli said summonses totalling RM130mil had been settled by road users since January, involving various offences, including those under the Automated Awareness Safety System (Awas). Regarding the installation of Awas cameras at the Menora Tunnel in Perak, he said it has successfully raised awareness among motorists, thereby reducing the rate of road accidents at the location. ""Previously, the area recorded accidents almost every week, but after the installation of Awas, the number of cases dropped significantly, and for nearly two months no accidents have been recorded, whereas before they occurred almost weekly,"" he said. Meanwhile, Muhammad Kifli said a popular motivational speaker with a large social media following has been detained after being found using a modified vehicle number plate to evade detection by the Road Transport Department's (JPJ) Automated Awareness Safety System (Awas). He said the 50-year-old man was found using a genuine registration number on the front of his sport utility vehicle (SUV), but had fitted a nearly identical number plate at the rear, omitting one letter to confuse the Awas system. He said the speaker's actions resulted in traffic summonses amounting to more than RM12,600, accumulated since September 2023, being issued to the owner of the nearly identical number plate. ""This case came to light after the owner of the nearly identical registration number from Perlis was blacklisted over offences not committed by him. ""The original owner lodged a report after being blacklisted for offences he did not commit, and our investigation revealed that the offences were actually committed by another vehicle of the same type and model but in a different colour,"" he said. Muhammad Kifli said following intelligence gathering and investigations, JPJ detained the 50-year-old man along with the vehicle at the North-South Expressway near the Behrang Rest and Service Area at 9.30pm last Saturday. The case is being investigated under Section 108(3)(f) of the Road Transport Act 1987. - Bernama",The Star ,2025-10-01T10:15:33Z,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/10/01/jpj-completes-probe-into-fatal-bukit-kajang-toll-plaza-crash,2025-10-01 18:30:07.983039,-0.2549019607843137

"Punjab flood crisis threatens surplus, Pakistan seeks IMF support - Daily Times","Pakistan has started its second half-yearly economic review talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Officials briefed the IMF on key indicators like growth, inflation, remittances, exports, and flood damages. The Finance Ministry reported a growth rate of 3.7% to 4%, slightly below the 4.2% target. Inflation for the year is forecast at 7%, while September inflation is expected to be between 3.5% and 4.5%. Rising flood-related costs could push prices up in the coming months. Punjab, along with other provinces, joined the discussions to share their fiscal progress. However, Punjab declined to declare a budget surplus. It cited severe flood damage as the main reason and said victim relief will be funded through provincial resources. This move may impact Pakistan's ability to meet fiscal targets under its agreement with the IMF. An official damage report is being prepared, and the IMF has asked for a final version soon. : IMF, Pakistan kick off discussions for $8.4bn loan programmes Despite these challenges, officials shared some positive economic signals with the IMF. Remittances are expected to hit a record $43 billion this fiscal year. This would exceed the budget target of $39.4 billion. The increase is largely due to contributions from overseas Pakistanis, especially those helping with flood recovery in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On the fiscal front, provinces are required to contribute a combined budget surplus of Rs1,464 billion. Last year, they fell short by Rs280 billion. Punjab's refusal to commit a surplus adds pressure on federal finances. Meanwhile, Sindh estimates flood damage at Rs50 billion, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Rs30 billion, and Balochistan reports minimal losses. Pakistan's external economic indicators show a mixed outlook. The current account deficit is expected to stay around $1 billion, which is better than the $2.1 billion target. Exports may reach $34.2 billion, just under the $35.2 billion goal, while imports are projected to hit $65 billion. The IMF will closely watch these numbers as talks continue.",Daily Times,2025-10-01T10:15:13Z,https://dailytimes.com.pk/1377111/punjab-flood-crisis-threatens-surplus-pakistan-seeks-imf-support/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.983563,0.1058823529411765

A 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder in Delhi now costs Rs 1,595.50, an increase of Rs 15.50 from Rs 1,580 earlier, according to data from the Indian Oil Corporation. The revised prices are Rs 1,700.50 in Kolkata, Rs 1,547 in Mumbai and Rs 1,754.50 in Chennai. There is no change in the price of domestic LPG cylinders. ATF rates have seen a sharper increase. In Delhi, the price rose by Rs 3,052.50 per kilolitre to Rs 93,766.02 from Rs 90,713.52. In Kolkata, ATF costs Rs 96,816.58, while the new rates are Rs 87,714.39 in Mumbai and Rs 97,302.14 in Chennai. The revisions are part of the monthly review conducted by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, which adjust LPG and jet fuel prices in line with global benchmarks and currency exchange rates. Petrol and diesel prices have remained steady since March 2024, when both were cut by Rs 2 per litre ahead of the general elections. Petrol currently sells for Rs 94.72 per litre in Delhi, while diesel costs Rs 87.62. Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said last month that the government's Rs 30,000-crore compensation package for oil companies, cleared by the Cabinet in August, had helped keep household LPG prices stable despite global volatility.

2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Too Cheap to Ignore,"Dividend stocks are popular investing options that historically outperform non-dividend-paying stocks. They tend to offer investors a steady and transparent income stream, and are often more resilient to economic downturns. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue "" Let's take a look at two high-yield dividend stocks paying investors handsomely to risk near-term headwinds in the businesses. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Target (NYSE: TGT) has huge name recognition thanks to its position as the U.S.'s seventh-largest retailer. It offers a more upscale in-store shopping experience and a range of products from apparel, home goods, and essentials. It also boasts over 1,900 stores in the U.S. and generates over $100 billion annually in sales. The popular retailer is under pressure of late amid a weaker consumer spending environment and tough competition, but the company does have some tailwinds. Target should benefit from the ongoing decline of mall-based competition and department stores, which should help drive same-store sales higher in the medium term. Further, Target focuses on a more affluent customer with an average household income of roughly $79,000, according to GlobalData, much higher than rival Walmart at $62,000. Target also quelled some fears that the retailer couldn't compete online with the likes of juggernauts Amazon and Walmart, because during the COVID-19 pandemic, it managed to navigate difficult waters through in-store renovations and digital growth -- its sales surged 40% from 2019 through 2022. Also helping in that department is Target's advantageous locations. The retailer's stores are located within 10 miles of 75% of the U.S. population, enabling a ""stores as hubs"" distribution business where stores can fulfill 97% of total sales. Target's dividend is considered safe and reliable in part because the company has a 54-year streak of dividend growth, making it a Dividend King. Its dividend payout ratio, around 55%, is quite manageable and supported by consistent profitability and strong free cash flow. While headwinds will remain in the near future, its iconic brand, more affluent consumers, and a more upscale experience compared to low-cost retailers, should continue driving foot traffic long term. Despite the headwinds, Target feels too cheap to ignore trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 11 times, and offering investors a juicy 5.1% dividend yield. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has a lot on its plate right now. The vehicle manufacturer is currently busy setting a full-year record for recalls, which have reared their ugly head in the recent past and dinged earnings. It's also facing increasing competition in China, tariff uncertainty, and currently wildly unprofitable electric vehicles. That said, the company has made substantial improvements in closing the cost gap between itself and its rivals. ""We recorded our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year cost improvement, excluding the impact of tariffs, building on progress we made last year when we closed roughly $1.5 billion of our competitive cost gap in material cost. Our balance sheet keeps getting stronger, further enabling our ability to invest in areas of strength. We are remaking Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin, and more durable business ... ,"" said Ford CFO Sherry House in an earnings press release. Speaking of those higher margins, let's highlight the shining star of Ford's business currently: Ford Pro, responsible for its commercial sales. Consider that the Ford Pro segment generated $3.6 billion earnings before interest and taxes during the first half of 2025 at a strong 10.7% EBIT margin. That compares very favorably to its Ford Blue segment, responsible for its traditional business, which posted $757 million EBIT during the first half of 2025, at a more paltry 1.6% EBIT margin. In fairness, both of those segments compare favorably to its Model e division, responsible for its electric vehicles, which lost more than $2.1 billion during the first half of 2025. The good news is that Ford Pro stands to improve its high-margin business as software, physical services, and paid subscriptions grow. Ford Pro paid subscriptions grew 24% year over year to 757,000. Ford has problems to solve, but it's a tempting investment as it trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 15 times and offers investors not only a 5.1% dividend yield, but often dishes out an annual supplemental dividend to further return value to shareholders. The business also operates in such a way that Ford's dividend is considered reliable and safe. We have to be fair about this; neither of these stocks is an absolute no-brainer investment. Both face very real headwinds, operate in cutthroat retail industries, and lack durable competitive advantages. However, especially for income investors, the upside at these valuations is likely worth a small position, with both companies offering safe dividends yielding 5%-plus.

"There's a Bubble Forming in the Stock Market, but It's Not in Artificial Intelligence (AI). History Says This Happens Next.","Emerging technology stocks, on the other hand, look unjustifiably expensive. It's been nearly three years since ChatGPT was launched, and stocks have been rallying at breakneck speed ever since. There is some evidence that a bubble could be forming in the S&P 500. After all, the index is unusually expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the CAPE ratio, which adjusts for inflation, is even more expensive. The so-called Buffett indicator, a ratio of the S&P 500's market cap to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is also at an all-time high. However, the AI stocks leading this charge aren't as expensive as you might think. The chart below shows five of the leading AI stocks. Although none of those stocks are cheap, they are mostly in line with the S&P 500, and all are delivering double-digit percentage growth. Nvidia, which is the most expensive of the group, is also the fastest growing, and its revenue is forecast to grow by 56% in its next quarterly report. Image source: Getty Images. Rather than in large-cap stocks, the bubble forming in the stock market appears to be happening in zero-revenue, emerging technology stocks, and it's reminiscent of earlier stock market bubbles. For example, in the dot-com era, droves of small internet companies went public with little or no revenue and unproven business models. That helped hasten the bust in 2000. During the pandemic era, we saw a similar phenomenon with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), nearly all of which crashed or went bankrupt, even though they generally had successful debuts. Other emerging technology stocks with little revenue, like electric vehicles, mostly went bankrupt or crashed in that era. Even the higher-profile newcomers like Rivian and Lucid lost more than 90% of their value. This time around, there are a number of emerging sectors that are demonstrating similar trends. For example, modular nuclear reactor company Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) has jumped 1,200% during the past year even though the company has no revenue and doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least late 2027. It is currently attempting to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and has not sold a purchase agreement yet. Oklo currently has a market cap of almost $17 billion. Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are another sector that has gotten frothy despite minimal revenue. Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR), which also has no revenue, currently trades at a market cap of $6 billion. Finally, quantum computing stocks have soared this year, even though that sector is still producing little or no revenue. One stock, Quantum Computing (NASDAQ: QUBT), is up nearly 3,000% during the past year and its market cap has reached $3.7 billion, though it expects to generate less than $1 million in revenue this year. Investor enthusiasm for AI stocks seems to have carried over to emerging technology sectors that are unproven, much as it did in the dot-com era and during the pandemic. Although companies like Oklo and Archer Aviation have potential, their current valuations don't seem to factor in the downside risk in the stock. It's likely to take years to build significant revenue, and even if they get there, that's not a guarantee of success. In thecurrent stock market any of these stocks could crash if investor sentiment starts to shift. For the businesses to grow into their valuations without a major pullback seems unlikely. Before you buy stock in Oklo, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oklo wasn't one of them.

"RBI Eases Lending Rules, Allows Banks To Finance Acquisitions - BW Businessworld","The regulatory ceiling on lending against listed debt securities will be removed, while banks' lending limits against shares will rise from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore per person The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday declared fresh relaxations for banks, including permission to finance corporate acquisitions and eased restrictions on lending against listed shares. Governor Sanjay Malhotra, in his post-MPC address, said the RBI will introduce an enabling framework allowing banks to support acquisition financing by Indian corporates. As part of the measures, the regulatory ceiling on lending against listed debt securities will be removed, while banks' lending limits against shares will rise from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore per person. Similarly, the cap on IPO financing will be raised from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh per person. The move follows requests from lenders, including the State Bank of India, seeking greater flexibility in acquisition financing. Malhotra also said that the stricter expected credit loss (ECL) framework would take effect only from 2027, giving banks a glide path for compliance. The Basel III capital framework will also come into force from the same year, he added.",BW Businessworld,2025-10-01T10:15:30Z,https://www.businessworld.in/article/rbi-eases-lending-rules-allows-banks-to-finance-acquisitions-573803,2025-10-01 18:30:07.985221,0.3490196078431373
GST 2.0 And Its Impact On The Experiential Industry: Can We Expect A Bumper Diwali?,"Ankur Kalra, Founder & CEO of VIBGYOR, on how GST 2.0 Paves the Way for Experiential Spending, Promising a Festival Season Focused on Memories Over Material Spending patterns in India are changing as we progress further into 2025. With GST 2.0, everyday goods and services, including essential goods and services are becoming cheaper, while luxury products will now attract higher taxes. This shift isn't just about policy but about behaviour. When essentials cost less, people have more disposable income. When luxury items get pricier, consumers start asking: What's truly worth spending on? The answer more often lies in experiences. A product loses value over time. An experience stays. A live concert, a weekend getaway, a food festival, a cultural event, or a wellness retreat; these are moments that build memories. bonds, and emotions. With reduced GST on leisure and lifestyle services, such experiences are now more affordable and accessible. For the experiential industry, this is an opening. Lower taxes will drive more participation in festivals, concerts, cultural events, and workshops. For brands, this is a chance to move beyond visibility and focus on deeper connections to create experiences that engage and leave an impact. MSMEs and start-ups, too, will benefit as curation costs come down, allowing more innovation and variety to increase visibility in the sector. Globally, as societies grow, people shift from buying possessions to seeking meaning. India is no different. GST 2.0 accelerates that shift from ownership to participation, from things to moments. Importantly enough, the timing is golden. With Diwali around the corner, consumers are likely to direct their festive spending towards experiences that bring people together: travel, concerts, dining, or culture-led activations. This season may mark the beginning of a new festive tradition: choosing memories over material, creating a bumper season for the experiential industry, and setting a new standard for how we make people experience and live festivals. At Vibgyor, we have always believed that experiences are the strongest way to connect people with brands, and GST 2.0 strengthens this belief. For the industry as a whole, it's not just about a bumper festive season but the start of a long-term shift where experiences take the centre stage for how India celebrates and engages.",Everything Experiential,2025-10-01T10:15:30Z,https://everythingexperiential.com/article/gst-2-0-and-its-impact-on-the-experiential-industry-can-we-expect-a-bumper-diwali-573804,2025-10-01 18:30:07.985428,0.2156862745098038
"""Govt stands with the affected"": Haryana CM announces Rs 4.72 crore flood relief","Chandigarh (Haryana) [India], October 1 (ANI): Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Saini has announced relief measures for areas affected by recent heavy rainfall and flooding in the state on Wednesday. Due to the excessive rainfall, several districts faced a flood-like situation, resulting in damage to crops, loss of lives, and property.

USD/JPY: Technical Breakdown at 147.50 Signals Start of Potential Bearish Trend | Investing.com UK,"Looking for actionable trade ideas to navigate the current market volatility? here to unlock access to InvestingPro's AI-selected stock winners. The US dollar index has come under pressure this week, with USD/JPY emerging as one of the strongest performers across FX market. The latest leg lower in US dollar has been fuelled in part by falling US bond yields, while a slide in oil prices, which tends to benefit energy importers like Japan, has also helped to support the yen. But more to the point, it is the US government shutdown which is keeping the US dollar under pressure across the board. Markets are now weighing up the prospect of an extended stalemate, which could sap consumer confidence and deepen concerns over job security. The US dollar index has been edging lower in recent days, with traders keeping one eye on the budget standoff in Washington. Overnight, the greenback took another knock, slipping in the wake of Washington's failure to avert a government shutdown. Truth be told, this was mostly expected, but the fact that it has happened means there would be a delay for the release of critical jobs data this week, leaving the Fed flying blind on the labour market. Consequently, any near-term US dollar recovery attempts could fade. Rate expectations have already shifted. Traders are pricing around two rate cuts by year-end and over 100 basis points by 2026. This is still slightly less than what markets expected earlier this month. That repricing reflects a tug-of-war between an improving near-term US data pulse and lingering doubts over labour market strength. This means that the risks are tilted to further downside for the US dollar in the event of data disappointment this week. Yesterday, the focus was on the JOLTS job openings data, with expectations for little change. However, it showed a bit of improvement to 7.23m from 7.18m the month before. Nonetheless, the US dollar fell further, possibly because of shutdown fears and the fact that the day's other data releases were soft. Indeed, the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures, which were seen ticking lower, were confirmed, but the drop was bigger than expected at 94.2 vs. 96.0 eyed and 97.8 previous. On top of this, the Chicago PMI disappointed at 40.6 vs. 43.3 expected, and down from 41.5 previously. The Japanese yen appears to be the primary beneficiary of the latest government shutdown, which officially began overnight, and hopes of a quick resolution appear slim. The USD/JPY has dropped to 147.00 handle. Democrats appear to be bracing for a longer fight, positioning themselves as defenders of healthcare ahead of next year's mid-terms, while Republicans, with control of the congressional agenda and the backing of the White House, show little appetite to compromise. The main concern here is that with an already-weakening consumer confidence and a gloomier jobs outlook, the shutdown could exacerbate these trends if it lasts more than just a few days. If President Trump follows through on threats to dismiss non-essential staff, then as many as 150,000 layoffs could distort upcoming payroll data, with October's NFP in particular at risk. In the meantime, regular economic reporting will also be disrupted. While the US dollar struggles, the yen is quietly gaining across the board. The GBP/JPY, for example, has slipped to 198.00 after failing to hold the psychological 200.00 level and amid budget uncertainty in the UK, while the CAD/JPY is under pressure as oil prices extend their slide since the start of the week. What's more, the Bank of Japan has signalled it is edging towards tightening, while the Fed is moving in the opposite direction with cuts already in play. That means bond yield differential could narrow further in favor of the yen, potentially creating a bearish USD/JPY trend. From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY chart is starting to show a few bearish signs again after being neutral for much of the summer. The pair has been choppy for months -- flat in June, higher in July, lower in August, and then bouncing in early September. In the last few days, however, sellers have regained the upper hand, threatening to end a four-week winning streak. The key level to watch is 147.50, which has now been taken out. A break below here has already sparked a wave of stop-loss selling, with the first objective of 147.00 now being met. Should rates now hold below 147.50, then this could potentially open the path towards 146.30, 146.00 and possibly 145.00 in the near-term. Meanwhile, immediate resistance is now seen at 147.50, then above that it is layered between 148.50-148.65, followed by the big psychological 150.00. *** InvestingPro provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help investors make informed decisions in any market environment.

Greater Manchester resident scoops Premium Bonds top prize of £1million in October draw - Manchester Evening News,"One saver from Greater Manchester has scooped the Premium Bond top prize of £1,000,000 this month as the October winners have been announced today. On the first of each month, National Savings and Investments (NS&I) reveals all the top prizes won by people with Premium Bonds accounts, and in October, one of the two £1m prizes has been won by a Greater Manchester resident. NS&I is a government-owned savings bank, formerly called the Post Office Savings Bank and National Savings. Back in August, the NS&I announced that its prize fund rate was set to reduce by 0.2% (3.8% to 3.6%), just a few months after going from 4% to 3.8% in April. Despite the prize fund rate reducing, the NS&I confirmed that the same number of prizes would be won by Premium Bond account holders, only the amounts won will be reduced. Statistically speaking, the higher the amount of bonds a person holds, the higher their chances of winning big - but this wasn't the case this month. The Greater Manchester saver who scooped one of the two £1m prizes held £34,450 in their Premium Bond account, and won with bond number 524KB804512. Making the winner even more lucky is the fact that the winning bond was only bought less than three years ago, in January 2023. The second winner of the £1m Premium Bond prize was a saver from Scotland who held just £10,150 in their account. They won with bond number 498FZ511907 which was bought in April 2022. The second prize level, £100,000, was won by 78 people in October, including two from Greater Manchester. Next in the prize tier is the £50,000 prize which was won by 123 Premium Bond holders, including four savers from Greater Manchester. Below £50,000, there are prizes of £25,000, £10,000, and £5,000. Some other savers defeating the statistical odds of winning big includes a saver from Scotland who had just £7 worth of Premium Bonds in their account yet managed to scoop the third top prize of £50,000. Another £50k winner from Bromley had just £50 worth of Premium Bonds in their account. There is also currently a large amount Premium Bond prizes that remains unclaimed. As of June 2025, more than 2.5 million Premium Bond prizes worth more than £103 million remain unclaimed. People with money saved in an NS&I Premium Bond account will be able to check if they have won from Thursday, October 2.",Manchester Evening News,2025-10-01T10:07:45Z,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/greater-manchester-resident-scoops-premium-32586910,2025-10-01 18:30:07.986992,0.6784313725490196

US DoE restructures deal with Lithium Americas for critical minerals,"The US Department of Energy (DoE) has restructured its deal with Lithium Americas Corporation (LAC) to take a 5% equity stake in the company and a separate 5% stake in the company's Thacker Pass lithium project joint venture (JV) with General Motors. This move is part of US efforts to help counter China's control of the lithium market. The 5% equity ownership comes in the form of LAC warrants and a 5% ownership in the form of warrants in the JV. The restructuring of the deal was carried out by the Loan Programs Office (LPO). The LPO incorporates warrants into the overall collateral package for a loan, which helps mitigate repayment risks for taxpayers. The DoE collaborated with both parties to enhance the loan's resilience. The updated agreement features strong loan modifications and includes more than $100m (C$139.28m) in new equity, stated the DoE. The government's stake in the Nevada project is part of US President Donald Trump's agenda to secure access to what is claimed to be the largest confirmed lithium deposit in North America. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said: ""Despite having some of the largest deposits, the United States produces less than 1% of the global supply of lithium. Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American lithium production is going to skyrocket. ""Today's announcement helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars. President Trump promised to do both and he is delivering."" The financial loan agreement was initially signed between the LPO and Lithium Americas in October 2024. The updated terms of the agreement will provide funding for the construction of facilities dedicated to producing lithium carbonate at Thacker Pass. Upon reaching full operational capacity, the facility is projected to produce around 40,000 tonnes per year (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. This production will support the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries and contribute to the Trump administration's goal of strengthening US supply chains by onshoring production.",Mining Technology,2025-10-01T10:12:51Z,https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-doe-restructures-deal-with-lithium-americas-for-critical-minerals/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.988002,0.3568627450980393

The big comeback of deals on Wall Street,"At the beginning of the year, M&A activity seemed somewhat frozen. This was due to the uncertainties generated by Donald Trump. In particular, the issue of tariffs was prompting companies to postpone such transactions. Ultimately, trade agreements were concluded over the summer, partially lifting this uncertainty. Above all, the market has moved on a bit. This is because the US economy remains resilient and investors are betting on artificial intelligence, which is driving indices to new peaks. And now, the Fed is starting to cut rates again, with its first cut in September and several more expected in the coming quarters by the market. This environment of monetary easing is favorable to investment banking activities. According to Bloomberg data, transaction volumes over the last three months have reached almost $1.6 trillion. Q3 2025 is thus the most prolific since the Q4 2021. Number of deals (green) and volumes per quarter. Source: Bloomberg There were 14 transactions worth over $10bn over the quarter. Examples include Union Pacific's $85bn acquisition of Norfolk Southern and Palo Alto's $25bn acquisition of CyberArk. With this rebound, 2025 is expected to be the best year since 2021. In the first nine months of the year, investment banks generated $95.4bn, according to LSEG, the second-highest total since data collection began. This week has also been marked by a new mega deal. EA Sports has been bought for $55bn by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Affinity Partners -- Jared Kushner's fund -- and private equity firm Silver Lake. The $55bn deal makes it the largest LBO in history. Prior to this, the largest transaction was the $45bn acquisition of Texas electricity provider TXU Energy in 2007 by KKR and TPG. Never heard of this company? That's not surprising, since it went bankrupt in 2014. This is not to say that EA Sports will suffer the same fate. But we can question the current situation. Between record-breaking stock prices, record valuations, and now a possible boom in deals, there is a sense of exuberance in the air. And the Fed's rate cuts are likely to boost the market even further. A sign of this frenzy is the return of SPACs, shell companies used to raise money to buy a business at a later date. Since the beginning of the year, more than 90 SPACs have raised approximately $20bn, the highest total since 2021, according to SPACInsider data. SPACs had their moment in the spotlight in 2021, at the peak of central bank accommodation and ""free money."" It was an excellent year for risky assets. The S&P 500 gained 27% in 2021. But the index then lost 20% in 2022, amid rising Fed rates, which were themselves responding to a return of inflation.",Market Screener,2025-10-01T10:11:33Z,https://www.marketscreener.com/news/the-big-comeback-of-deals-on-wall-street-ce7d5bd9db81f126,2025-10-01 18:30:07.988340,-0.003921568627450966
"Apple, Google, Meta must face lawsuits over casino-style gambling apps","A federal judge on Tuesday denied Apple, Google, and Meta Platforms' requests to dismiss lawsuits claiming they promoted illegal gambling by hosting and accepting commissions from casino-style apps that addict users. US District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, rejected the companies' main argument that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability over third-party content, shielded them from the proposed class actions. : Apple, Google, Meta targeted in EU's Digital Markets Act probes Davila dismissed some claims alleging violations of some US state laws, but denied motions to dismiss all claims brought under consumer protection laws except in California. Google, a unit of Alphabet, had no immediate comment. Apple and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Dozens of plaintiffs contended that Apple's App Store, Google's Play Store and Meta's Facebook promoted an ""authentic Vegas-style experience of slot machine gambling"" through an illegal racketeering conspiracy. ALSO READ: Apple, Meta hit by €700 million in EU fines after Trump threats By exploiting users, the defendants allegedly triggered depression, suicidal thoughts and other consequences, while brokering and collecting 30 percent commissions - estimated at more than $2 billion - on transactions they processed, the plaintiffs added. The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory and triple damages, among other remedies. Justification for immediate appeals In a 37-page decision, Davila found that Apple, Google and Meta did not act as ""publishers"" when processing payments, undercutting their Section 230 immunity claims. He called it irrelevant that the companies provided ""neutral tools"" to support the apps, and rejected a suggestion that the plaintiffs' failure to label them ""bookies"" excused them from liability. ""The crux of plaintiffs' theory is that defendants improperly processed payments for social casino apps,"" Davila wrote. ""It is beside the point whether that activity turns defendants into bookies or brokers."" : Google seeks to avoid ad tech breakup as antitrust trial begins Davila said Apple, Google and Meta may immediately appeal his decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in part because of the importance of the Section 230 issues. That court dismissed earlier appeals in May 2024, saying it lacked jurisdiction at the time.

Chunghwa Post resumes some small parcel services to U.S. - Focus Taiwan,"To activate the text-to-speech service, please first agree to the privacy policy below. Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA) Taiwan's Chunghwa Post on Wednesday said it had resumed the shipment to the United States of small parcels containing noncommercial gifts or books valued at under US$100, after suspending such shipments in late August due to the expiration of a tariff exemption. In a news release, the state-owned postal company said it had resumed such shipments in accordance with U.S. government executive orders and guidance from the Universal Postal Union's International Bureau, which confirmed such shipments remained exempt from U.S. customs duties. However, parcels that U.S. customs officers judge to be valued at over US$100 or contain items other than noncommercial gifts or books could be seized, destroyed or returned, Chunghwa Post said, adding that it would not bear responsibility for such parcels or associated costs. The resumption of service comes after Chunghwa Post halted shipments to the U.S. of all EMS (express mail service) packages, international parcel posts, ePackets, international registered small packages, and international ordinary small packages on Aug. 26. The suspension was initiated in response to the U.S. government's announcement that the so-called ""Duty-Free de minimis Treatment"" would expire on Aug. 29. The policy originally exempted customs duties on items mailed to the U.S. valued at US$800 or below. Due to its lack of a system for collecting duties from senders of parcels in advance and remitting them to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Chunghwa Post said at the time, it decided to suspend small parcel shipments to the U.S., though it continued handling letters, postcards and other printed materials. In 2024, customers sent approximately 340,000 packages to the United States via Chunghwa Post, according to the company's statistics.",Focus Taiwan (CNA English News),2025-10-01T10:15:11Z,https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202510010021,2025-10-01 18:30:07.988890,0.1764705882352942

UK manufacturing activity shrinks at fastest pace for five months,"Activity in the UK manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace for five months in September after orders dropped, according to new figures. The downturn came as firms linked to the car industry also warned that their supply chains were affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 46.2 for the month, decreasing from 47.0 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting. It was in line with economist expectations for the month. The survey showed a reduction in both domestic demand and export orders for the month as companies highlighted ""challenging"" market sentiment. Manufacturers said they scaled back production as a result, marking the 11th consecutive month of declining production. Worsening market conditions were also linked to weaker client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and higher costs. Employment in the sector also slumped again, with companies reporting that they reduced headcount to offset higher costs following increases to the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. ""Manufacturers are facing an increasingly challenging environment, with intakes of new business and levels of production hit by weak market sentiment, a dearth of new export work and a high-cost environment exacerbated by tax and labour cost rises. ""Companies entwined into the autos supply chain are also facing a temporary hit to activity following the cyber-attack on JLR."" Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The weakness in September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) may be exaggerated by businesses' concerns over tax rises at the upcoming Autumn Budget and temporary factory closures in the automotive sector. ""However, the sector certainly faces weak domestic and external demand as it navigates slowing real income growth, tightening fiscal policy, and a global economy that is still getting to grips with higher US tariffs.""",Yahoo!

Why do big oil companies invest in green energy?,"Some major oil companies such as Shell and BP that once were touted as leading the way in clean energy investments are now pulling back from those projects to refocus on oil and gas production. Others, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have concentrated on oil and gas but announced recent investments in carbon capture projects, as well as in lithium and graphite production for electric vehicle batteries. National oil companies have also been investing in renewable energy. For example, Saudi Aramco has invested in clean energy while at the same time asserting that it's unrealistic to phase out oil and gas entirely. But the larger question is why oil companies would invest in clean energy at all, especially at a time when many federal clean energy incentives are being eliminated and climate science is being dismantled, at least in the United States. Some answers depend on whom you ask. More traditional petroleum industry followers would urge the companies to keep focused on their core fossil fuel businesses to meet growing energy demand and corresponding near-term shareholder returns. Other shareholders and stakeholders concerned about sustainability and the climate - including an increasing number of companies with sustainability goals - would likely point out the business opportunities for clean energy to meet global needs. Other answers depend on the particular company itself. Very small producers have different business plans than very large private and public companies. Geography and regional policies can also play a key role. And government-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corp. control the majority of the world's oil and gas resources with revenues that support their national economies. Despite the relatively modest scale of investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies so far, there are several business reasons oil companies would increase their investments in clean energy over time. The oil and gas industry has provided energy that has helped create much of modern society and technology, though those advances have also come with significant environmental and social costs. My own experience in the oil industry gave me insight into how at least some of these companies try to reconcile this tension and to make strategic portfolio decisions regarding what ""green"" technologies to invest in. Now the managing director and a professor of the practice at the Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business at Georgia Tech, I seek ways to eliminate the boundaries and identify mutually reinforcing innovations among business interests and environmental concerns. Just like financial advisers tell you to diversify your 401(k) investments, companies do so to weather different kinds of volatility, from commodity prices to political instability. Oil and gas markets are notoriously cyclical, so investments in clean energy can hedge against these shifts for companies and investors alike. Clean energy can also provide opportunities for new revenue. Many customers want to buy clean energy, and oil companies want to be positioned to cash in as this transition occurs. By developing employees' expertise and investing in emerging technologies, they can be ready for commercial opportunities in biofuels, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and other pathways that may overlap with their existing, core business competencies. Fossil fuel companies have also found what other companies have: Clean energy can reduce costs. Some oil companies not only invest in energy efficiency for their buildings but use solar or wind to power their wells. And adding renewable energy to their activities can also lower the cost of investing in these companies. All companies, including those in oil and gas, are under growing pressure to address climate change, from the public, from other companies with whom they do business and from government regulators - at least outside the U.S. For example, campaigns seeking to reduce investment in fossil fuels are increasing along with climate-related lawsuits. Government policies focused on both mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing energy independence are also making headway in some locations. In response, many oil companies are reducing their own operational emissions and setting targets to offset or eliminate emissions from products that they sell - though many observers question the viability of these commitments. Other companies are investing in emerging technologies such as hydrogen and methods to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Some companies, such as BP and Equinor, have previously even gone so far as rebranding themselves and acquiring clean energy businesses. But those efforts have also been criticized as ""greenwashing,"" taking actions for public relations value rather than real results. It is even possible for a fossil fuel company to reinvent itself as a clean energy operation. Denmark's Orsted - formerly known as Danish Oil and Natural Gas - transitioned from fossil fuels to become a global leader in offshore wind. The company, whose majority owner is the Danish government, made the shift, however, with the help of significant public and political support. But most large oil companies aren't likely to completely reinvent themselves anytime soon. Making that change requires leadership, investor pressure, customer demand and shifts in government policy, such as putting a price or tax on carbon emissions. To show students in my sustainability classes how companies' choices affect both the environment and the industry as a whole, I use the MIT Fishbanks simulation. Students run fictional fishing companies competing for profit. Even when they know the fish population is finite, they overfish, leading to the collapse of the fishery and its businesses. Short-term profits cause long-term disaster for the fishery and the businesses that depend on it. The metaphor for oil and gas is clear: As fossil fuels continue to be extracted and burned, they release planet-warming emissions, harming the planet as a whole. They also pose substantial business risks to the oil and gas industry itself. Yet students in a recent class showed me that a more collective way of thinking may be possible. Teams voluntarily reduced their fishing levels to preserve long-term business and environmental sustainability, and they even cooperated with their competitors. They did so without in-game regulatory threats, shareholder or customer complaints, or lawsuits. Their shared understanding that the future of their own fishing companies was at stake makes me hopeful that this type of leadership may take hold in real companies and the energy system as a whole. But the question remains about how fast that change can happen, amid the accelerating global demand for more energy along with the increasing urgency and severity of climate change and its effects.",InvestMacro,2025-09-30T13:14:55Z,https://investmacro.com/2025/10/why-do-big-oil-companies-invest-in-green-energy/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.989751,0.411764705882353
New Zealand forest exports face financial impact as U.S. sets 10 pct import tariff,"WELLINGTON, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has imposed a 10 percent tariff on most softwood lumber and timber imports from New Zealand, a move expected to hit the country's forestry and wood-processing sectors, industry groups warned Wednesday. The new duty will erode competitiveness, squeeze margins and raise costs for American consumers, industry peak bodies said. ""These new tariffs are disruptive for New Zealand's forest sector at a time when confidence is vital,"" said New Zealand Forest Owners Association (NZFOA) chief executive Elizabeth Heeg. The tariff creates immediate challenges for both forest growers and wood processors, Heeg said, adding the industry would actively seek to diversify and expand into new markets. ""They add uncertainty and risk for exporters who are working hard to build long-term, sustainable supply chains benefiting both countries,"" she said. The tariff, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump following a Section 232 investigation into national security impacts of timber imports, will take effect on Oct. 14. Washington had considered duties as high as 50 percent before settling at 10 percent. New Zealand exported about 370 million NZ dollars (215 million U.S. dollars) worth of radiata pine products to the United States in 2024, making it the third-largest export market for value-added forest products, according to the NZFOA. New Zealand Wood Processors and Manufacturers Association chief executive Mark Ross said the additional costs may be absorbed by exporters or passed on to U.S. buyers. ■",english.news.cn,2025-10-01T10:14:20Z,https://english.news.cn/20251001/4b4579cf659c46feb35f2e45e6588dc9/c.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.989890,0.1529411764705881
Independence Anniversary: We must recognise and celebrate Nigeria's progress - Tinubu,"""In 65 years since our Independence, we have made tremendous progress in economic growth, social cohesion, and physical development."" President Bola Tinubu on Wednesday called on Nigerians to recognise and celebrate the country's progress since independence in 1960, even as he acknowledged the difficulties confronting the nation. In a nationwide broadcast to mark Nigeria's 65th Independence Anniversary, the Nigerian leader said the country had made remarkable strides in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and other critical sectors. ""In 65 years since our Independence, we have made tremendous progress in economic growth, social cohesion, and physical development. Our economy has experienced significant growth since 1960,"" the president said. Mr Tinubu highlighted Nigeria's growth in education, noting that while the country had only 120 secondary schools with about 130,000 students in 1960, there are now more than 23,000 secondary schools. ""At Independence, we had only the University of Ibadan and Yaba College of Technology as the two tertiary institutions in Nigeria. By the end of last year, there were 274 universities, 183 Polytechnics, and 236 Colleges of Education in Nigeria, comprising Federal, State, and private institutions."" Mr Tinubu said similar progress had been recorded in other sectors, including healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, aviation, and defence. He, however, recalled that Nigeria's 65-year journey has been marked by turbulence, including a civil war, years of military dictatorship, and political crises. ""In all these, we weathered every storm and overcame every challenge with courage, grit, and uncommon determination,"" he said. The president, delivering his third independence address since assuming office in May 2023, said his administration inherited ""a near-collapsed economy"" distorted by years of policy misalignment. He defended the government's decision to end fuel subsidies and unify the foreign exchange rates, describing the measures as tough but necessary reforms. ""We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit,"" Mr Tinubu said. According to him, funds previously wasted on subsidies are now being redirected to education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and infrastructure, including roads, power, broadband, and social investments. He urged Nigerians to support his administration's reforms, saying they are crucial to addressing the nation's infrastructure deficit. ""We are racing against time,"" he said. ""We must build the roads we need, repair the ones that have become decrepit, and construct the schools our children will attend and the hospitals that will care for our people. We have to plan for the generations that will come after us."" Today marks the 65th anniversary of our great nation's Independence. As we reflect on the significance of this day and our journey of nationhood since October 1, 1960, when our founding fathers accepted the instruments of self-government from colonial rule, let us remember their sacrifice, devotion, and grand dream of a strong, prosperous, and united Nigeria that will lead Africa and be the beacon of light to the rest of the world. 2. Our founding heroes and heroines -- Herbert Macaulay, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Margaret Ekpo, Anthony Enahoro, Ladoke Akintola, Michael Okpara, Aminu Kano, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, and other nationalists -- believed it was Nigeria's manifest destiny to lead the entire black race as the largest black nation on earth. 3. For decades, the promise of our Independence has been tested by profound social, economic, and political challenges, and we have survived. While we may not have achieved all the lofty dreams of our forebearers, we have not strayed too far from them. In 65 years since our Independence, we have made tremendous progress in economic growth, social cohesion, and physical development. Our economy has experienced significant growth since 1960. 4. Although, it is much easier for those whose vocation is to focus solely on what ought to be, we must recognise and celebrate our significant progress. Nigerians today have access to better education and healthcare than in 1960. At Independence, Nigeria had 120 secondary schools with a student population of about 130,000. Available data indicate that, as of year 2024, there were more than 23,000 secondary schools in our country. At Independence, we had only the University of Ibadan and Yaba College of Technology as the two tertiary institutions in Nigeria. By the end of last year, there were 274 universities, 183 Polytechnics, and 236 Colleges of Education in Nigeria, comprising Federal, State, and private institutions. We have experienced a significant surge in growth across every sector of our national life since Independence - in healthcare, infrastructure, financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, information technology, aviation and defence, among others. 5. Our country has experienced both the good and the bad times in its 65 years of nationhood, as is normal for every nation and its people. We fought a bitter and avoidable civil war, experienced military dictatorships, and lived through major political crises. In all these, we weathered every storm and overcame every challenge with courage, grit, and uncommon determination. While our system and ties that bind us are sometimes stretched by insidious forces opposed to our values and ways of life, we continue to strive to build a more perfect union where every Nigerian can find better accommodation and find purpose and fulfilment. 6. Fellow Compatriots, this is the third time I will address you on our independence anniversary since I assumed office as your President on May 29, 2023. In the last 28 months of my administration, like our founding fathers and leaders who came before me, I have committed myself irrevocably to the unfinished nation-building business. 7. Upon assuming office, our administration inherited a near-collapsed economy caused by decades of fiscal policy distortions and misalignment that had impaired real growth. As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform. We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit. 8. In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our Commonwealth. Our administration has redirected the economy towards a more inclusive path, channelling money to fund education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and critical economic infrastructure, such as roads, power, broadband, and social investment programmes. These initiatives will generally improve Nigerians' quality of life. As a result of the tough decisions we made, the Federal and State governments, including Local Governments, now have more resources to take care of the people at the lower level of the ladder, to address our development challenges. 9. Fellow Nigerians, we are racing against time. We must build the roads we need, repair the ones that have become decrepit, and construct the schools our children will attend and the hospitals that will care for our people. We have to plan for the generations that will come after us. We do not have enough electricity to power our industries and homes today, or the resources to repair our deteriorating roads, build seaports, railroads, and international airports comparable to the best in the world, because we failed to make the necessary investments decades ago. Our administration is setting things right. 10. I am pleased to report that we have finally turned the corner. The worst is over, I say. Yesterday's pains are giving way to relief. I salute your endurance, support, and understanding. I will continue to work for you and justify the confidence you reposed in me to steer the ship of our nation to a safe harbour. 11. Under our leadership, our economy is recovering fast, and the reforms we started over two years ago are delivering tangible results. The second quarter 2025 Gross Domestic Product grew by 4.23% -- Nigeria's fastest pace in four years -- and outpaced the 3.4 per cent projected by the International Monetary Fund. Inflation declined to 20.12% in August 2025, the lowest level in three years. The administration is working diligently to boost agricultural production and ensure food security, reducing food costs. 12. In the last two years of our administration, we have achieved 12 remarkable economic milestones as a result of the implementation of our sound fiscal and monetary policies: i. We have attained a record-breaking increase in non-oil revenue, achieving the 2025 target by August with over N20 trillion. In September 2025 alone, we raised N3.65 trillion, 411% higher than the amount raised in May 2023. ii. We have restored Fiscal Health: Our debt service-to-revenue ratio has been significantly reduced from 97% to below 50%. We have paid down the infamous ""Ways and Means"" advances that threatened our economic stability and triggered inflation. Following the removal of the corrupt petroleum subsidy, we have freed up trillions of Naira for targeted investment in the real economy and social programmes for the most vulnerable, as well as all tiers of government. iii. We have a stronger foreign Reserve position than three years ago. Our external reserves increased to $42.03 billion this September -- the highest since 2019. iv. Our tax-to-GDP ratio has risen to 13.5 per cent from less than 10 per cent. The ratio is expected to increase further when the new tax law takes effect in January. The tax law is not about increasing the burden on existing taxpayers but about expanding the base to build the Nigeria we deserve and providing tax relief to low-income earners. v. We are now a Net Exporter: Nigeria has recorded a trade surplus for five consecutive quarters. We are now selling more to the world than we are buying, a fundamental shift that strengthens our currency and creates jobs at home. Nigeria's trade surplus increased by 44.3% in Q2 2025 to ₦7.46 trillion ($4.74 billion), the largest in about three years. Goods manufactured in Nigeria and exported jumped by 173%. Non-oil exports, as a component of our export trade, now represent 48 per cent, compared to oil exports, which account for 52 per cent. This signals that we are diversifying our economy and foreign exchange sources outside oil and gas. vi. Oil production rebounded to 1.68 million barrels per day from barely one million in May 2023. The increase occurred due to improved security, new investments, and better stakeholder management in the Niger Delta. Furthermore, the country has made notable advancements by refining PMS domestically for the first time in four decades. It has also established itself as the continent's leading exporter of aviation fuel. vii. The Naira has stabilised from the turbulence and volatility witnessed in 2023 and 2024. The gap between the official rate and the unofficial market has reduced substantially, following FX reforms and fresh capital and remittance inflows. The multiple exchange rates, which fostered corruption and arbitrage, are now part of history. Additionally, our currency rate against the dollar is no longer determined by fluctuations in crude oil prices. viii. Under the social investment programme to support poor households and vulnerable Nigerians, N330 billion has been disbursed to eight million households, many of whom have received either one or two out of the three tranches of the N25,000 each. ix. Coal mining recovered dramatically from a 22% decline in Q1 to 57.5% growth in Q2, becoming one of Nigeria's fastest-growing sectors. The solid mineral sector is now pivotal in our economy, encouraging value-added production of minerals extracted from our soil. x. The administration is expanding transport infrastructure across the country, covering rail, roads, airports, and seaports. Rail and water transport grew by over 40% and 27%, respectively. The 284-kilometre Kano-Kastina-Maradi Standard Gauge rail project and the Kaduna-Kano rail line are nearing completion. Work is progressing well on the legacy Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and Sokoto-Badagry Highway. The Federal Executive Council recently approved $3 billion to complete the Eastern Rail Project. xi. The world is taking notice of our efforts. Sovereign credit rating agencies have upgraded their outlook for Nigeria, recognising our improved economic fundamentals. Our stock market is experiencing an unprecedented boom, rising from an all-share index of 55,000 points in May 2003 to 142,000 points as of September 26, 2025. xii. At its last MPC meeting, the Central Bank slashed interest rates for the first time in five years, expressing confidence in our country's macroeconomic stability. 13. We are working diligently to enhance national security, ensuring our economy experiences improved growth and performance. The officers and men of our armed forces and other security agencies are working tirelessly and making significant sacrifices to keep us safe. They are winning the war against terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes. We see their victories in their blood and sweat to stamp out Boko Haram Terror in North-East, IPOB/ESN terror in South East and banditry and kidnapping. We must continue to celebrate their gallantry and salute their courage on behalf of a grateful nation. Peace has returned to hundreds of our liberated communities in North-West and North-East, and thousands of our people have returned safely to their homes. 14. I have a message for our young people. You are the future and the greatest assets of this blessed country. You must continue to dream big, innovate, and conquer more territories in your various fields of science, technology, sports, and the art and creative sector. Our administration, through policies and funding, will continue to give you wings to fly sky-high. We created NELFUND to support students with loans for their educational pursuits. Approximately 510,000 students across 36 states and the FCT have benefited from this initiative, covering 228 higher institutions. As of September 10, the total loan disbursed was N99.5 billion, while the upkeep allowance stood at N44.7 billion. 15. Credicorp, another initiative of our administration, has granted 153,000 Nigerians N30 billion affordable loans for vehicles, solar energy, home upgrades, digital devices, and more. 16. YouthCred, which I promised last June, is a reality, with tens of thousands of NYSC members now active beneficiaries of consumer credit for resettlement. 17. Under our Renewed Hope Agenda, we promised to build a Nigeria where every young person, regardless of background, has an equitable opportunity to access a better future -- thus, the Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises (iDICE) programme. The Bank of Industry is driving the programme, in collaboration with the African Development Bank, the French Development Agency, and the Islamic Development Bank. This initiative is at the cusp of implementation. Over the last two years, we have collaborated with our partners to launch the programme, supporting our young builders and dreamers in the technology and creative sectors. 18. Fellow Nigerians, I have always candidly acknowledged that these reforms have come with some temporary pains. The biting effects of inflation and the rising cost of living remain a significant concern to our government. However, the alternative of allowing our country to descend into economic chaos or bankruptcy was not an option. Our macro-economic progress has proven that our sacrifices have not been in vain. Together, we are laying a new foundation cast in concrete, not on quicksand. 19. The accurate measure of our success will not be limited to economic statistics alone, but rather in the food on our families' tables, the quality of education our children receive, the electricity in our homes, and the security in our communities. Let me assure you of our administration's determination to ensure that the resources we have saved and the stability we have built are channelled into these critical areas. Today, the governors at the state level, and the local government autonomy are yielding more developments. 20. Therefore, on this 65th Anniversary of Our Independence, my message is hope and a call to action. The federal government will continue to do its part to fix the plumbing in our economy. Now, we must all turn on the taps of productivity, innovation, and enterprise, just like the Ministry of Interior has done with our travel passports, by quickening the processing. In this regard, I urge the sub-national entities to join us in nation-building. Let us be a nation of producers, not just consumers. Let us farm our land and build factories to process our produce. Let us patronise 'Made-in-Nigeria' goods. I say Nigeria first. Let us pay our taxes. 21. Finally, let all hands be on deck. Let us believe, once more, in the boundless potential of our great nation. 22. With Almighty God on our side, I can assure you that the dawn of a new, prosperous, self-reliant Nigeria is here. 23. Happy 65th Independence Anniversary, and may God continue to bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",Premium Times Nigeria,2025-10-01T10:11:54Z,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/825093-independence-anniversary-we-must-recognise-and-celebrate-nigerias-progress-tinubu-2.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.991344,0.3647058823529412

RBI announces host of measures to improve flow of Bank credit,"To improve flow of credit, the RBI announced a host of measures, including plans to provide an enabling framework for banks to finance acquisitions by Indian corporates and enhance the limit for lending by banks against shares. Besides, the limit for lending by banks against units of REITs (real estate investment trusts), units of InvITs (infrastructure investment trusts) will also be enhanced while removing the regulatory ceiling altogether on lending against listed debt securities. Additionally, RBI will put in place a more principle-based framework for lending to capital market intermediaries. The aforementioned measures are being considered in a bid to rationalise the extant guidelines and broaden the scope for capital market lending by banks and other regulated entities. These moves come in the backdrop of reduction in the flow of non-food bank credit to the commercial sector in FY25 and the flow of credit from non-bank sources going up. Bank credit grew at 12.1 per cent during 2024-25. While it is slower than the growth rate of 16.3 per cent in 2023-24, it is higher than the average growth rate of 10.3 per cent recorded in the ten-year period preceding 2024-25, per the Governor's statement. Moreover, while the flow of non-food bank credit during the financial year 2024-25 reduced by about ₹3.4 lakh crore from ₹21.4 lakh crore to almost ₹18 lakh crore, the flow from non-bank sources more than made up for this decrease. ""Thus, even though growth rate of bank credit slowed last year, the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector increased from ₹33.9 lakh crore in 2023-24 to ₹34.8 lakh crore in 2024-25. This trend continues during the current financial year as well,"" Malhotra said.

USD/JPY: Technical Breakdown at 147.50 Signals Start of Potential Bearish Trend | Investing.com,"Looking for actionable trade ideas to navigate the current market volatility? here to unlock access to InvestingPro's AI-selected stock winners. The US dollar index has come under pressure this week, with USD/JPY emerging as one of the strongest performers across FX market. The latest leg lower in US dollar has been fuelled in part by falling US bond yields, while a slide in oil prices, which tends to benefit energy importers like Japan, has also helped to support the yen. But more to the point, it is the US government shutdown which is keeping the US dollar under pressure across the board. Markets are now weighing up the prospect of an extended stalemate, which could sap consumer confidence and deepen concerns over job security. The US dollar index has been edging lower in recent days, with traders keeping one eye on the budget standoff in Washington. Overnight, the greenback took another knock, slipping in the wake of Washington's failure to avert a government shutdown. Truth be told, this was mostly expected, but the fact that it has happened means there would be a delay for the release of critical jobs data this week, leaving the Fed flying blind on the labour market. Consequently, any near-term US dollar recovery attempts could fade. Rate expectations have already shifted. Traders are pricing around two rate cuts by year-end and over 100 basis points by 2026. This is still slightly less than what markets expected earlier this month. That repricing reflects a tug-of-war between an improving near-term US data pulse and lingering doubts over labour market strength. This means that the risks are tilted to further downside for the US dollar in the event of data disappointment this week. Yesterday, the focus was on the JOLTS job openings data, with expectations for little change. However, it showed a bit of improvement to 7.23m from 7.18m the month before. Nonetheless, the US dollar fell further, possibly because of shutdown fears and the fact that the day's other data releases were soft. Indeed, the Conference Board's consumer confidence figures, which were seen ticking lower, were confirmed, but the drop was bigger than expected at 94.2 vs. 96.0 eyed and 97.8 previous. On top of this, the Chicago PMI disappointed at 40.6 vs. 43.3 expected, and down from 41.5 previously. The Japanese yen appears to be the primary beneficiary of the latest government shutdown, which officially began overnight, and hopes of a quick resolution appear slim. The USD/JPY has dropped to 147.00 handle. Democrats appear to be bracing for a longer fight, positioning themselves as defenders of healthcare ahead of next year's mid-terms, while Republicans, with control of the congressional agenda and the backing of the White House, show little appetite to compromise. The main concern here is that with an already-weakening consumer confidence and a gloomier jobs outlook, the shutdown could exacerbate these trends if it lasts more than just a few days. If President Trump follows through on threats to dismiss non-essential staff, then as many as 150,000 layoffs could distort upcoming payroll data, with October's NFP in particular at risk. In the meantime, regular economic reporting will also be disrupted. While the US dollar struggles, the yen is quietly gaining across the board. The GBP/JPY, for example, has slipped to 198.00 after failing to hold the psychological 200.00 level and amid budget uncertainty in the UK, while the CAD/JPY is under pressure as oil prices extend their slide since the start of the week. What's more, the Bank of Japan has signalled it is edging towards tightening, while the Fed is moving in the opposite direction with cuts already in play. That means bond yield differential could narrow further in favor of the yen, potentially creating a bearish USD/JPY trend. From a technical perspective, the USD/JPY chart is starting to show a few bearish signs again after being neutral for much of the summer. The pair has been choppy for months -- flat in June, higher in July, lower in August, and then bouncing in early September. In the last few days, however, sellers have regained the upper hand, threatening to end a four-week winning streak. The key level to watch is 147.50, which has now been taken out. A break below here has already sparked a wave of stop-loss selling, with the first objective of 147.00 now being met. Should rates now hold below 147.50, then this could potentially open the path towards 146.30, 146.00 and possibly 145.00 in the near-term. Meanwhile, immediate resistance is now seen at 147.50, then above that it is layered between 148.50-148.65, followed by the big psychological 150.00. *** InvestingPro provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help investors make informed decisions in any market environment.

"Dual Share Classes Are Coming Soon. Now, What?","The SEC's pending approval of dual share classes may be the biggest story of the year for ETFs, but it may nonetheless be a while before ETF share classes of mutual funds, and vice versa, become available to investors. Following the regulator's notice on Monday that it is set to greenlight Dimensional Fund Advisors' request for dual share class exemptions, the company noted that it would launch share classes as soon as it is ready. That firm is certainly well ahead of most others in that regard: It already provides a range of funds in both the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund wrappers, and it has been seeking approval for several years. But even Dimensional says there is a way to go. ""We know many investors are eager for the ability to exchange mutual fund shares for ETF shares without incurring transaction costs or taxes,"" co-CEO Gerard O'Reilly said in an announcement, adding that custodians will need to get up to speed to facilitate the new products. F/m Investments plans to initially launch mutual fund shares of its US Treasury 3 Month Bill and Ultrashort TIPS ETFs. CEO Alex Morris said it's a way for issuers to enter into the 401(k) market. ""Expect an initial wave of approvals for mature applications, followed by a gradual rollout,"" he said. Following SEC approvals, fund boards must consider whether adding share classes is appropriate for products. ETF share classes of mutual funds with capacity constraints, for example, may not be a good fit. ""It's going to be a game-changer for the industry,"" said Matt Barry, head of capital markets at Touchstone Investments. ""You're going to see a lot of those [active mutual] funds offer ETF share classes ... with strategies that are already at scale."" Touchstone, like most others, will likely be a year away from launching the new share classes, he said. That is in part due to the operational challenges that firms will have to address, especially if they specialize in one wrapper, but not the other. And another issue is ""the ETF ecosystem's ability to handle that number [of new] products,"" Barry said, citing a potential lack of lead market makers to put up capital to support ETF share classes. Some highlights of the dual share class application race: Test Drive: ""Boards have to kick the tires. The current framework contemplates substantial board oversight,"" said Aisha Hunt, principal at law firm Kelley Hunt, who worked with F/m Investments on its application. There is an educational hurdle for firms in adding ETF or mutual fund shares, and companies will have to perform due diligence with RIAs and broker-dealers to see whether there is demand, she said. ""You want to do it to ensure you can drive asset growth and economies of scale to benefit fund shareholders.""",The Daily Upside,2025-10-01T10:10:00Z,https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/regulation-legislation/dual-share-classes-are-coming-soon-now-what/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.993449,0.3803921568627451

What You Need to Know About Annuities,"A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end.",WHAS 11 Louisville,2025-10-01T10:00:39Z,https://www.whas11.com/article/syndication/associatedpress/what-you-need-to-know-about-annuities/616-0987ec48-43e7-41f9-b51a-3ef4091dbcdf,2025-10-01 18:30:07.994164,0.06666666666666665
Move Over State Street. JPMorgan Becomes Latest to File for Private Credit ETF,"Sign up for exclusive news and analysis of the rapidly evolving ETF landscape. What's private is increasingly becoming public ... or at least retail. This week, J.P. Morgan Asset Management got in line to be the next ETF issuer dabbling in private credit. The firm filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval of its Total Credit ETF, a product that would allocate up to 15% of assets to private credit. ""The US corporate credit market is increasingly converging, as issuers move fluidly between public bonds and private credit,"" said Jed Laskowitz, global head of private markets and customized solutions for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""The private credit market can add yield and diversification benefits to portfolios, and investors are increasingly interested in investing actively across the public and private credit spectrum."" The firm declined to comment on the product filing itself. With private credit funds having high yields, they are worth considering for a small slice of an investor's portfolio, said Alvin Carlos, financial planner and managing partner at District Capital Management. ""An aggressive client portfolio currently contains between 5% to 10% private credit via [business development companies] for high yield,"" he said. The downside is volatility. ""During a stock market crash, a BDC stock could drop by as much as 50%,"" he said. Semiliquid funds that are sold to nonqualified buyers reached $450 billion in assets through June, a 77% increase from 2022, according to a report last week from Morningstar. But State Street and JPMorgan aren't the only major asset managers that want in on the action: Will It ETF? The ETF filed this week would use J.P. Morgan Asset Management to underwrite primary or secondary markets investments, Bloomberg reported, citing a source familiar with the strategy. The company's filing did not include fees, though the SPDR SSGA IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) charges 0.7% and its second fund, State Street Short Duration IG Public & Private Credit ETF, which launched last month, charges 0.59%. It's early days in private credit ETFs, and those two funds represent $139 million and $25 million, respectively. That's not a verdict on the hotly anticipated category, but retail investors aren't exactly piling into private credit ETFs yet.",The Daily Upside,2025-10-01T10:05:00Z,https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/move-over-state-street-jpmorgan-becomes-latest-to-file-for-private-credit-etf/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.994386,0.3803921568627451

""With Max URB_N, our ambition has always been to be part of youth culture in its truest form,"" said Sumit Chandna, Deputy CEO, Max Fashion. ""Rap gives us that bridge: it's authentic, it's unapologetic, and it's local. With the South Tour featuring Paal Dabba, Baby Jean, and Kayden Sharma, we're not just putting on a show; we're building a stage where young India can see themselves -- loud, proud, and unmuted."" Sumit added, ""We're shaping a new cultural space where fashion and music collide. From launching an original rap anthem to collaborating with Alaya F on IYKYDK -- a Gen Z narrative -- the brand has been steadily setting a new benchmark every season. Now, by taking it to the next level with a multi-city rap tour showcasing the most authentic voices in hip hop, we are creating a cultural moment that puts URB_N at the heart of youth identity, where style and sound meet."" Arjun Ravi Kolady, Head of Sales - Spotify India, said: ""Spotify has long championed local hip-hop and emerging voices. This isn't new for us -- it's part of our DNA. Partnering with Max URB_N for the South Tour takes that commitment further, creating an intersection of sound and style that resonates deeply with Gen Z. Gabhri, MC Hari, and Vengayo embody the raw energy of the South, and this platform ensures their stories travel louder, prouder, and further than ever before."" What Max URB_N and Spotify have sparked is bigger than a tour. It's a cultural benchmark -- where style meets sound, and an entire generation refuses to stay muted.

"Tokyo stocks fall amid caution about U.S. gov't shutdown, profit-taking","TOKYO, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stocks ended lower Wednesday, amid caution about the impact of a partial shutdown of the U.S. government and investors locking in gains. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, ended 381.78 points, or 0.85 percent, from Tuesday at 44,550.85, falling for a fourth consecutive trading day. The broader Topix index, meanwhile, finished 42.86 points, or 1.37 percent, lower at 3,094.74. Stocks lacked trading incentives as investors grew cautious about a U.S. government shutdown, which would lead to delays in the release of economic data and leave the Federal Reserve with few clues to decide whether to further cut interest rates, dealers said. The market was also weighed down by investors locking in gains and unloading shares to adjust their positions at the start of the second half of the fiscal year in Japan. ■",english.news.cn,2025-10-01T10:14:20Z,https://english.news.cn/20251001/20eb7f353be7415285d3631db9059248/c.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.994759,0.09019607843137245

Regional Bank's Shares Test Key Support Level,"First Business Services shares are currently grappling with a challenge familiar to many financial stocks: directional uncertainty. The regional bank's equity continues to trade above its year-start valuation, yet recent sessions reveal clear signs of momentum fading. Market participants now question whether the stock is preparing for a sustained directional shift or merely consolidating before its next significant move. Despite the current sideways trading pattern, First Business Services maintains one compelling advantage for income-focused investors. The company provides a reliable dividend yield of 2.26 percent, offering shareholders consistent returns during periods of market ambiguity. This distribution policy reinforces the bank's position as a dependable income generator within the traditionally stable financial sector, providing a cushion against price volatility.",Ad Hoc News,2025-10-01T10:13:18Z,https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/ueberblick/regional-bank-s-shares-test-key-support-level/68240415,2025-10-01 18:30:07.995452,0.223529411764706
What You Need to Know About Annuities,"Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Recommended Videos Q: How do income annuities work, and how they are different from investing in something that pays out income like bonds? A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end. Q: How can these types of annuities help with retirement planning? A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household's basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses -- housing, taxes, healthcare -- total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That's an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it. Q: Savings annuities, or ""deferred annuities,"" allow investors to get market exposure in addition to income. What are some key savings annuity types? A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you're in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular ""fixed index"" annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. Q: These products are more complicated than income annuities, and they carry more risk and higher costs. How can investors make sure they know what they're getting into with these products? A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. Q: What are the tax implications of annuities? A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Thousands across Ireland facing up to €600 increase as health insurance prices spike,"VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health are all increasing their costs from today Thousands of people across Ireland are set to pay higher health insurance costs as the three main health insurers are increasing their premiums from this week.

Speaking on the increases, leading broker of Health Insurance Ireland, Dermot Goode, said customers should never rely on the average figures quoted above.

"Sage makes accounting, carbon reporting and AI simple for small businesses and accountants","Sage has announced enhancements to its Sage Accounting suite, adding AI, payroll, HR and carbon reporting to every plan, helping small businesses and accountants cut admin, get paid faster and meet growing sustainability requirements. Sage has made major enhancements to its Sage Accounting suite - integrating AI, payroll, HR and carbon reporting into every plan. These updates are pitched as giving small businesses and accountants practical tools to save time, stay compliant, get paid faster and meet growing sustainability demands. At the heart of the upgrade is Sage Copilot, now included in every plan. This AI-powered assistant helps small business owners and accountants cut admin, stay on top of Making Tax Digital (MTD) requirements and keep payroll running smoothly. Customers already report being paid up to seven days sooner, freeing up time to focus on growth and clients rather than spreadsheets and paperwork. ""Small businesses are the heart of our economy, but too often they've been left behind when it comes to adopting new technology,' said Neal Watkins, EVP, Small Business and Accountants at Sage. ""By putting Sage Copilot into every plan, we're giving small business owners and accountants practical, accessible, trusted AI that reduces the admin burden. From cash flow and compliance to payroll and sustainability, Sage Accounting puts AI to work where it matters most so customers can focus on growing with confidence."" Alongside AI, Sage is delivering more value with fully integrated payroll and HR, making it easier to pay staff accurately, manage leave and onboard efficiently. Sustainability is also now built in. Sage Earth Carbon Accounting, powered by AI, automatically captures and categorises data from financial transactions to generate clear insights into a company's carbon footprint. With large companies and government bodies increasingly demanding emissions data from their suppliers, this functionality helps small businesses compete in tenders, access green financing and progress on their journey to Net Zero. ""As a small business, we're increasingly being asked by larger customers to provide carbon data as part of contracts,"" said Lisa Settle, Director, Ryland Communications. ""Having Sage Earth Carbon Accounting supports our ambition to reach Net Zero, while also giving us the tools to respond to customer requests. That combination can make the difference between staying in or dropping out of a supply chain."" Helping accountants guide clients on carbon reporting Accountants are also set to benefit, with Sage for Accountants now offering carbon reporting alongside financial services. This gives firms the ability to prepare credible reports and guide clients on efficiency and sustainability, extending their role as trusted advisers. ""Carbon reporting is becoming a bigger part of the conversations we're having with clients,' said Rebecca Trudgett, Founder, Switchfoot Accounting. ""Sage Earth Carbon Accounting will allow us to deliver that advice with confidence, alongside the financial services we already provide."" These enhancements also strengthen collaboration between accountants and clients, with Sage for Accountants bringing together everything firms need to run their practice - from capturing and processing client data to managing proposals, forecasting cash flow and handling payroll services. New tools like the upcoming MTD Agent for Income Tax will further automate tax workflows, giving practices more time to focus on clients. ""Admin can eat up too much of the week, and with new clients set to need support because of MTD, we need access to the latest tech to support them,' said Andrew Smith, Director, Smith & Co, Chartered Certified Accountants. ""With Sage's latest offering and the upcoming MTD Agent for Income Tax, we're confident we'll be able to stay focused on clients where it matters most, while still growing our practice."" Building a stronger Net Zero ecosystem This launch is part of Sage's wider work to build a trusted, AI-powered ecosystem for SMBs. Beyond its own products, Sage is investing in industry initiatives such as Project Perseus to improve access to UK energy data and co-developing standards like the UK Voluntary SME Carbon Reporting Standard. It has also launched the Carbon Accounting API and partnered to establish Carbon Commons and the Carbon Accounting Alliance to promote transparent reporting. ""At Sage, we know small businesses are critical to tackling climate change, but too often they lack the tools and support to get started,"" said George Sandilands, VP, Sage Earth. ""Through Sage Earth, we're building not only practical solutions like Sage Earth Carbon Accounting, but also the standards, partnerships and infrastructure that give SMBs the confidence to take meaningful action and demonstrate progress."" With AI embedded across workflows, carbon reporting integrated alongside financial data and payroll and HR made simpler, Sage says it is redefining how small businesses and accountants work. The result: less time spent on admin, more confidence in compliance and sustainability and greater freedom to grow.",Intelligent CIO,2025-10-01T10:07:41Z,https://www.intelligentcio.com/eu/2025/10/01/sage-makes-accounting-carbon-reporting-and-ai-simple-for-small-businesses-and-accountants/,2025-10-01 18:30:07.996603,0.2941176470588236
Dangote refinery agrees to reabsorb sacked workers after government intervention,"Both parties committed to resolving the strike and ensuring smooth operations at the refinery. Dangote Refinery has agreed to reinstate and redeploy workers it recently dismissed, following negotiations with labour representatives and government officials. The decision follows reports last week of hundreds of staff being laid off at the $20 billion Dangote Petroleum Refinery in Lagos. At the time, the company said the layoffs were part of a restructuring plan to boost efficiency as the plant ramps up operations. The Ministry of Labour and Employment announced the resolution on Wednesday in a statement outlining the outcome of reconciliation talks held on Monday and Tuesday. DON'T MISS THIS: Dangote refinery signs two-year naira crude deal with Nigeria's national oil company after brief suspension On Tuesday, Aliko Dangote, founder of the Dangote Group, and representatives of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) met with Wale Edun, the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, and Mohammed Dingyadi, the Minister of Labour and Employment, to resolve the labour dispute. ""The Honourable Minister of Labour informed the meeting that unionisation is a right of workers in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and that this right should be respected,"" the ministry said. ""After examining the procedure used in the disengagement of workers, the meeting agreed that the management of Dangote Group shall immediately start the process of taking the disengaged staff to other companies within the Dangote Group, with no loss of pay."" ""No worker will be victimised arising from their role in the impasse between Dangote and PENGASSAN."" DON'T MISS THIS: Dangote's wealth rebounds to $29 billion despite domestic pressures, on cement and refinery growth PENGASSAN also agreed to begin the process of calling off its strike, with the ministry noting that both parties agreed to this understanding in good faith. Earlier, the union had directed its members to disrupt operations at the refinery by cutting off gas supply. It said the action was in response to the management's dismissal of some workers for joining the union. Dangote Refinery described the union's directive as illegal and urged PENGASSAN to comply with Nigerian laws, stressing that the association had no legal authority to disrupt or interfere with its contracts with third-party suppliers of gas and crude oil. The refinery also appealed to the federal government and security agencies to intervene, warning that PENGASSAN's actions were not only unlawful but could also inflict serious harm on the Nigerian economy and citizens.",Business Insider Africa,2025-10-01T10:14:28Z,https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/dangote-refinery-agrees-to-reabsorb-sacked-workers-after-government-intervention/rykqepj,2025-10-01 18:30:07.996921,0.2392156862745098

Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

eBay launches new AI productivity programme worth over £3m to upskill small businesses | Bristol Live,"A new programme worth over £3 million to skill-up small UK businesses with fully funded access to the latest custom AI productivity tools and training to free up time and boost growth has been launched by eBay. Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, the programme is open to all businesses which sell on eBay with up to 10,000 to be onboarded this year. With small businesses accounting for three-fifths of UK employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector, equipping them with the technology and skills to compete is critical to deliver growth. The programme will offer access to ChatGPT Enterprise for up to 12 months in addition to tailored training to help unlock its potential. Additional support will include a dedicated eBay team who will engage with sellers to develop custom GPTs which will be most beneficial to growing small businesses on eBay and beyond. There is strong appetite for using AI among UK small businesses, but also a need for assistance in applying it to achieve business impact. While 69% of online businesses feel excited (43%) or curious (26%) about AI's potential, many are still working out how to make best use of the technology for them. Broader AI adoption could deliver a step change in UK productivity, with the IMF estimating that the technology could add as much as £470 billion to GDP by 2035. eBay is the first online marketplace to provide OpenAI's tools and relevant training free to its small business customers. The training programme has been designed using insights from seller research and interviews which identified the greatest opportunities for AI to free up time and increase productivity. These include sessions on managing financial analysis, creating promotional campaigns and effective research. Training will take place virtually as well as moving to in-person sessions in 2026. Eve Williams, General Manager, eBay UK, said: ""The issue is no longer whether businesses should adopt AI. ""It is how quickly they can start before their competitors do. Those businesses and economies that don't invest in AI now risk being left behind. That's why eBay is investing to put world-class AI in the hands of small businesses and entrepreneurs, with no charge to them. ""We want British small businesses to win nationally and globally which means that the latest AI tools cannot be the preserve of big business. They should be in the hands of every small business in Britain."" Nitzan Mekel-Bobrov, Chief AI Officer, eBay, said: ""AI is reshaping ecommerce and eBay is all-in. We see this as a generational opportunity to reimagine buying and selling for our customers, powered by three decades of marketplace insights and cutting-edge models. ""With AI Activate, we're extending that vision to small businesses and making sure that they don't have to figure this out alone. Giving small businesses the same tools and advantages as big retailers means that they can innovate and grow to capitalise on the AI era."" The launch of eBay AI Activate reflects a broader focus for the company on capitalising on AI, with artificial intelligence now embedded at the heart of the business. eBay has already invested in equipping its employees with ChatGPT Enterprise globally, focusing on its use to enhance team creativity, exploration and productivity. Across the platform, more than 10 million sellers worldwide have used eBay's generative AI tools to create over 300 million listings, contributing several billion dollars of GMV, with more than 500,000 new listings generated every day. Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist at OpenAI commented: ""Small businesses power the UK economy, accounting for over 99% of the UK's firms. Yet for too long, they have not had the tools to drive increases in productivity the way larger firms do. ""This collaboration could change that. By putting world-class AI tools in the hands of 10,000 UK entrepreneurs, we're investing in the UK's economic engine. If we want to close the productivity gap, this is where to start.""",Bristol Post,2025-10-01T10:14:15Z,https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/ebay-launches-new-ai-productivity-10540644,2025-10-01 18:30:07.997545,0.4352941176470588
New Zealand forest exports face financial impact as U.S. sets 10 pct import tariff,"WELLINGTON, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has imposed a 10 percent tariff on most softwood lumber and timber imports from New Zealand, a move expected to hit the country's forestry and wood-processing sectors, industry groups warned Wednesday. The new duty will erode competitiveness, squeeze margins and raise costs for American consumers, industry peak bodies said. ""These new tariffs are disruptive for New Zealand's forest sector at a time when confidence is vital,"" said New Zealand Forest Owners Association (NZFOA) chief executive Elizabeth Heeg. The tariff creates immediate challenges for both forest growers and wood processors, Heeg said, adding the industry would actively seek to diversify and expand into new markets. ""They add uncertainty and risk for exporters who are working hard to build long-term, sustainable supply chains benefiting both countries,"" she said. The tariff, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump following a Section 232 investigation into national security impacts of timber imports, will take effect on Oct. 14. Washington had considered duties as high as 50 percent before settling at 10 percent. New Zealand exported about 370 million NZ dollars (215 million U.S. dollars) worth of radiata pine products to the United States in 2024, making it the third-largest export market for value-added forest products, according to the NZFOA. New Zealand Wood Processors and Manufacturers Association chief executive Mark Ross said the additional costs may be absorbed by exporters or passed on to U.S. buyers. ■",english.news.cn,2025-10-01T10:14:20Z,https://english.news.cn/asiapacific/20251001/810546a446c4414182a360e5ce8ae3fb/c.html,2025-10-01 18:30:07.997684,0.1529411764705881
Melania Trump's Nails Haven't Changed in 14 Years -- And There's a Powerful Reason Why - Inquisitr News,"Melania Trump during a hospital visit amid GOP Medicaid. (Cover image source: X.com/ @marideenow) Throughout two presidential elections, the First Lady's style has gained popularity as a beauty trend. Melania Trump has been referred to as the epitome of this refined style. Melania demonstrates that ageless elegance is about figuring out what works and sticking with it, even when it comes to her nails, which she has been sporting since 2011. Melania adopts a beauty regimen that is as sophisticated as it is reliable, leaving no opportunity for creativity, much like Queen Letizia with her trademark haircut. The adaptability and elegance of this manicure style are what make nude tints so popular. Melania has stuck with the milky finish for over a decade because it works in any circumstance. She preferred a simple, natural manicure with just a clear top coat before embracing this look. In her earlier years, Melania chose to keep things simple and private. Her medium-length, flawlessly formed nails were devoid of any striking hues. The only time she followed a trend was in 2007, when she wore the classic French manicure. It's a timeless style featuring a delicate white tip, medium length, and a nude base. This timeless design visually lengthens the fingers and remains in style to this day. It was merely a prelude to her now-famous milky nails, though. Melania found her ideal complement in 2011, the creamy white nails. In contrast to conventional white polish or transparent nude hues, this style strikes the perfect mix between being soft and translucent, producing a smooth, polished look. She initially wore them medium length, but as First Lady, she adopted a longer, more elegant look. Her dedication to this manicure was evident during Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States in 2017 at the Candlelight Dinner in Washington, D.C. Melania debuted a variation of her favorite nail style that evening, a cross between a French manicure and a milky white. This look became one of her most iconic beauty statements, with a slight gradient that resembled the ""baby boomer"" method. Now that Donald Trump is the president of the United States, Melania still uses her go-to manicure. Her white French nails never go out of style, whether she's attending state visits, formal galas, or sophisticated dinners. They are her go-to choice for ensuring her hands always look elegant, well-groomed, and perfectly aligned with her polished public image. Melania Trump's manicures are more than simply a beauty choice. They have become an integral part of who she is, demonstrating that sometimes the secret to classic style is knowing what works and sticking with it.",The Inquisitr,2025-10-01T10:01:14Z,https://www.inquisitr.com/melania-trumps-nails-havent-changed-in-14-years-and-theres-a-powerful-reason-why,2025-10-01 18:30:07.997900,0.3725490196078431
AIS marks 35 years with bold AI-driven vision for growth and sustainability,"This new chapter marks the company's evolution from a network operator to a ""cognitive tech company"" focused on innovation for national benefit. Celebrating its 35th anniversary on Wednesday (October 1), Thailand's leading mobile operator Advanced Info Service (AIS) unveiled a bold new chapter, pledging to drive the nation forward with artificial intelligence (AI) to power economic growth and build a sustainable society. Guided by its forward-looking digital leadership, the company has committed to harnessing the potential of AI to enhance Thailand's competitiveness, bolster the economy, and lay the foundations for a sustainable future. Somchai Lertsutiwong, Chief Executive Officer of AIS, said that for more than 35 years the company has played a pivotal role in building the foundations of Thailand's digital infrastructure, becoming a key pillar in advancing the nation's telecommunications industry to global standards. He emphasised that AIS has never confined itself to being merely a network operator, but has evolved into a full-fledged cognitive tech company, leveraging technology and innovation to enhance quality of life and empower Thai businesses. Today, AIS embarks on a new chapter with the power of AI under the concept of AI for a Sustainable Nation. Our goal is to connect every sector so we can grow together, driving the Thai economy forward with both strength and sustainability, Somchai said.",The Nation Thailand,2025-10-01T10:14:01Z,https://www.nationthailand.com/business/corporate/40056200,2025-10-01 18:30:07.998024,0.4823529411764707
Classroom dollars at risk in Hamilton's stormwater debate,"Hamilton's new stormwater fee could cost the public school board nearly $800,000 per year -- prompting calls for an exemption for local school properties from the so-called ""rain tax."" City staff told the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board liaison committee Thursday that the public board's 93 schools could see an estimated $788,000 annual bill after the contentious stormwater fee is implemented. That bill could be cut in half, to $394,000, if schools are able to apply a stormwater incentive program credit, noted Charlene McKay, the city's manager of compliance and regulations. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW But Coun. Jeff Beattie, a former public board trustee, argued in an interview that school boards are funded for very specific things -- stormwater fees not among them. He warned the board would have to find that money somewhere, potentially affecting classroom resources. As a result, the liaison committee passed a motion by Beattie asking city staff to look at the impact of providing a full exemption to both the public and Catholic school boards. ""Essentially, not taking money out of the classroom to put down the drain,"" he said. The stormwater fees, due to be introduced next year, could also have a $448,000 impact on the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board, although that estimated cost does not factor in credits or reduced sewer bills, said Clayton Pereira, the city's director of revenue services, via email. Approved in 2023, Hamilton's stormwater fee program -- derided by critics as a ""rain tax"" -- is meant to help the city respond to rising sewer repair and flooding costs linked to climate change. It gives stormwater infrastructure its own funding source, separated from sewer and water rates. Hamilton followed other municipalities in adopting the fees, including Mississauga, Ottawa and Brampton. Staff told the committee the fees are expected to be implemented in July 2026. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW McKay told the committee schools could add stormwater sustainability to their curriculum and receive a 15 per cent fee credit -- but to get a 50 per cent credit, schools would have to employ other methods, including rain gardens, bioswales or stormwater ponds. Those methods vary in cost -- with a rain garden carrying a roughly $6,000 price tag just for plants and soil -- but McKay noted the return on investment ""is quite high"" and can be seen ""every year"" in reduced stormwater fees. But at that price, installing a rain garden at each of the board's 93 schools would cost more than $500,000, said Ward 3 trustee and public board chair Maria Felix Miller. She added the installation would rely on staff and parents -- and at schools where similar gardens have been installed, those projects have taken multiple years. ""It is not necessarily feasible, and certainly not feasible overnight,"" she told the committee. McKay told the committee some municipalities with stormwater fees have provided full exemptions to school boards, but that is the exception rather than the rule. In an interview, Miller said the public board would like to receive a full exemption to the fee. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW She said while the fee to the board could theoretically be ""whittled down"" to $394,000, that is still an annual expense for which the board does not receive funding. The board does have a contingency fund, but it is meant for emergencies and not to pay an ongoing tax, Miller added. Trustee Todd White said the public board worked for a number of years to create a unique reciprocal relationship with the city that sees the board not charge the city fees to use its facilities. The stormwater fee could upset that relationship, he said. ONTARIO NOW NEWSLETTER Get our free new weekly newsletter Error! Sorry, there was an error processing your request.

Will XRP Soar? Potential Gains from October's ETF Approval,"Entering October 2025, XRP price has been trading at $2.80 to $2.90. Over late September, it pushed steadily upward from lower levels, fueled by hopes of ETF approval and general strength across the crypto sector. Analysts often reference support near $2.75 and resistance near $3.20 and $3.66. Much of the build-up appears to reflect expectations for early October developments. If a spot XRP ETF is approved, the issuer will likely need to buy large amounts of XRP to seed and maintain the fund. That creates direct demand. At the same time, XRP held on exchanges may move into institutional custody, reducing the liquid supply available to traders. The combination of rising demand and shrinking supply could push prices upward. Moreover, approval would boost sentiment, prompting more retail and derivative demand, compounding the upside effect. Historical moves in crypto ETFs (especially Bitcoin and Ethereum) suggest that new-fund adoption often triggers multi-week inflows amounting to billions of dollars. If XRP captures even a fraction of that attention, the price effect might be sizeable, especially given that much of XRP's supply is not on active exchanges. If a successful XRP ETF attracts in inflows over a period of months, the upward pressure would be meaningful. Under modest inflow scenarios, gains of 20 to 60 percent from current levels are imaginable. In more aggressive cases, if institutional money rushes in, a doubling or more is not out of the question, especially in a that favors scarcity.",Analytics Insight,2025-10-01T10:13:24Z,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/xrp/will-xrp-soar-potential-gains-from-octobers-etf-approval,2025-10-01 18:30:07.998498,0.2313725490196079
World shares are mixed as a US government shutdown adds to uncertainty - The Boston Globe,"In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.9% to 44,550.85 after the Bank of Japan reported a slight improvement in business sentiment among major manufacturers. The indications from the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey raise the odds that the central bank will increase its key interest rate to counter inflation that has topped its target range of about 2% for some time. Political uncertainty is also looming over Japan's markets, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party due to chose a new leader and prime minister later this week to replace embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Markets and offices in mainland China are closed until Oct. 8 for the National Day holiday, China's central bank said it plans a 1.1 trillion yuan ($160 billion) reverse repo operation on Oct. 9, to increase the amount of cash in circulation and stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,455.83, while Taiwan's Taiex added 0.6% on heavy buying of semiconductor-related shares. Markets appeared to be taking the US shutdown, which took effect at midnight US Eastern time, in stride. Past US government shutdowns have had a limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. This shutdown could be different, with the White House prone to push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Trump's tariffs won't derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Tuesday brought mixed reports on the US economy. A Conference Board survey showed consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ""low-hire, low-fire"" state. US employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that's neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, since a government shutdown would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday's on how many jobs US employers created and destroyed in September. The Department of Labor has said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there's a lapse. The agency already was strained by Trump's firing of Erika McEntarfer as BLS commissioner on Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed a rapid slowdown in hiring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Late Tuesday, the White House said Trump was withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the bureau, according to an AP source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a White House action that hadn't been publicly announced. Oil prices fell back early Wednesday, with US benchmark crude oil shedding 21 cents to $62.16 per barrel.

Old Farmer's Almanac Predicts Varied October 2025 Weather for US,"October 2025 US Weather Forecast Reveals Widespread Temperature Shifts.The Old Farmer's Almanac has released its long-range weather outlook for October 2025. It predicts a month of varied and shifting conditions across the United States. Unseasonable coolness will dominate many regions, punctuated by rain and brief warm spells.This forecast comes from one of North America's most trusted historical publications. The Almanac uses a proprietary formula to predict weather patterns months in advance. According to the Almanac, the Northeast will see a cool, showery start. A brief sunny period will follow in early October. Mid-month brings a return to rain before a north-south split develops, with northern areas staying wetter.The Atlantic Corridor should expect cooler-than-average temperatures overall. The region will experience a cycle of rain and sunshine throughout the month. A significant warm and rainy spell is predicted for the second week.The Southeast will begin with warm sunshine before cooling off. Showers become more frequent in the middle two weeks. The Deep South will follow a similar pattern, starting warm but facing thunderstorms and heavy rain mid-month. This forecast suggests a mixed bag for agricultural planning and outdoor activities. The widespread cooler trend may lead to an earlier onset of fall foliage in northern states. It could also extend the harvest window for some cool-weather crops.For residents, the pattern indicates a need for layered clothing. The alternation between sunshine and rain will require flexibility for autumn plans. The predicted warmth in the final days for western regions offers a pleasant end to the month.

'Sad day for the festival': Burlington city staff recommend funding cutoff for annual massive free music festival,"It's too early to say whether Burlington's Sound of Music Festival will continue, if a City of Burlington staff recommendation to end municipal funding for the event is approved by city councillors. ""We would need some new corporate partners immediately,"" said festival organizing committee chair Dave Shepherd. ""Without that, it would be very challenging to put on a festival. We would have to look at all options once we have a clear decision from the city on where they stand."" A staff report to the Monday, Oct. 6 committee of whole meeting recommends councillors decline a Sound of Music Festival (SOM) request for funding, and discontinue city financial support ""due to ongoing financial instability and noncompliance"" with funding agreements. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Any decision made by committee must be finalized at the next city council meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 14. Shepherd said last week a late summer effort to find new sponsors was unsuccessful, and new ideas were on the table. But in the report going to committee, staff suggest $150,000 designated for SOM in the 2026 operating budget be reallocated to the city's Community Investment Fund, enhancing support for a ""broader range of festivals and events across Burlington"" including opportunities to potentially support a ""new music festival and/or provider in 2026."" If approved, staff could report back to council on opportunities for a different music festival at Spencer Smith Park after seeking expressions of interest from potential organizers. ""To say we're disappointed is an understatement,"" Shepherd said. ""We were asked to provide a plan for 2026 and a wish list. So we did this in early September, hoping we would hear back from the city and have meaningful conversation."" In its business plan, festival organizers proposed a smaller scale event in 2026, with a paid entry fee of $5 per person. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""With overall budget cuts again to keep costs down again ... we wanted to show a new festival that can be break-even or profitable,"" Shepherd stated in an email. ""We told them this in our plan. The only feedback we received was letting us know that the report was released."" He said if city staff weren't happy with what festival organizers submitted ""they should have told us and we could all sit in a room and figure this out."" Organizers are now set to delegate to councillors at committee of the whole Oct. 6. ""All we were asking for was a meaningful conversation around our 2026 plans. It's disappointing,"" Shepherd said. ""It's a sad day for the festival and the thousands of people who volunteer, and the legacy of the festival."" According to the staff report, the city provided nearly $1 million in combined support to SOM between 2024 and 2025, including loans, grants, logistical support and in-kind assistance. ""During this period, (SOM) received close to 80 per cent of the City's total event support budget -- substantially more than any other festival or event in Burlington. The remaining 20% was distributed among ten other events,"" the report states. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW A grant agreement was introduced for 2025 -- requiring a festival business plan and payment of outstanding arrears. ""Although BSOM submitted a business plan, it did not meet the necessary standards for evaluation,"" staff said. ""Key financial details and strategic insights were lacking, making it difficult for the City to fully assess (SOM's) long-term viability and alignment with its investment principles."" The report states conditions of funding agreements had not been fulfilled, and the festival still owes the city approximately $245,000. In a letter to the city dated Sept. 9, SOM requests relief from a loan that is past due on Sept. 1 ($225,000 owed); relief from approximately $22,000 owed from past festivals; plus a $200,000 emergency grant in October; and a grant of $350,000 in January 2026 and every festival year going forward. Staff provide two other options for councillors to consider -- including supporting the festival's request, or transitioning festival responsibility to the city. Staff don't support either option.

Empower Personal Wealth Division Mulls RIA Acquisitions,"You can find original article here WealthManagement. to our free daily WealthManagement newsletters. Empower, the country's second-largest retirement plan provider, is eying potential RIA acquisitions as it continues to grow its personal wealth division. Empower Personal Wealth, which has about 1,000 financial advisors, has grown through organic client acquisition through offshoots of its retirement plan business, which includes roughly 19 million participants and nearly $1.8 trillion in assets under advisement. The Greenwood, Colo.-based firm's wealth focus was seeded five years ago when Empower purchased RIA Personal Capital for about $1 billion. Overall, its personal wealth division has reached $100 billion in client assets, marking a 25% compound annual growth rate since its personal wealth division was established in January 2023. However, even as the firm hits its latest wealth milestone, CEO and President Ed Murphy said it is interested in eventually acquiring a national RIA to further bolster the division. ""Near-term, it's continuing on this organic investment and growth that we've been driving in the personal wealth business,"" Murphy said. ""But before too long, I think there are opportunities through an acquisition to give us better distribution coverage and to augment the existing advisor force that we have with advisors that allow us to compete more effectively in the high-net-worth space."" Empower is no stranger to M&A, having built its retirement base over the years through acquisitions of large recordkeeping businesses from the likes of J.P. Morgan, Prudential and MassMutual. Beyond its deal for Personal Capital, which was a tech-focused advisory founded by Bill Harris, Empower entering the RIA acquisition space as a strategic acquirer would be new terrain. ""That's a muscle and a discipline that we have,"" Murphy said. ""We're also fortunate that we have a pretty good-sized balance sheet and a lot of support in our holding company and support to invest."" The firm is owned by Canada's Great-West Lifeco., a financial services holding company across insurance, asset management, investment and retirement. Murphy said Empower would be looking for more than advisor talent and a national footprint in such a deal; it would also need a management team skilled in the higher-net-worth market. ""For us, it wouldn't be just about adding the distribution capability -- in some cases, it would be adding management to augment what we already have,"" he said.

Eskom in digital push as it pivots to renewables,"Eskom, which has reported a profit for the first time in eight years, is relying on digitalisation as it aims to become a greener and more stable energy producer. The state-owned company, which was the utility everyone loved to hate, has transformed into an entity that currently provides reliable power, and has turned around operationally and financially following the implementation of a ""generation recovery plan"" two years ago. ""Eskom's stability and performance are vital to South Africa's growth and development, through sustained economic growth and job creation,"" says CEO Dan Marokane. It aims to deliver energy security in the evolving electricity industry, which demands customer-focused products and services to meet changing needs, enhanced grid capacity, and clean energy business models, it says. Transforming South Africa's electricity supply industry demands a modern, flexible and digitally-enabled power system, it adds in its integrated report for the year to March. ""Cyber security threats, outdated legacy systems with control weaknesses and the need for predictive analytics and data management are being addressed through comprehensive digital transformation initiatives,"" it states. Eskom is implementing ""advanced digital solutions"" to enhance operational efficiency and governance. ""These initiatives will not only modernise our infrastructure but also position the organisation to lead in a decentralised, digital and decarbonised energy future,"" it notes. Chairman Mteto Nyati points out in the report that the global environment is one in which the energy sector is transitioning towards decarbonisation and digitalisation, among other imperatives, such as opening the grid up to the private sector. Digital transformation is reshaping the energy sector, Eskom points out. ""Technologies such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics are enabling smarter grid management, operational efficiencies and improved forecasting."" The global digital transformation market is projected to grow at almost 25% each year for the next five years. ""For utilities, this presents opportunities to reduce costs, enhance reliability and improve customer service, although it introduces new cyber security and data privacy challenges,"" the company notes. Going digital is a ""strategic imperative"" and it will use technology to optimise operations. Digitalisation will also improve performance and keep up with the technology trends driving development of the electricity industry, Eskom says. ""We are accelerating investment in infrastructure, smart technologies and digitalisation across the value chain, by implementing advanced digital solutions to enhance governance,"" Eskom says. Alongside its drive to digitise is a push to introduce more renewable energy into the grid. It is engaging in strategic partnerships while establishing a renewable energy company - Eskom Green - to accelerate its participation in the green economy. Under a government directive, the state-owned company has been splitting into smaller, more competitive entities to improve efficiency, while also encouraging private sector involvement, especially in green power sources, to add renewable energy to the grid and ensure more power is made available. It states that the clean energy pipeline, to be driven by Eskom Green, includes at least 2GW of projects ready for execution in the short- to medium-term, with a longer-term pipeline of 5.9GW encompassing solar PV, wind, battery storage and gas-to-power projects. Based on figures from the Southern African Power Pool, this means Eskom Green will ultimately produce what works out to 10% of its current installed capacity, while the private sector - through independent power producer plans - will add another 14GW to the installed power base, based on the latest available figures. This comes as Nyati noted, during the results presentation yesterday, that Eskom had achieved 310 days of no load-shedding during the year to March compared with 2024, ""which was a disastrous year... where we had record levels of load-shedding"". Despite returning to profitability - R16 billion profit versus a loss of R55 billion last year - the company still received a qualified audit because of incomplete or inaccurately maintained records in terms of the Public Finance Management Act, a situation it wants to resolve within the next few years. There is also material uncertainty regarding Eskom's going concern status, driven by dependence on government support and uncertainties related to operational assumptions, including growing municipal debt. Three months after launching its three-year Audit Recovery Programme to achieve unqualified audit status, it has closed 90% of audit findings that go back as far as 2021, although this still needs to be confirmed by the auditors. ""But we continue with that momentum,"" says CFO Calib Cassim. One way it is improving its financial position is through the installation of smart meters, with a plan to roll out seven million of these in the next five years. Smart meters are seen as crucial to addressing the billions owed to Eskom by municipalities, which is already at R103 billion and could reach R300 billion by 2030. Eskom is also fundamentally overhauling the way it manages costs by changing the way it does business and ensuring it sustains those efficiencies moving ahead. It is modernising procurement processes by introducing systems such as e-tendering, price verification tools, digital stock control and e-auction systems to improve spend control and monitoring. Already, digitalisation and automation projects have improved revenue collection and operational efficiency. ""These interventions have positioned Eskom on a clearer path toward operational resilience and future growth,"" Nyati states.",ITWeb,2025-10-01T10:10:12Z,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/eskom-in-digital-push-as-it-pivots-to-renewables/5yONPvErYDP7XWrb,2025-10-01 18:30:08.000007,0.3803921568627451
Capitec now serves 25 million clients   | The Citizen,"Capitec has reported another period of significant growth, with a massive increase in headline earnings and client base. The Stellenbosch-based lender released its financial results for the six months ended 31 August 2025 on Wednesday. Capitec has been the leading bank by customer base for a while, and it has reported that it now serves at least 25 million clients. The bank's target market is the low-to-middle-income segment. ""We remained true to our fundamentals and executed our strategies, growing our active client base to 25 million,' said new CEO, Graham Lee. According to the interim results, the bank also has 14 million users on its banking app. Capitec prides itself on ""transparent banking services, including tech-savvy customers"". Capitec's headline earnings grew by 26% to R8 billion. Headline earnings are a way of measuring a company's core profit. Basically, how much money it makes from its main business activities, without the noise of unusual or one-off events. However, the bank's headline earnings are lower than those of other banks. For the first half of 2025, Standard Bank's headline earnings were R24 million, while Absa's were R11.9 billion. ALSO READ: Standard Bank pockets R24 billion in six months, while Capitec eyes earnings to surge above 22% Lee added that the bank's net interest income grew by 23% driven by 40% growth in loan disbursements and a 16% increase in interest income on lending. Interest income on investments and other financial instruments increased by 4% to R4.6 billion. Capitec generated a return on ordinary shareholders' equity (ROE) of 31%, with the bank's interim dividend also increased by 26% to 2,620 cents. Funeral and life cover income saw double-digit growth and increased to R1.4 billion. Operating profit before tax increased by 26% to R10.472 billion, from R8.309 billion in the comparative period. In the top five big banks, Capitec is the smallest bank by assets, worth more than R250 billion. The rest of the country's top banks have assets worth trillions of rands. The bank once overtook FirstRand as Africa's most valuable bank by market capitalisation; however, FirstRand quickly claimed its number one spot. Market capitalisation is the total value of a company's shares on the stock market. This shows how big or valuable the market thinks the company is. It is calculated by multiplying the share price by the total number of outstanding shares. As of midday on Wednesday, Capitec's market capitalisation was R411 billion. FirstRand's market capitalisation reached R434 billion, retaining its number one spot.",The Citizen,2025-10-01T10:13:22Z,https://www.citizen.co.za/business/capitec-now-serves-25-million-clients/,2025-10-01 18:30:08.000221,0.1843137254901961

'Tall Poppy Syndrome': How To Build Your Career Without The Stigma,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. We all want to stand out in the highly competitive and crowded job market. But it's not easy to become a rock star in today's workplace when you're hit hard by the brutal restrictions. Standing out is more challenging as employers tighten their budgets, restructure behind the scenes and continue with massive layoffs. As if those weren't enough barriers, sometimes your ride to success can be stalled by an obstacle known as ""Tall Poppy Syndrome,"" when coworkers criticize, penalize or tear you down because of your success. The term ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" refers to the metaphor of the tallest poppy in the field, standing out and in danger of being cut down. It originated in Australia, New Zealand and the UK to refer to situations where coworkers subtly penalize high performers with resentment and criticism for excelling or reaching heights of success. Penalties may include exclusion, undercutting or diminished recognition. In other words, colleagues block your career assent with the message, ""In your role at work, excited and stoked to climb the career ladder, you better not grow taller than the rest of us, or we'll chop you down."" The message is a way of keeping promising employees in their place until they've ""earned their stripes,"" even more so if you're a new, young employee or member of a disenfranchised minority group. I've seen ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" manifest as a power play in the workplace when established coworkers direct their ire toward ambitious employees like women: ""She's out of line. Who does she think she is?""; new hires, climbing the career ladder too fast: ""He's still wet behind the ears, needs taking down a few notches""; young Gen Z employees, insisting on flexibility and work-life balance: ""She bucks the system and is hard to manage""; or smart, creative workers with innovative ideas: ""He's a weirdo."" It's no wonder that ""quiet covering""--the tendency for employees to conceal personal aspects of themselves to avoid judgment and stereotypes, to fit in and appear more promotable--is trending in today's competitive workplace. Some of the most notable examples of ""covering"" are when employees minimize aspects of their personal attributes -- such as race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, disability or other characteristics -- in order to feel accepted, avoid layoffs and get promoted. Some level of conformity is normal and expected, essential for your team to function properly. It reflects adaptability and emotional intelligence, allowing individuals to navigate diverse social and professional contexts. It ensures that employees adhere to policies and procedures such as dress codes, company benefits, state and federal regulations, work hours to create operational scaffolding that builds common ground, good communication, comradery and workplace harmony. But there comes a point at which ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" is harmful. If you're afraid to speak up, think outside the box or stick out your neck for fear of disapproval or acceptance or have to excessively or chronically ""quiet cover"" at work, it can lead to stress, burnout and feelings of disconnection, undermining your morale, well-being and performance--and ultimately the company's bottom line. Organizations that foster self-expression, diversity, individuality and inventive ideas have higher engagement, allowing employees to draw on their strengths and add to the prosperity of your company. On the flip side, companies that pigeonhole you into narrow, tight roles with ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" force you to draw on your weaknesses, staying within strict confines that limit individual and company growth. Employees shackled with ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" are not members of the corporate showoff culture, nor are they rebels or troublemakers in the workplace. They're usually individualists, more likely to work together for the greater good of the company and ignore a coworker's contributions while investing more effort than necessary in their own. I spoke with Darin Patterson, vice president of market strategy at Make, who explains that when someone challenges the status quo, it makes others uncomfortable in a work setting. But he agrees with the research that those who experiment and push boundaries are needed as they actually move industries forward, even when their ideas meet resistance or skepticism. ""Taking chances is never easy and there is always a level of risk involved, yet playing it safe almost guarantees nothing will change."" Patterson told me that his team lives by what he calls the ""fail fast"" mindset, testing ideas quickly, learning from what works and what doesn't and refining until a strong solution emerges. ""Criticizing risk-takers only slows progress, while embracing setbacks creates space for true innovation,"" he asserts. ""Platforms like Make create the space and give innovators the tools to turn bold, risky ideas into actionable solutions that can completely disrupt an industry and reshape the way we work and lead."" While research is limited, data shows that ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" is getting worse, especially in the creative professions. And a handful of studies report that ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" has a negative economic impact on entrepreneurship, risk-taking and overall economic growth. I spoke with Emoke Starr, vice president of people at Lokalise. She told me if you find yourself the recipient of ""Tall Poppy Syndrome,"" the most effective response is to shift from individual wins to enterprise wins. ""Re-frame your achievements in terms of how they advance company priorities,"" she advises. ""Then, spotlight team contributions. This approach neutralizes resentment and strengthens your influence with leadership."" Starr believes that employees experiencing ""Tall Poppy Syndrome"" will benefit from building a coalition of advocates across the organization, documenting quantifiable results that align with revenue or growth and creating opportunities for team members to share the spotlight, tying your visibility to organizational growth. Patterson has some advice for someone in the habit of tearing down people for climbing the career ladder. He suggests that you take a step back and ask how you approached your ideas. ""There is a way to create an open space for innovation without criticizing and thwarting progress,"" he says. ""Lifting others up and collaborating rather than criticizing is how industries evolve. The people who do this are the ones driving change, and those that fight it risk getting left behind in the process."" What about you? Do you go along with the pack for fear of being ridiculed or labeled peculiar, insubordinate or non-compliant -- even when the common perspective is out of whack? If you follow the pack, do you think you're more likely to win the approval of corporate honchos and reach the top of the career ladder sooner? When you're willing to risk the label of ""Tall Poppy Syndrome,"" ask yourself what edge can you go to in your job? What unpredictable bridge can you jump off to sprout your wings? What limb can you reach to get to the fruit of the tree? Find that one place in your career where you've been hiding, then stretch from your comfort zone and stick your neck out. When all is said and done, you might find that remaining tight in a bud is more painful than the risk to bloom into the tallest poppy in the field.",Forbes,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2025/10/01/tall-poppy-syndrome-how-to-build-your-career-without-the-stigma/,2025-10-01 18:30:08.000841,0.03529411764705892
China approves reserve reports of two lithium producers,"China has approved reserve reports from two lithium producers in Yichun, providing some relief to market concerns over potential output disruptions, reported Bloomberg. This move comes as regulators closely scrutinise the sector's excess capacity. Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), whose Jianxiawo mine was suspended last month, has received reserve approval, the media outlet reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The clearance moves the sites closer to securing a mining permit and resuming operations, although there is no certainty. The two miners were part of a group of eight that were asked by the authorities in Yichun, located in the southern Chinese province of Jiangxi, to submit reports on their reserves by the end of September. This request followed an audit that revealed administrative shortcomings. The lithium hub has drawn attention in recent months as fears over supply tightened price fluctuations for the battery metal. The Jianxiawo mine has become the focal point of this turmoil after CATL, a leading global producer of electric vehicle batteries, announced in August that it would halt operations due to an inability to renew an expired mining permit. Battery manufacturing company Gotion High Tech has also received approval for mining design and ecological restoration plans at its Yichun site. The company stated that its lithium unit is allowed to mine based on production needs. CATL chose not to provide any comments, while Yichun's local government is yet to respond to requests for their input, reported the news agency. Meanwhile, China Mineral Resources Group, established by Beijing to enhance China's influence in the global iron ore market, has reportedly instructed domestic buyers to halt purchases of any dollar-denominated seaborne cargoes from BHP, reported Bloomberg. According to sources familiar with the situation, this directive means that no new agreements can be finalised, even for shipments that have already departed from Australia, where BHP operates its mines.",Mining Technology,2025-10-01T10:12:09Z,https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-approves-reserve-reports-two-lithium-producers/,2025-10-01 18:30:08.001008,0.01960784313725483
$7B RFG Advisory Hires Ed Swenson as President,"You can find original article here WealthManagement. to our free daily WealthManagement newsletters. Ed Swenson, who left Osaic this summer after leading the firm's RIA solutions division for about two years, has joined RFG Advisory, the Birmingham, Ala.-based hybrid RIA platform with more than $7 billion in assets, as president. He will also become a managing partner of the firm, alongside CEO Shannon Spotswood and Chief Investment Officer Rick Wedell. Spotswood served as president of the firm until July 2024, when she succeeded founder and CEO Bobby White, who moved into an executive chairman role. At that time, Wedell took on the role of president, in addition to his role as CIO. Swenson's appointment frees up Wedell to focus on the investment platform. In June, the firm launched a suite of active ETFs, The Bluemonte Funds. In his role, Swenson will be responsible for execution, scaling the business, personnel, revenues and costs, strategic relationships and RFG's tech strategy. He'll also help with its continued growth. The firm is quickly approaching $10 billion in assets, he said. ""There's no reason, in my mind, why we couldn't be managing or servicing upwards of $20, $30, $50 billion in assets over the next several years. So that's the goal,"" Swenson said. When asked about his departure from Osaic, Swenson said it was amicable and that he still has good relationships with the Osaic leadership team. ""One of the things that I've really focused on in the next leg of my career is, where do I see the most growth in the wealth industry across all channels? The most growth is coming out of the independent RIA market,"" he said. ""That's my background, and that's what I'm most excited about and where I see the future of growth in the industry. I have a lot of respect for [Osaic CEO] Jamie Price and have a lot of respect for that management team."" Swenson said he was attracted to RFG for its advisor-centric culture and the organic growth rates of its advisors. Broadly, the firm's advisors have an average annualized organic growth rate of 12.3%. He'll also help RFG build out its capital strategies group, in which the firm will take minority positions in its partner firms or help with financing for advisors to engage in M&A. That also includes RFG's Growth Alignment program, an equity swap program that allows partner firms to have ownership in RFG. Swenson first entered the industry in 1999 at Citigroup Asset Management, and worked as a portfolio manager and analyst at Legg Mason Asset Management before co-founding Dynasty in 2010, along with current CEO Shirl Penney and Todd Thomson, a member of the firm's board of directors.

"West Virginia treasurer calls for special session to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime","West Virginia State Treasurer Larry Pack called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state's tax on overtime and tips. (Photo by JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images) West Virginia State Treasurer Larry Pack on Tuesday called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and state lawmakers to eliminate the state's tax on overtime and tips. Pack asked officials to consider taking up the matter during a special legislative session. ""President Trump promised to abolish the tax on overtime pay and tips, a centerpiece for his tax policies,"" Pack said in a news release. ""The goal was to help blue-collar and service industry workers who often rely on overtime and tips to make ends meet. Combined with the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, President Trump has delivered, and then some, by enacting some of the largest federal tax cuts in history."" Pack also spoke about the proposal during an interview with Talkline on West Virginia MetroNews. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law this summer, cut federal taxes on tips and overtime. According to the IRS, workers of certain occupations can deduct tips up to $25,000 annually during tax years 2025 through 2028. Workers who receive overtime pay may also deduct the pay that exceeds their regular rate of pay -- for example, the ""half"" in ""time and a half"" pay, up to $12,500 annually or $25,000 for joint filers. According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the nonpartisan Urban and Brookings institutes that aims to improve tax and fiscal policy, while the tax cuts are popular, few will actually benefit from them. Only about 3% of households will benefit from the deduction for tipped income in 2026. Their average benefit is $1,400, but the average for all households is $40, according to the center. About 9% of workers will pay on average $1,400 less on their overtime as well, according to the Tax Policy Center. The average reduction for all households will be $130. In a statement Tuesday, Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the state should focus on policies that strengthen the economic security of all workers, but called eliminating the tax on overtime and tips a ""gimmick."" ""These policies help employers -- not workers -- by pushing more sectors to move to tips, which lowers costs for businesses while reducing economic stability for workers and costing consumers more,"" Allen said. ""We are all frustrated by the increasing number of transactions in which we are encouraged to tip, and these policies only exacerbate the issue. ""Similarly, no tax on overtime helps employers, not workers, by encouraging excessive hours of work and putting downward pressure on base wages,"" she said. ""Workers shouldn't have to work more than 40 hours per week to provide for their families."" Pack's proposal to eliminate tips and overtime from the state income tax comes as the state is already grappling with a potentially rocky future financial outlook. While the state ended fiscal year 2025 with a revenue surplus, growing expenses -- from the Public Employee Insurance Agency, the Hope Scholarship and potential federal budget cuts -- could pose challenges. The state is also still settling financially after implementing several cuts to personal income taxes in recent years. In 2024, according to the state budget office, West Virginia reported $826 million in surplus. Fiscal year 2025 ended in July, with the state reporting about $338 million in surplus, according to a news release from Morrisey. But most of that money was already spent and committed by the time the fiscal year ended due to supplemental appropriations passed in the 2025 regular session. In an emailed response Tuesday regarding Pack's request, Drew Galang, deputy press secretary for Morrisey, said the governor's administration is ""making the tough decisions to put our state in a great place to return money back to our people. ""We did the hard work of paying for the last set of tax cuts during the last legislative session and have begun to put our state on a solid long term financial trajectory,"" Galang wrote. ""This will position the governor and the Legislature to provide significant and broad based tax relief for West Virginians during the upcoming legislative session.""",Yahoo,2025-10-01T10:00:57Z,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/west-virginia-treasurer-calls-special-100057219.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.285747,0.1215686274509804
"'Balls leaving the park': Burlington cricket field too small, these measures are being considered","Options for repositioning Burlington's 10-year-old Central Park cricket field are being considered by city staff, in consultation with park neighbours and cricket players. City staff said they are also considering netting and additional signage for the cricket pitch in an area that is shared with other uses. ""The city is continuing to work with cricket players and neighbouring homeowners to protect property and personal safety, while supporting cricket,"" city communications staff stated in an email. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Harsh Singh of Halton Cricket Club said he met with city officials last week to discuss the Central Park cricket field's future. ""The current ground is not full-size, and its proximity to surrounding homes has raised a few concerns regarding noise and the balls leaving the park,"" Singh said. ""The city is actively exploring options to relocate the pitch within Central Park to mitigate this issue."" He has previously noted, in presentations to city councillors and media interviews, the need for full-size, dedicated cricket fields in Burlington. Last year, Singh explained to city councillors the undersized Central Park pitch is the only dedicated cricket field in the city, but with baseball diamonds on both sides, no lights, and not enough room for 360-degree play, there are challenges there. He explained cricket is played ""in the centre of an oval"" and spaces that include baseball diamonds and buildings nearby don't leave enough room. Last week, he noted the long-term plan is to have the new Sherwood Forest Cricket Ground operating by 2028 and for it to become Burlington's primary public cricket facility. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW A city tender for park improvement consultant services suggests the new cricket field could be constructed in 2027, pending budget approvals. ""Following this transition, the Central Park pitch would be dedicated specifically to youth and women's cricket programs,"" Singh said. ""We are optimistic that this phased approach will ultimately benefit the entire cricket community and the residents."" City communications staff noted Burlington's Live and Play Plan identified a need for three cricket fields, and funding for a full-size, dedicated cricket field at Sherwood Forest Park requires approval in the 2026 budget process. City staff have also met with Central Park neighbours who raised concerns about noise and cricket balls ending up in their yards. The Central Park cricket pitch opened for use in May 2015. A Burlington Post article at the time noted ""the diameter, at 60 yards, is 10 yards short of the 70 (to) 90 yards needed for a regulation game.""

What 'KPop Demon Hunters' Can Teach Us About Improving Job Quality,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. My household, like millions of others, has been swept up in the animated musical phenomenon KPop Demon Hunters. The film follows a trio of K-pop superstars on a secret mission to protect humanity from demons who are out to steal everyone's souls. As the soundtrack dominated our summer 2025 playlist, between the catchy songs and thrilling action, I noticed something surprising: The story reflects a challenge millions of American workers face every day -- job quality. Granted, demon hunter is not a job in the real world. But the fictional Huntr/x bandmates -- Rumi, Mira, and Zoey -- face dilemmas at work that resonate far beyond fantasy: How can I gain control over my schedule? Get the right training to succeed? Be myself without fear of fallout? Concerns like these, in addition to pay and benefits, are at the heart of understanding how many people have quality jobs in the United States -- and why, as a nation, we should care. Job quality issues influence worker satisfaction. And, as a result, they also influence outcomes businesses know matter, like employee engagement, retention, and productivity. New research, including early insights from my organization's collaboration with Gallup to examine job quality in the U.S., shows there's a lot of room for improvement. Many workers face unpredictable schedules or limited influence over decisions that affect them, such as which technologies their employers want them to use. Why focus on job quality now, when the labor market is slowing and more people are looking for work -- in, some cases, any work? In Demon Hunters, the stakes are crystal clear. If Rumi, Mira, and Zoey become disengaged or abandon their mission, the barrier protecting humanity collapses. In real life, the consequences may be less cinematic, but they are no less serious. Job quality affects worker well-being, organizational performance, and the economy's health. And we need more business leaders and policymakers to pay attention -- and take action. One reason job quality is often overlooked: a lack of data. Every month, the government reports how many people are employed and how much they earn. These are essential indicators of economic health, but they tell only part of the story. They don't show whether jobs enable workers -- and the economy as a whole -- to thrive. That's why my organization, Jobs for the Future, joined with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute to launch the American Job Quality Study, the first-ever comprehensive survey designed to measure job quality across the U.S. workforce. (The results will be released in October.) We see this study, which has surveyed nearly 20,000 workers so far, as a baseline for future research and a tool for driving progress. The study defines job quality using five areas that research shows matter most to workers and businesses: financial well-being, growth and development opportunities, work structure and autonomy, workplace culture and safety, and agency and voice. Huntr/x may not explicitly sing about these themes, but their experiences vividly illustrate them. When it comes to financial well-being, the Huntr/x girls are golden. They live in a penthouse, fly private, and seem to have endless perks. They certainly don't need to worry about fair pay and benefits that meet their basic needs, as millions of today's workers do. Growth opportunities aren't lacking either. Before battling a single demon, they receive intensive training from their mentor, Celine, and pursue well-defined goals. In today's rapidly changing labor market, the opportunity to build new skills and see a clear path forward is vital to career success. However, access to training is uneven in the United States, and too many workers feel they have no chance to advance. But when it comes to scheduling and autonomy, the picture changes. After a grueling world tour, Mira and Zoey finally collapse into vacation mode -- only to be pulled back by Rumi, who secretly releases their new single and pressures them to promote it. Work-life balance? Not for Huntr/x. At this point, they have zero control over their working conditions. Millions of U.S. workers also want more say over key decisions that affect their work and a stable, predictable schedule. Physical safety is fundamental to job quality, and the demon hunters always escape injury. But they struggle at first with other forms of safety, such as feeling respected and supported at work, regardless of one's identity. The movie's plot centers on Rumi's secret; she's part-demon herself and hides it from her colleagues and manager, out of fear of being excluded. As it turns out, Mira and Zoey also hide parts of who they are. But eventually, by bringing their full selves to the task at hand -- by recognizing and respecting each other's strengths -- the group functions more effectively as a team, positioning them to meet their most critical deadline and succeed. My organization's research with Gallup to be released later this fall will include data on the portion of the U.S. workforce that reports having been treated unfairly or experiencing discrimination on the job because of their identity. Just as the threat of soul-stealing demons looms over Huntr/x, the challenge of improving job quality constantly hovers over our economy. Left unchecked, it can erode worker well-being, business performance, and our collective prosperity. Whether hiring is booming or slowing, now is the moment to put job quality at the top of the national agenda. It's not optional, it's essential. We won't solve every problem overnight, but we must take this opportunity to do better by American workers and businesses and improve job quality for all. As Huntr/x belts out in ""Golden,"" their biggest hit: ""It's our moment."" If we seize it.",Forbes,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariaflynn/2025/10/01/what-kpop-demon-hunters-can-teach-us-about-improving-job-quality/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.287505,0.3803921568627451
"X22 Report  --  Eric Trump and Clay Clark: Bitcoin is Digital Gold, D's Push their Attacks, Country is Waking up","The latest broadcast from the X22 Report on Rumble offered a powerful and wide-ranging conversation, drawing connections between high-stakes political pressure, centralized financial control, and the burgeoning movement toward digital assets. Featuring Eric Trump and business conference organizer Clay Clark, the episode, titled ""Eric Trump/Clay Clark - Bitcoin Is Digital Gold, [DS]/D's Push Their Attacks, The Country Is Waking Up,"" provided listeners with insights into the personal battles faced by the Trump family and a significant recommendation for financial self-defense: Bitcoin. The conversation kicked off with Eric Trump discussing his new book, ""Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation."" The book serves as a chronicle of the intense pressure and scrutiny the family has faced, both during the Presidency and since. This narrative of relentless institutional opposition provides the crucial backdrop for the financial arguments made later in the broadcast. For the guests, the constant attempt by centralized entities to control or neutralize their political and financial power demonstrates a need for alternative systems of wealth preservation. Crucially, the challenges faced by the Trump family led Eric Trump to an exploration of decentralized finance. He highlighted the severe predicament of being ""de-banked"" -- a contemporary form of financial censorship where institutions refuse services based on political alignment. This experience proved to be the catalyst for his understanding and appreciation of Bitcoin. Eric Trump made a firm case for Bitcoin as ""Digital Gold."" This comparison is key to the argument: just as gold has historically served as a hedge against inflation and political instability, Bitcoin offers a modern, digital alternative. Its decentralized nature means that traditional banking institutions -- and by extension, hostile bureaucratic forces -- cannot easily freeze, seize, or arbitrarily de-value holdings. The core message here is one of financial sovereignty. When centralized institutions are weaponized, alternative, non-custodial assets become not merely investment vehicles, but essential tools for political and financial freedom. Bitcoin, in this view, is the necessary shield against centralized attempts to ""harm your wealth."" Beyond the personal and political narrative, the conversation broadened to the economic resilience of the nation, largely driven by the insights of Clay Clark. Clark, known for organizing large-scale business conferences, emphasized the importance of building robust, independent businesses as a mechanism for countering centralized control. He discussed his upcoming Business Conference with Eric Trump (hosted through Time To Free America), which aims to connect entrepreneurs and help individuals build or expand their businesses. This focus reinforces the idea that true freedom requires economic independence. As businesses and individuals become less reliant on legacy financial systems and centralized supply chains, they gain greater autonomy. This concept ties directly into the final major theme of the broadcast: The Country Is Waking Up. The guests posited that the continuous pressure and exposure of institutional actions are having a net positive effect -- they are forcing citizens to become more aware of the risks inherent in centralized systems and inspiring a shift toward self-reliance, both financially and economically. The rising interest in decentralized currency and independent entrepreneurship is seen as direct evidence of this national awakening. The X22 Report episode with Eric Trump and Clay Clark was fundamentally a discussion about resilience. It argued that facing intense pressure -- whether political, legal, or financial -- has catalyzed a necessary evolution toward personal and economic independence. From the detailed recount of being ""Under Siege"" to the strong advocacy for Bitcoin as a mechanism of financial defense, the broadcast delivers a clear message: as centralized attacks persist, the counter-force must be decentralized growth, financial awareness, and entrepreneurial spirit. For those interested in exploring the detailed arguments on financial freedom, the necessity of digital currency, and the role of entrepreneurs in the current political climate, you can watch the full video on Rumble: Eric Trump/Clay Clark - Bitcoin Is Digital Gold,[DS]/D's Push Their Attacks, The Country Is Waking Up Streamed on: Sep 30, 2:01 pm EDT https://rumble.com/v6zof6k-eric-trumpclay-clark-bitcoin-is-digital-golddsds-push-their-attacksthe-coun.html?e9s=src_v1_ucp_a Today's Guest: Eric Trump & Clay Clark Book: Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation Website: https://erictrumpbook.com https://amzn.to/4nqM6FB Website: Business Conference With Eric Trump https://timetofreeamerica.com Eric Trump kicks off the conversation talking about his new book, Under Siege, My family's fight to save our nation. The Trump family came under attack when President trump was in office and when he was running for office. The family was subpoenaed, de-banked, sued, indicted and there were multiple attempts on the President's life. Clay talks about the business conference in Dec, they business conference consists of entrepreneurs like Eric Trump and they are going to help people build or expand their businesses. Eric talks about when he and his family were de-banked and he discovered bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold and the banks cannot do anything to harm your wealth, as the [DS]/D's continue to attack the country the country is waking up. ______________________________________________________ Contact Author If you wish to contact the author of this article.

The SBA has already distributed $6.4 million in flood relief in Wisconsin. Here's how to apply.,"The U.S. Small Business Administration has distributed more than $6.4 million in federal disaster loans to Wisconsin businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters affected by the historic August floods, the agency announced. As of Sept. 30, the SBA said it had provided more than $6.1 million to residents and $317,500 to businesses in the wake of the floods. These loans are separate from Federal Emergency Management Agency aid, which is available to residents in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Washington counties. ""Surpassing $6.4 million in disaster loans reflects more than just numbers -- it represents small businesses reopening, families returning home and communities rebuilding more effectively,"" said Chris Stallings, associate administrator for the SBA's Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience, in a Tuesday news release. ""These loans provide vital support for recovery, and we encourage anyone still in need to apply before the deadline."" Here's what to know about SBA loans for Wisconsin flood relief, including who's eligible and how to apply: Here's an overview of the available Small Business Administration loans and deadlines for each, according to information from Gov. Tony Evers' office: The SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is available to small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives and private nonprofit organizations that have incurred financial losses due to the floods, according to the news release. In addition to physical damage, the loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other bills not paid because of the floods. Agricultural producers, farmers, or ranchers -- with the exception of small aquaculture enterprises -- are not eligible for the loans. Businesses and nonprofits may borrow up to $2 million, while renters and homeowners may borrow up to $100,000 for disaster-related expenses. The SBA will set loan amounts and terms based on individual applicants' financial conditions. Some applicants may be eligible for a 20% loan increase for mitigation efforts, which can include strengthening structures to protect against high wind damage or landscaping for better drainage. The SBA will verify any such efforts before approving the loan increase. Interest rates for the loans are as low as 4% for businesses, 3.625% for nonprofits, and 3% for homeowners and renters, with terms up to 30 years, the agency said. Interest does not begin to accrue, and payments are not due until 12 months from the first loan payment. Wisconsin residents, businesses and nonprofits can apply for disaster loans online through the MySBA Loan Portal at lending.sba.gov.

"After Getting a $5 Billion Investment From Nvidia, Is It Off to the Races for Intel's Stock? | The Motley Fool","Shares of Intel have been rallying of late, but they're still down close to 30% over the past five years. Intel (INTC -2.74%) has suddenly become one of the hottest stocks to own of 2025. Its year-to-date return was a staggering 77% as of the end of last week. Investors have been seeing plenty of reasons to take a chance on the stock despite its lackluster financials. The U.S. government took a 10% stake in the business and leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA 2.54%) has also announced it will invest $5 billion into the company. Is this a clear sign that Intel is a safe stock to own again, and that it could be due for an even greater rally? The timing of the Nvidia investment is intriguing, since the news comes after the government recently announced it was taking a 10% stake in Intel. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been fairly close with the U.S. government as the two sides brokered a deal where the chipmaker would be able to sell its chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut going to the government. This recent move may have been as part of a way for Nvidia to win more favor from the government, which has been pushing hard for more chip production in the U.S. For Intel, getting an influx of cash is important as the company's free cash flow over the trailing 12 months has been negative, totaling a loss of $10.9 billion. While the companies will work together, a key detail that's noteworthy is that Intel's foundry will not be making chips for Nvidia. And it's Intel's foundry business that has been struggling mightily to show that it can win over big customers and be a major growth driver for Intel in the future. Huang says he's still evaluating the foundry and the lack of firm commitment may be the most telling piece of this investment. Although a $5 billion investment may be significant, for a company of Nvidia's size, which has generated $87 billion in profit over the past 12 months, it's by no means an investment that will make or break its operations. Obtaining an investment from Nvidia may sound great at first glance, but without a commitment to its foundry, there are still some significant doubts about Intel's long-term success. Consider just how unimpressive the company's results have been in recent years. There has been limited growth for Intel and its bottom line has frequently been in the red or just barely above breaking even. The big overarching question is whether Intel's foundry business can truly be successful and make quality, high-performing chips in the U.S. and be able to compete effectively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which utilizes a labor market where wages are far lower than in the U.S. For now, Intel still has a lot to prove. The market has a way of overreacting to news in the short term. And over a longer period, things usually calm down. That's what I think may end up happening with Intel's stock. News of the U.S. government and Nvidia investing in the business may sound promising at first, but that doesn't mean that Intel is suddenly on a path to profitability or that it has become a less risky buy overnight. At the end of the day, what matters is how the business is actually performing, not who has invested in it. A company like Nvidia can afford to make a $5 billion investment into Intel and not lose sleep over it because its profits are so massive. But for the average investor, even putting a few thousand dollars into this tech stock may not be a great idea given the significant uncertainty around Intel's operations. Given all the question marks around Intel's future, a wait-and-see approach may be the best one to take with the stock right now.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-01T10:13:38Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/after-getting-a-5-billion-investment-from-nvidia-i/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.290397,0.1607843137254903
Inside The Booming Multi-Thousand-Dollar Gem Tourism Trend,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Trang Do has worked in the jewelry industry for over two decades and realized early on that gems are not just about sparkle, but about memory and meaning. ""For serious collectors and connoisseurs, the journey to find a stone is just as important as the piece itself,"" she says. Since founding her bespoke jewelry brand Kimjoux in 2010, she has noted a growing trend in gemstone tourism, as more and more customers seek the story behind their stone. ""When you've walked through a Sri Lankan sapphire market or seen an emerald being cut in Colombia, that memory stays with you. It transforms the jewel from just a purchase into part of their life story,"" Do says. Alex Wix, co-founder of specialist travel agency Wix Squared, says they're also seeing plenty of demand for gem-focused trips. ""We often have clients looking to buy their partner jewelry whilst on holiday as the ultimate keepsake. We arrange meetings with gemologists, jewelry designers and visits to authentic gem shops in lots of our destinations,"" she says. It is common for gem aficionados to travel to established trade hubs such as Antwerp, Geneva, or Dubai. But the rising tourism trend is to visit the locations where stones are sourced. ""Sourcing at origin is visceral,"" says Do. ""When you stand at a mine in Sri Lanka or meet cutters in Bogotá, you feel the human and natural story behind the stone. It's raw, emotional, sometimes chaotic, but unforgettable."" Hubs like Antwerp or Dubai offer unparalleled access to global expertise, gem labs, and the most rarefied stones gathered in one place. But Do posits that origin travel gives customers a human connection and a sense of authenticity that a polished showroom can't replicate. Wix sees gem tourism as part of the burgeoning preference for experiential travel. ""I believe that we are seeing a growing demand for jewelry tourism very much alongside the desire to have immersive and luxury experiences whilst on vacation, including gaining behind-the-scenes access and bespoke craftsmanship,"" she says. For her clients, she curates trips that include private drivers and guides and accommodation in prime hotels to create a 360 exclusive experience. For Do, visiting a stone's source also adds value to a purchased piece. ""I see firsthand how collectors today are looking for both heart and head. They might fall in love with a sapphire for its color, but they're also weighing its long-term value. Jewelry tourism often serves a dual purpose: the emotional and the financial,"" she says. ""Seeing a gem at its source, with trusted guidance, builds confidence in its authenticity and provenance. And because the finest stones, like Kashmir sapphires, Colombian emeralds, or Argyle pink diamonds, are finite, they're effectively an asset class. So jewelry travel is often both romance and investment research rolled into one."" For Do, classic gem tourism destinations include Tanzania for tanzanite, South Africa and Botswana for diamonds, and Sri Lanka for sapphires and rubies. As tastes are changing from traditional ""assets"" to more colourful and investable semi-precious stones, newer destinations are also emerging, such as Mozambique for the tropical sea-hued paraiba and Vietnam for spinel in vivid tones of red, mauve and violet. The way of visiting these destinations is also changing. ""Transparency is no longer optional; it's a responsibility. Many jewelry tours today integrate visits to ethical mines, fair-trade workshops, and initiatives that support local communities,"" Do says. ""Clients want reassurance that their jewels were sourced responsibly and that the people behind them were respected and fairly compensated."" Do also says technology will shape the journey, such as blockchain certificates, digital provenance, and even virtual mine tours paired with physical travel. ""The future of gem tourism is about blending the magic of travel with the reassurance of transparency and ethics,"" she says.",Forbes,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccahughes/2025/10/01/inside-the-booming-multi-thousand-dollar-gem-tourism-trend/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.291150,0.05098039215686279
Imee Marcos slams 'rushed' Konektadong Pinoy Act,"Senator Imee Marcos on Wednesday, 1 October, lamented that the deadline for comments on the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the newly enacted Konektadong Pinoy (KP) Act is ""too rushed."" Marcos, the principal author of the law, warned that both the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) may be using the IRR to sabotage the intent of the measure by giving stakeholders only 15 days from publication to submit comments. The senator made the remark as the DICT set Thursday, 2 Oct., as the deadline for comments on the IRR of the KP Act, stressing that its transparency clause is ""self-executory and must not be delayed or undermined by restrictive provisions in the IRR."" ""If they could not threaten the President into vetoing the bill, then their fallback is to bury booby traps into the IRR to keep small players out and protect the entrenched telcos. This must not be allowed,"" she stressed. In a formal letter to the DICT, furnished also to the NTC, Philippine Competition Commission, Department of Justice, Commission on Audit, and Department of Finance/Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management, Marcos ordered the immediate release of a complete national spectrum baseline. This baseline must include: all frequency bands and blocks (700 MHz, 850/900, 1800, 2100, 2300, 2600, 3.3-3.8 GHz, 26/28/39 GHz, satellite, microwave, VHF/UHF); assignments and transfers since 2010 with their legal bases, terms, and beneficial owners; utilization data such as sites on-air, MHz×POP, traffic levels, and idle capacity; compliance records on coverage and quality-of-service commitments, spectrum caps and variances; as well as pending applications, public-safety allocations, and broadcast holdings. She emphasized that if a computerized registry cannot be produced, certified photocopies of all underlying assignments and orders must be submitted. ""The law is clear: transparency is mandatory. Failure to submit the spectrum baseline will trigger a show-cause order, and if necessary, a direct instruction to NTC to deliver the full registry and documents,"" she declared. Marcos stressed that the KP Act aims to democratize telecommunications by opening spectrum access to new and smaller players. Without immediate disclosure, the public cannot know which frequencies are hoarded, underutilized, or locked away in secret deals. ""Transparency is the first firewall against monopoly. The Filipino people deserve to know who holds our nation's airwaves, how they are used, and why so much remains idle while connectivity gaps persist,"" Marcos said.",Daily Tribune,2025-10-01T10:06:55Z,https://tribune.net.ph/2025/10/01/imee-marcos-slams-rushed-konektadong-pinoy-act,2025-10-01 18:30:10.291629,-0.0980392156862745

EU country mobilizes reservists after drone incidents - media  --  RT World News,"The Danish dual-use Aalborg airport and military base was forced to close last week after unidentified UAVs were spotted nearby Denmark has called up hundreds of reservists to boost security after mysterious drone sightings near strategic sites, broadcaster TV2 reported on Tuesday. Air traffic at the dual-use airport and military base at Aalborg was briefly suspended last week after unidentified ""drones"" were spotted near the runway - the latest in a series of unexplained sightings. Another alleged drone sighting took place at the base hosting Denmark's F-16 and F-35 fighter jets. At Aalborg, despite hours of monitoring, the aircraft were never identified. Days earlier, Copenhagen Airport - the busiest in the Nordic region - was forced to halt flights for hours after similar sightings. According to TV2, the Danish Armed Forces Command issued a classified order on Sunday calling up part of its reserve force in response to the ""complex situation"" with drone flights. Several hundred reservists were reportedly summoned, though the exact number is unclear. Denmark has not released reserve figures in recent years, but in 2013 the Main Organization for Reserve Personnel estimated the number at about 3,000. The Defense Command did not respond to TV2's requests for comment. Denmark imposed a temporary ban on civilian drones after last week's sightings, warning that violations could bring fines or prison terms of up to two years. The ban runs through Friday as the country - which holds the rotating EU presidency - hosts an informal European Council meeting in Copenhagen. The gathering is expected to discuss an EU-wide ""drone wall,"" an initiative that reportedly began last week after alleged airspace violations in Poland, Estonia, and Romania, which were blamed without evidence on Russia. Moscow has denied involvement in the airspace violations. Speaking at the UN on Saturday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the accusations Western ""scaremongering.""",RT,2025-10-01T10:13:01Z,https://www.rt.com/news/625683-denmark-reservists-drone-sightings/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.292107,-0.1372549019607843
"Signature International to expand its reach, eyes 60 showrooms nationwide","KOTA DAMANSARA: Signature International Bhd is targeting 60 showrooms nationwide, aiming to strengthen its reach among Tier-1 and Tier-2 property developers and customers. Group CEO KS Lau said the company, which already operates 50 outlets, plans to add about 10 stores while also branching into new lifestyle concepts. ""We are nurturing our existing stores and gradually adding more. The next step is to expand into curtain and furniture shops, creating an ecosystem where customers can choose one store or combine them into a lifestyle destination,"" he told SunBiz at the launch of its 31st anniversary campaign today. Lau said Signature International is carefully choosing prime locations for its expansion, focusing on major cities and large townships where accessibility, safety and customer convenience are assured. ""Location is everything. High-end customers expect good accessibility, parking and a safe environment. That is why our new stores will continue to open in Tier-1 cities like Johor and Penang, as well as in large townships with strong growth potential,"" he added. Signature International has already established its presence across most major cities in Malaysia, including Ipoh, Penang, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Malacca and Negeri Sembilan. ""Every new township we see as a growth opportunity, and that is why you will find us in nearly every state capital today. Our strategy is to ensure that customers, wherever they are in key urban centres, have access to our stores and our promise of quality,"" said Lau. Looking ahead, the company is turning its focus towards second-tier cities as well, aiming to bring its products and lifestyle concepts to communities beyond state capitals.

These may be smaller stores, but they will give more people the chance to experience our quality products and elevate their living standards,"" Lau said. Signature International has also expanded into East Malaysia, with outlets in Kuching, Bintulu, Sibu and Miri in Sarawak, and in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. The company has a presence in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. ""We already have a presence in key cities across Sabah and Sarawak, allowing customers to experience our products. However, these outlets are typically smaller in scale compared to those in Peninsular Malaysia,"" Lau said. He added that the company's interior fit-out segment is sharpening its focus on the commercial sector, which includes hotels, corporate towers, hospitality, wellness, food and beverage, and retail projects. ""We see strong opportunities in this space. Recently, we completed projects for Alliance Bank's corporate tower, renovations for Maybank and Merdeka 118, as well as hotels. These contracts represent a significant revenue stream that supports the growth of our business."" Lau said government support for foreign direct investment and the steady inflow of multinational corporations into Malaysia are creating new demand for high-quality interiors. ""While our built-in furniture business continues to serve the premium retail segment, the commercial fit-out business allows us to scale sustainably. By offering a complete solution - from cabinetry and furniture to bedding, flooring and curtains - we can increase the value per customer and strengthen our position as a total home and lifestyle solutions provider,"" he explained.

What You Need to Know About Annuities,"I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement. Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: How do income annuities work, and how they are different from investing in something that pays out income like bonds? A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end. Q: How can these types of annuities help with retirement planning? A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household's basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses -- housing, taxes, healthcare -- total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That's an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it. Q: Savings annuities, or ""deferred annuities,"" allow investors to get market exposure in addition to income. What are some key savings annuity types? A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you're in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular ""fixed index"" annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. Q: These products are more complicated than income annuities, and they carry more risk and higher costs. How can investors make sure they know what they're getting into with these products? A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. Q: What are the tax implications of annuities? A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Struggling China Vanke To Sell Off Businesses At Popular Ski Resort,"Struggling China Vanke, one of the country's largest real estate developers, plans to sell the operations of a popular ski resort to a majority state-owned tourism and travel company, according to a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Eyeing growth in China's ski industry, Hong Kong-listed China Travel International Investment has agreed to pay 295 million yuan, or $41 million, to a subsidiary of China Vanke for 100% ownership of Jilin Songhua Lake International Resorts, the operator of Lake Songhua Ski Resort. The Jilin company also owns the Lake Songhua Resort, the Seibu Prince Hotel, Zhanyun Salomon Hotel, Qingshan Apartment and ""a business town,"" China Travel International Investment said in the filing. China Travel International Investment, also through its CTS Scenery subsidiary, would additionally pay five million yuan for full ownership of of Beijing Wanbingxue Sports, whose business covers ski resort development and planning, construction consulting, operation management, marketing promotion and ski coaching. It manages nine well-known ski resorts, the announcement said. ""This project is in line with the company's development strategy for urban and leisure resort products,"" China Travel International Investment said. ""It represents an important choice to seize historic opportunities, cultivate new growth poles, and expand into the snow economy. The project as a whole is of high strategic significance."" The company earlier said it has planned to hold 75% of each of the two businesses. China's ski industry has enjoyed rapid growth in the past decade following the country's winning bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The number of skier visits at domestic ski resorts climbed by nearly 13% in the year ending April 30 to a record 26 million, according to the China Ski Industry White Paper. Lake Songhua Ski Resort is located in northeastern China's Jilin province, one of the country's top ski regions. What has been billed as the world's largest indoor ski resort was set to open in Shenzhen, a rich southern tech hub, on Sept. 29. Fitch Ratings, the rating agency, in August downgraded China Vanke's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings amid the country's current real estate supply glut. ""The downgrade reflects further weakening in China Vanke's liquidity,"" it said. Fitch believes ""timely and continued support"" from Shenzhen Metro Group, China Vanke's largest shareholder, ""is essential for China Vanke to address its financial obligations, as Fitch forecasts its free cash flow to remain negative in the near term."" China Vanke's Hong Kong-traded shares have lost more than 80% of their value from a 2018 all-time high. The purchase could help add needed life China Travel International Investment's scenic revenue. In the first half, business was ""affected by factors such as consumption segmentation, lack of new products and activities, and climate change,"" resulting in a year-on-year decline in overall revenue and profit, according to China Travel International Investment's interim report. Among Chinese companies eyeing winter sports growth has been sportswear maker Anta Sports, chaired by billionaire Ding Shizhong. An Anta-led group purchased Europe-based Amer Sports in 2019, gaining ownership of some of the world's most popular winter sports brands including Arc'teryx, Salomon and Atomic. Among U.S. firms with a large China ski industry presence, Vermont-based snowboard maker Burton is the No. 1 snowboard brand in the country, the China Ski Industry White Paper said.

"SMEs 'squeezed by sudden jumps in costs', warns Cork Business Association","Cork's small and medium businesses are ""bracing themselves"" ahead of anticipated financial burdens in the new year, the Cork Business Association (CBA) has said. A spokesperson for the CBA explained that with a likely hike in the national minimum wage, the possibility that Vat will not be reduced for hospitality businesses in the Budget, and the full commencement of pension auto-enrolment, many SMEs fear that the combined burden could be more than they can absorb. It comes as the Low Pay Commission has reportedly recommended a 5% increase to the national minimum wage, which would take it from €13.50 per hour to around €14.15 per hour if approved by government. The spokesperson said that this will impact all salary bands, and that larger businesses may already operate pension schemes or pay above the minimum wage and thus feel less impact, but CBA is predicting vulnerable small businesses already under strain will be most affected. There is concern that employers may be forced to reduce staff hours, delay hiring, or absorb the cost in a way that jeopardises viability, CBA president Dave O'Brien said, or there may be more closures in January. Mr O'Brien explained that these challenges do not exist in a vacuum. ""Many in hospitality are still recovering from the increase in Vat rates -- which Government has hinted will not be reversed in the upcoming Budget -- squeezing already narrow margins across pubs, restaurants, and cafés. ""Overlay this with the introduction of pension auto-enrolment from 1 January 2026, and the weight on small employers, including other struggling sectors like retail, becomes heavier still."" Businesses are also being hit by the continued rise in food and raw material costs, and in particular soaring regulation-related charges on energy, which show no sign of abating, he continued. ""Certain sectors are already operating on thin profit margins, and are bracing themselves for more costs in the New Year, meaning any additional wage cost will be acutely felt. ""They are being squeezed from multiple directions. Sudden jumps in wage, pension and operating costs may force tough decisions. One change at a time is manageable; many at once is perilous."" He called for the government to ""consider that wage rises beyond sustainable levels can lead to reduced hiring, staff cuts, or automation"", adding that SMEs are the backbone of the Irish economy and must not be ""squeezed out"". The CBA is calling for phased implementation and supports and for the government to work with local business groups, Mr O'Brien said. Rather than front-loading all changes at once, sectors with low margins should receive support like grants, tax credits and PRSI relief, to buffer the impact. ""Advisory services, subsidies, or interest free loans could be introduced to help businesses manage payroll systems, compliance, and financial planning around these changes,"" he suggested. ""We understand that workers must see their contribution valued in the form of fair wages and future pension security. However, asking too much, too soon, risks destabilising the very businesses that create those jobs. If businesses grow, so, too, will salaries.""",Echo Live,2025-10-01T10:07:00Z,https://www.echolive.ie/corknews/arid-41715672.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.296411,-0.1764705882352942
"Crypto Price Prediction Today: XRP, Aster, and Cardano","As October kicks off, traders are once again glued to the charts, searching for signals that could define the month ahead. After a shaky September, attention has turned to three key players: XRP, Aster, and Cardano. Each coin is entering October with its own momentum, challenges, and catalysts. From ETF buzz surrounding XRP and Cardano to Aster's bid for broader adoption, the market is bracing for moves that could set the tone for the final quarter of 2025. In this analysis, the crypto price prediction today explores where these assets might be heading and what traders should watch closely. XRP is trading at $2.84, up 1.7% over the last 24 hours with a market cap of $170.23 billion. Traders say the coin is still digesting September's volatility, but fresh optimism is building around the possibility of new ETF listings. Market chatter suggests that October could bring long-awaited approvals, which could give XRP the momentum to retest the $3.20 level. On X, crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe wrote, ""XRP remains one of the most technically undervalued majors. A break above $3 could unlock a new leg up."". The comment captures the bullish undercurrent despite short-term corrections. For October, the crypto price prediction today for XRP points toward a trading band between $2.70 and $3.40, with ETF developments as the deciding catalyst. Aster (ASTER) sits at $1.56, down from its highs but showing signs of consolidation. The project, which emphasizes interoperability and decentralized apps, recently expanded partnerships in Asia. That news hasn't fully translated into price action yet, but analysts note that such deals can build long-term confidence. Technically, the RSI indicates Aster is approaching an oversold condition. If liquidity holds steady, bulls may eye the $1.80 resistance before attempting to reclaim the $2 mark. In the broader scope of crypto price prediction today, ASTER could range between $1.40 and $1.95 through October, provided volume supports recovery. Market watchers say the coin's narrative depends on adoption milestones. As one Tokyo-based strategist noted, ""If Aster keeps securing real-world integrations, traders may see this as more than just a speculative play."" Cardano (ADA) is priced at $0.8035, posting a slight gain in the last 24 hours and holding a $28.78 billion market cap. While ADA's price remains below its historic highs, October is expected to be eventful. Talk of a potential ADA ETF has created ripples, with some experts claiming institutional inflows could drive the token toward $1.20 in the near term. On X, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's founder, recently commented, ""Cardano's fundamentals remain stronger than ever. The community is building, and global adoption is our North Star."". This underscores the project's long-term vision, which is often contrasted with short-term volatility. For the crypto price prediction today, ADA could hold between $0.78 and $1.05, with an outside chance at higher levels if ETF momentum translates into capital inflows. The broader crypto market continues to dance between optimism and caution. With XRP, Aster, and Cardano all eyeing institutional catalysts, October could be defined by ETF decisions, adoption stories, and global liquidity trends. Investors are reminded, however, that while technical indicators show promise, regulatory clarity and macroeconomic shifts remain unpredictable variables. In sum, crypto price prediction today paints a picture of cautious optimism. XRP looks primed for ETF-driven moves, Aster seeks validation from partnerships, and Cardano holds steady with community strength and ETF speculation. As October begins, XRP, Aster, and Cardano each carry their own storylines. XRP leans on ETF momentum, Aster on adoption breakthroughs, and Cardano on community strength and institutional speculation. Together, they highlight how crypto price prediction today is never one-size-fits-all but rather a mix of technical signals, global news, and investor psychology. 1. What is the crypto price prediction today for XRP? XRP is expected to trade between $2.70 and $3.40, with ETF decisions shaping its direction. 2. Where could Aster price go in October? Aster may range between $1.40 and $1.95, depending on adoption news and technical strength. 3. Can Cardano break above $1 this month? Yes, if ETF speculation materializes, ADA could test $1.05 to $1.20. 4. What risks should investors watch? Regulatory outcomes, global liquidity, and prolonged oversold conditions are key risks. RSI (Relative Strength Index): A momentum indicator showing if a coin is overbought or oversold. ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund): A regulated investment product that can increase crypto exposure to institutions. Market Cap: The total value of a cryptocurrency calculated by price multiplied by circulating supply. Liquidity: The ease with which a token can be bought or sold without large price swings. Resistance Level: A price point where selling pressure is expected to outweigh buying pressure. Consolidation: A period when prices stabilize before a breakout or breakdown.",The Bit Journal,2025-10-01T10:13:09Z,https://thebitjournal.com/crypto-price-prediction-today-xrp-aster-cardano/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.297120,0.08235294117647052

Six companies closed facilities in August impacting 747 workers in Wisconsin,"Six companies informed the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development that they closed facilities impacting 747 workers in September. That's a dramatic increase from August when only 93 workers were laid off. The state's unemployment rate has remained low at roughly 3.1%, compared to the nation's 4.3% according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state's labor force participation rate ticked down to 64.8% in August however the national rate increased slightly to 62.3%, according to the DWD.

What You Need to Know About Annuities,"A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end.",Winnipeg Sun,2025-10-01T10:08:20Z,https://winnipegsun.com/pmn/what-you-need-to-know-about-annuities,2025-10-01 18:30:10.298213,0.06666666666666665
welding and grinding solution for dynamic SA agri sector challenges,"Agriculture in South Africa is evolving. From on-site meat processing and precision fabrication to equipment repairs and infrastructure upkeep, today's agricultural operations are increasingly complex, self-sufficient and technologically-driven. This shift is placing new demands on the tools the agri sector relies on - not just for efficiency, but for safety, hygiene, and durability. First Cut, a leading South African supplier of professional cutting, welding, grinding and processing equipment, is aligning its offering to meet these changing requirements, ensuring that the tools behind agriculture evolve in step with the sector itself. From meat processing to general farm maintenance, First Cut's diverse product portfolio addresses the full spectrum of agricultural applications. The company's reputation for local knowledge and manufacturing, quality, innovation and customer responsiveness has helped it become a trusted name in workshops, co-operatives, and production facilities across the country. ""When people think of First Cut in agriculture, they often assume we only offer meat-cutting band saw blades,"" says Stuart Beck, Sales Director at First Cut. ""But that is just the tip of the iceberg. In reality, band saw blades account for around 15% of what we supply into the agri sector. Our offering spans everything from welding electrodes and abrasives to pruning shears, clamps, measuring equipment, and heavy-duty hand tools. We serve every aspect of the sector, from the co-operative ('co-op') counter to the abattoir floor."" Serving meat processing with precision and safety In meat processing environments, First Cut's expertise and experience are particularly valuable. The company supplies a wide range of blades and tools tailored to specific applications, from carcass splitting and skinning to fine de-rinding of pork, or delicate de-skinning of salmon and tuna. ""Efficiency and hygiene are critical in meat processing,"" explains Beck. ""We design our blades to balance speed with minimal waste. That means tighter cuts, less dust and more product yield. For instance, our de-rinding blades are engineered with multiple angles so the operator can remove exactly the amount of fat they want: no more, and no less."" The company's blades are treated with food-safe oils and certified to comply with international hygiene standards, including those set by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture). First Cut's welding products also meet strict safety requirements for food-grade machinery repair, ensuring operators can maintain high sanitation standards in production. ""Product safety is fundamental to us,"" adds CEO Ian McCrystal. ""We do not compromise on the quality or traceability of our equipment. All of our blades are traceable through our ISO systems, giving customers peace of mind that they meet stringent global standards."" Tools for every agri application Beyond meat processing, First Cut supplies tools to support a wide range of agricultural maintenance and production tasks. Whether it is welding repairs on implements and trailers, building or mending fences - or undertaking precision fabrication - First Cut provides the industrial-grade tools which farmers rely on daily. ""Our range is broad, because our customers are multi-faceted,"" Beck says. ""A single farm might have its own abattoir, conduct equipment repairs, build fences and run small-scale manufacturing. We supply solutions for all of those needs."" First Cut's equipment is designed for professionals and includes high-performance hacksaw blades and ergonomic knife handles designed to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel in heavy use environments. ""We are not a DIY brand,"" McCrystal clarifies. ""Our tools are built for production. The fact that some households or smaller operators also use them speaks to their reliability, but our design principles are rooted in industrial applications, and industrial-grade performance."" Tailored for the sector, evolving with the industry Product development is shaped by customer requirements and grounded in deep technical expertise. ""We analyse every new agri-related application - whether it is processing livestock, welding machinery or cutting steel for construction such as farm warehouses - and align our offering accordingly,"" says Beck. With decades of experience in manufacturing and sourcing tools for demanding sectors, First Cut continues to grow its agricultural offering in step with the needs of South African farmers, co-ops and agri-processors. ""We are proud to support the agri sector,"" says McCrystal. ""Farmers today are more self-sufficient than ever. They need robust tools they can depend on, and that is what First Cut delivers,"" he concludes.",Farmers Review Africa,2025-10-01T06:01:52Z,https://farmersreviewafrica.com/first-cut-provides-a-total-cutting-welding-and-grinding-solution-for-dynamic-sa-agri-sector-challenges/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.298852,0.1058823529411765

Austria Inflation Eases To 4.0%,"BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - Austria's consumer price inflation eased slightly in September after accelerating to a 17-month high in August, a flash estimate from Statistics Austria showed on Wednesday. The consumer price index climbed 4.0 percent year-over-year in September, slower than the 4.1 percent increase in August, which was the highest inflation rate since March 2024. Nonetheless, the inflation rate is well above the European Central Bank's stability target of 2.0 percent. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by a 7.9 percent rise in energy costs and 4.7 percent higher costs for services. Prices for food, tobacco, and alcohol grew 3.8 percent from last year. On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped 0.2 percent. The EU measure of the harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, also rose at a slower rate of 3.9 percent versus a 4.1 percent increase in August. Monthly, the HICP increased 0.3 percent.

"Fall harvest is busiest, most dangerous time for rural Wisconsin drivers, farmers. Here's why","Autumn signals many changes in rural Wisconsin: cooler temperatures, shorter daylight hours and an uptick in farm machinery traffic as farmers harvest this year's crops and prepare fields for winter. As large pieces of farm equipment move in and out of fields, motorists may find themselves following slow-moving agricultural machinery as it bounces down the road, heading from one field to another. Wisconsin Farm Bureau President Brad Olson says fall harvest time can be one of the busiest and most dangerous seasons of the year for those involved in agriculture. ""All motorists share the goal of returning home safe to their families,"" Olson said. ""During this time of year, it is important to take extra precautions and pay careful attention to increased hazards on rural roadways."" Roadway crashes are the leading cause of injuries and death in agriculture. Last year, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation reported 153 crashes involving farm vehicles. Speed and inattentive driving are often cited as the cause of crashes between farm machinery and drivers. A 20-year-old Coloma woman narrowly avoided becoming a fatality last fall when she collided with a potato harvester being towed by a tractor on I-39 in Portage County. According to police reports, Hannah Borud was traveling at 75 mph around 1 p.m. when she attempted to swerve before striking the machinery. The driver of the tractor was traveling at 26 mph at the time of impact. Borud, who was injured, said she never saw the equipment. During a recent presentation he gave for National Farm Safety & Health Week, John Shutske, agricultural safety and health specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison says crashes between vehicles and farm equipment can happen in only a matter of seconds. The difference in speeds between a vehicle traveling at highway speeds following a tractor pulling two 250-bushel gravity boxes moving 18 mph doesn't give the driver much time to react. ""The SUV is approaching the back of a 27-ton train at a ""relative"" speed of 54.3 feet per second. In this ideal case, we have 600 feet/54.3 ft. per second or around 11 seconds (to react and take action),"" Shutske says. ""If I glance at a text, I burn up 200 feet."" Add in factors that limit visibility, such as curves and hills, or environmental factors like rain, fog and glare from the rising or setting sun, and the time to avoid a serious crash has nearly disappeared. The Polk County Sheriff's Office received a call at 5:18 a.m. on Sept. 25, 2024, of a crash on State 63 near Clear Lake involving an SUV and a farm tractor. Traveling in dense fog, the SUV driver died after hitting the back of the tractor. Most motorists are unaware of the physics involved in stopping a tractor pulling a loaded grain cart that can weigh upwards of 50,000 pounds. Although the machinery is moving at slower speeds, it requires a greater stopping distance. Since 2014, it has been illegal to pass farm equipment in a no-passing zone, regardless of speed. Motorists must wait until they enter a legal passing zone and can safely pass. Wide equipment operators are required by law to yield the opposite lane to oncoming traffic to maintain traffic flow and safety. Even if a motorist can legally pass a large piece of equipment within a very short distance of a controlled intersection, the action itself has a dramatic impact on the reaction time of the farm equipment operator, according to WFBF. Required lighting for farm machinery built since 2017 is based on the voluntary ANSI/ASAE S279 standard, which was adopted by the federal government and applies to tractors, self-propelled equipment, and implements; this lighting includes headlights and taillights, flashing amber lights, reflectors, and side-marking tape. Shutske says older equipment should be upgraded and encourages farmers to use inexpensive lighting kits that can be affixed with clamps or magnets. Side marking tape also increases visibility. Wisconsin has lighting and marking requirements for all Implements of Husbandry (IoH). Self-propelled IoH and farm equipment exceeding 12 feet wide or that extend over the center of the roadway have specific lighting and marking requirements. This is to ensure the safety of IoH operators and other traffic on the road. As farming operations expand and require more land to grow crops and spread manure, the equipment must also travel longer distances during harvest. Motorists may encounter a steady stream of large self-unloading forage wagons as well as manure tankers. Some tankers may spread manure directly on the fields, while other farmers may set up dump transfer stations along the road to provide manure for a dragline system. Drivers should pay special attention to manure tankers traveling to and from the site. ""Farmers and motorists share the responsibility of ensuring roadway safety. Attentiveness is a constant requirement on the road, but being prepared and exercising caution during peak times is vital to a successful harvest,"" Olson said. ""At the end of a long, hard workday, everyone deserves to return home safely.""",Yahoo,2025-10-01T10:02:34Z,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fall-harvest-busiest-most-dangerous-100234580.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.301056,-0.08235294117647063

JP Morgan personal investing brand set to launch in the UK in November,"JPMorganChase is set to revamp its investments offering in the UK this autumn, with plans to further ramp up competition in the market with the launch of a new DIY investment service next year. Wealth management and investment business JP Morgan Personal Investing will replace the firm's digital wealth manager Nutmeg, and will be available as a standalone offering as well as via the Chase UK app, the US-based financial services firm said. The launch will take place in November and the Nutmeg brand, which launched in 2012 and manages investments on behalf of more than 265,000 investors will be ""retired"". Nutmeg was acquired by JPMorganChase in 2021. Customers will see their Nutmeg app and website dashboard transition to the new JP Morgan Personal Investing brand and those who bank with Chase UK will continue to be able to access to their investments alongside their current account, credit card spending and savings pots, the firm said. In addition to managed investments, pensions, and Isas, there will be new products and services, including digital financial planning tools and dedicated ""relationship managers"". Clients with more than £250,000 invested with JP Morgan Personal Investing will have access to a dedicated relationship manager, aligned to their account to provide a personalised one-to-one experience and professional expertise. The firm said relationship managers will complement existing free financial guidance available to all customers and the paid-for restricted advice service currently offered. The value of investments can go down as well as up. In the coming weeks, customers will also have access to a new ""wealth planner"" feature, with tailored suggestions for moving closer to their goals. Further additions to products and services are expected in the year ahead, the firm said. In 2026, it is planning a new DIY investment platform, with more details set to be disclosed closer to the launch. Mark O'Donovan, chief executive of international consumer banking at JPMorganChase, said: ""JP Morgan Personal Investing will give retail customers in the UK the ability to bank with Chase and invest with JP Morgan."" Existing Nutmeg customers will be emailed about the changes and from November 3 they will see that their app and online dashboard have been updated, the firm said. Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said it is ""always positive"" to see increased competition in the investment sector, adding: ""Investing might seem a chore, but the rise of digital apps can make it easier to manage a portfolio, but whether a 'DIY' approach is suitable for an individual will depend on their circumstances, so seeking advice is wise before making any quick decisions.""",Yahoo!

"Popular Analyst Predicts Ethereum Price Will Rally 400% To $21,000, Here's When","Prominent crypto analyst PlanD has outlined a bold outlook for the Ethereum price, suggesting the asset may climb as much as 400% before the end of the year. The analysis indicates that the Ethereum price is breaking out of a four-year symmetrical triangle. This is a move often seen as a precursor to major Ethereum price rallies. The Ethereum price is currently consolidating around the $3,900 support zone. PlanD argues that this range represents the ""bottom"" of the current correction phase, laying the groundwork for the next upward leg in the Ethereum price. Should Ethereum Price push through that barrier, the analyst said it could hit a larger target of $21,000. While this projection could be one of the most dramatic Ethereum price rallies, a new DeFi platform, Paydax Protocol (PDP), is offering a more bullish proposition due to its utility and the problems it solves. Crypto investors often face the dilemma of accessing liquidity without losing their hard-earned assets. This is where Paydax Protocol (PDP) takes a different approach. Instead of forcing liquidation, the platform allows users to borrow stablecoins against their tokens, freeing up capital for new ventures. This is also while keeping their long-term gains intact. What makes the system more compelling is the safety net built beneath it. With multi-signature custody, redundant oracles, volatility buffers, emergency stop functions, and an Assure DeFi audit, Paydax Protocol has crafted a framework resilient enough to reassure both retail and institutional players. In conventional DeFi lending, interest rates fluctuate constantly in response to supply and demand dynamics. One day, you may be borrowing at 3%, and the next, it could skyrocket to 18%. This unpredictability can be a significant concern for cautious investors or institutions seeking stable cash flows. On the other hand, Paydax Protocol offers fixed APRs ranging from 5% to 7%, which is relatively uncommon in the DeFi arena. This structure allows borrowers to plan with assurance. When borrowing against BTC, ETH, XRP, or even tokenized gold, the upfront costs are transparent and clear. For lenders, this reliability is also beneficial. Fixed rates create steady returns, and through the Paydax Protocol's (PDP) peer-to-peer model, lenders can achieve yields up to 15.2% APY. This significantly outperforms traditional banks, where savings accounts typically yield less than 1%. Paydax Protocol (PDP) is already experiencing significant growth in its presale, drawing substantial interest from early investors. Within a week, over 20% of tokens were purchased. This resulted in over $722,000 raised. Presale experts suggest that at this rate, the first stage could sell out in the coming days. One of the driving forces behind this momentum is the PDP token staking model. Investors are incentivized to lock their tokens, earn yields, and unlock exclusive benefits, while also supporting the protocol's borrowing features. Unlike projects that rely on hype, the PDP token is built with real functionality into its ecosystem. This essentially implies the DeFi platform could see broad adoption, signalling long-term growth potential. While conventional banking solutions offer little to no solution to investor challenges, the Paydax Protocol employs a unique strategy by transforming tokens into functional assets that actively generate value through staking, lending, and borrowing. With the PDP token currently priced at $0.015, early adopters have an opportunity to stake their claim in a system built for sustainable growth and genuine utility. This presents an opportunity for the token to move beyond mere speculation and invest in a protocol that truly delivers results, ensuring that each token retains its value over time. By using the promo code PD80BONUS, investors can unlock an 80% bonus in tokens, offering a rare opportunity to partake in the next significant venture.

Tesco's corporate control has help raise average food prices by 37%,"In the past five years, UK food prices have gone up by 37% under the neoliberal system. Over the same period, Tesco's operating profit has skyrocketed from £1.8bn in 2020/21 to £3.1bn in 2024/25, an increase of 72%. And yet we have people flocking to Nigel Farage to tackle their woes. That's while he has announced zero policies on the cost of living. In fact, he'd likely make it worse through his policy to scrap climate change targets. Climate change is another key factor that drives up food prices, particularly imports from countries in the global south experiencing droughts. Historically, famines have occurred in the name of socialism and because of capitalism. The British believed that the free market should solve people's food shortages in India and Ireland, leading to the death of around one fifth of the Irish population in the 19th Century. In India, capitalists used the lack of supply to increase prices elsewhere from where famine raged, making more profit rather than relieving starving people. This reflected a lack of a modern welfare system - a left wing hallmark. In Soviet Russia, Stalin oversaw the Ukrainian famine - the Holdamoor, through overworking people and via a desire to crush Ukrainian nationalism. This is often used as an argument against any kind of collectivisation of the food supply. But what's clear is supermarkets like Tesco are wealth extracting middle men between people and farms. Arguably, the farms themselves should be left to some form of market forces to ensure reasonable profitability for the hard work of meeting demand. Recent figures suggest most farms in England are family-run. But the idea we should rent our food from corporations like Tesco is another matter. Farmers already work with middlemen retailers and buyers to try and ensure production meets demand. There's no reason such organisation cannot be done in-house, rather than via the obscene profits of Tesco. That said, farms waste 3.6 million tonnes of food every year according to WRAP, because of insufficiencies in the organisation between themselves and supermarkets. It's obvious that Farage has no solutions to the waste and extraction inherent to the neoliberal system of austerity, privatisation and deregulation. He only scapegoats foreigners for these issues. We need a systemic rethink.",The Canary,2025-10-01T10:01:18Z,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/10/01/tesco-food-prices/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.302785,-0.07450980392156858
OKO Raises Funding To Expand Climate Insurance For African Farmers,"OKO, a climate-tech and agritech startup providing climate insurance to African farmers, has raised a six-digit funding round led by Catalyst Fund, with support from existing investors. Founded in 2017 by Simon Schwall, the company leverages satellite data and mobile technology to deliver affordable crop insurance, helping smallholders and agribusinesses withstand climate shocks. Already operating in Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Uganda, Mozambique, and Angola, OKO has insured more than 33,000 farmers while executing all validated claims -- building trust across its networks.

The Fed Cut Rates -- Invest More or Wait It Out?,"The Federal Reserve Board made a small, quarter percent cut to the interest rate this week but signaled more cuts may be coming. Rate cuts can be good for taking on loans, but a mixed bag for investments. Christopher Stroup, a CFP and owner of Silicon Beach Financial, explained what this and future cuts might mean for your investments -- time to dig in deeper or hold steady? Lower rates usually mean weaker returns on savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), but stronger stock market performance as borrowing gets cheaper, Stroup explained. Bond values can also rise when yields fall. ""For everyday investors, the shift often feels like less income from cash but more growth opportunities in equities."" Stocks, especially growth and tech, often benefit from cheaper borrowing, as well, he noted. Real estate can also gain traction. On the other hand, cash-like investments such as CDs and savings accounts become less attractive, and newly issued bonds may offer lower yields than existing ones. Almost all financial advisors, Stroup included, will tell you that timing the market is nearly impossible, and consistent investing usually beats waiting. ""[D]ollar-cost averaging spreads risk and keeps your money compounding,"" Stroup said. In other words, by investing regularly you stay disciplined, avoid emotional decisions and position yourself to benefit whether markets rise or pull back. While it's natural to read news of a rate cut and think it means you should make an immediate move, Stroup said, ""The most common misstep is trying to trade on headlines by buying or selling too fast. Short-term moves rarely align with long-term goals."" These moves can lead to overreactions which ""can leave investors underexposed to growth opportunities or locked into lower-yielding assets unnecessarily."" There's one area where your money will immediately decline after a rate cut -- and that's in any high-yield type of savings or money market accounts. Your ""safe money"" earns less interest, he said. While these accounts remain useful for emergency funds, they're less effective for long-term growth anyway, so it could be smart to ""balance safety with higher-return opportunities elsewhere,"" Stroup said. No matter what,a balanced approach works best. ""Keep enough in cash or short-term bonds for stability but consider dividend-paying stocks or high-quality bonds for income,"" he said. The key is preserving principal while ensuring your portfolio generates steady, sustainable returns. Lower rates typically mean cheaper mortgages and auto loans, but credit card rates don't always fall as much, so don't hold onto debt just because you think it will cost you less. ""For investors, reduced borrowing costs can fuel corporate growth, which supports stock performance,"" Stroup said, another reminder that debt and investment strategies are connected. Don't forget that rate cuts often signal slowing growth, Stroup noted. However, don't panic, diversify. Also, shore up emergency savings and review your risk tolerance. ""A well-built portfolio can weather economic soft spots while still capturing long-term opportunities."" A rate cut can also stoke inflation by boosting demand, an unwelcome event in a time when every day costs are already high. So, ""investors should factor this into planning, focusing on assets like equities and real estate that historically outpace inflation over time."" Younger investors benefit from time, not timing, Stroup noted. While rate cuts can lift stocks, even if markets dip, decades of compounding will smooth out any volatility. ""Regular investing now creates the foundation for long-term wealth growth.""",GOBankingRates,2025-10-01T09:55:00Z,https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/strategy/feds-latest-rate-cut-should-you-invest-more-or-wait-it-out/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.303544,0.2705882352941176
"Contributor: Charging $100,000 for H-1B visas will cost the U.S. uncountable wealth","This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. President Trump signed a proclamation that imposes a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, the immigration allocation set aside for highly skilled workers the U.S. economy needs. The new rules threaten the availability and deployment of human capital in the United States. This is misguided and will hurt U.S. growth and innovation, at a time when the global arms race for AI creates a vital need for the sharpest human talent and innovators. We are professors who study and teach innovation-related topics at U.S. research universities. As immigrants to the United States from India and Panama respectively, we understand firsthand the sometimes painful discussions around H-1B immigration. Tensions around immigration routinely affect our academic institutions, our current students and former students now in industry. But there should be a lot of common ground on this polarizing topic. STEM immigrants are creating substantial value in the United States. Immigrants play a significant role in entrepreneurial ventures in the United States and particularly startup innovation. Further, such immigrants are responsible for 23% of innovation output in the United States. This effect is in part based on policies that allow for foreign students to study and stay in the United States to work in startups. H-1B immigration is like a natural selection process that benefits the U.S. immensely. Highly skilled immigrants in areas such as technology and medicine come hungry for hard work and full of ideas to better the world -- to create new products, services and even markets as well as to cater to existing needs through more incremental improvement and optimization. Many of our best students are immigrants who are looking to stay in the United States and create work opportunities that would not be possible anywhere else in the world. In the United States, we recognize entrepreneurial success perhaps more than any other country. It is one of our greatest attributes as a society. Nevertheless, we do have an immigration problem in the United States. The problem is that the distribution of benefits across the United States is highly skewed. Much of the wealth generated in terms of company creation and jobs has redounded to innovative clusters. But the idea to reduce the total number of H-1B immigrants by increasing the cost is exactly the wrong way to ""solve"" this problem -- by dragging down the thriving parts of the economy rather than lifting up the rest. To grow economic prosperity throughout the country, we need to offer more opportunities for more H-1B visa applicants. There are simply not enough trained U.S. nationals to take on the sort of labor required for the next wave of a tech-enabled industrial revolution. Distributing the fruits of H-1B visa holders' work more broadly requires a different approach than the U.S. has taken before. We should increase the total number of new H-1B visa recipients each year to 350,000 from around 85,000, with the additional visas apportioned across states so that locations like college towns -- places like Lawrence, Kan., Gainesville, Fla., and Clemson, S.C., as well as cities such as Birmingham, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Boise receive sufficient numbers of H-1B workers. Visas could be allocated through a process akin to the resident-matching system for medical doctors, thereby sending workers to states where they would create greater value by filling economic and technological gaps. This infusion of labor would improve technological innovation in local economies and create local spillover effects in job creation and additional innovation. Such immigration is necessary particularly now given a global push toward increased industrial policy, as China and others invest in AI and broader digital transformation. At a time when our national security is linked to technological innovation, it is shortsighted not to open ourselves to more immigration. If we do not, we will lose some of the best and brightest minds to Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore and other countries. Immigration is currently a volatile political issue in the U.S., as it has been at some other moments in the nation's history. Although this is a country of immigrants, for people who feel insecure about pocketbook and cultural issues, continued immigration can feel threatening. As a percentage of people living in the United States, it has been more than 100 years since there were as many immigrants here as there are now. But as with past waves of immigration, productivity and transformation have followed. This is particularly clear for H-1B visa holders, who create opportunities for people born in the U.S. and ensure the vitality of American innovation, security and democratic values. Increasing the costs of such visas would chill their use and reduce U.S. prosperity and innovation exactly at a time of great need.",Los Angeles Times,2025-10-01T10:07:00Z,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-10-01/h1b-visas-innovation-economy,2025-10-01 18:30:10.304223,0.1764705882352942
Startup founder sentenced to 7 years in US fraud case | THE DAILY TRIBUNE | KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN,"TDT | Manama Email: mail@newsofbahrain.com Startup founder sentenced to 7 years in US fraud case New York, United States A federal judge sentenced former tech start-up highflier Charlie Javice to just over seven years in prison on Monday after she was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase on a $175 million deal. Javice, who in 2021 sold her online business Frank to the US banking giant, was found guilty by a New York jury in March of charges the enterprise was built on millions of fabricated users. US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein sentenced Javice to 85 months in prison, a Department of Justice spokesman said. In their complaint, US prosecutors said Javice hired an outside data scientist to create a ""synthetic data set"" after a company engineer declined a request, citing concerns about illegality. Javice had billed Frank as offering a way to simplify the process of filling out the US application for financial aid for higher education. JPMorgan was drawn to the platform as a means to market banking services to younger consumers. Javice perpetrated ""an audacious and multifaceted criminal scheme"" that was ""fueled by greed,"" said Micah Festa Fergenson of the US Attorney's office, which had sought a 12- year sentence. While the case showed ""very poor"" due diligence on the part of JPMorgan, Judge Hellerstein said Javice's conduct merited punishment.",DT News,2025-10-01T10:12:35Z,https://www.newsofbahrain.com/business/119794.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.304418,-0.2784313725490196
What You Need to Know About Annuities,"Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Recommended Videos Q: How do income annuities work, and how they are different from investing in something that pays out income like bonds? A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end. Q: How can these types of annuities help with retirement planning? A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household's basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses -- housing, taxes, healthcare -- total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That's an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it. Q: Savings annuities, or ""deferred annuities,"" allow investors to get market exposure in addition to income. What are some key savings annuity types? A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you're in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular ""fixed index"" annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. Q: These products are more complicated than income annuities, and they carry more risk and higher costs. How can investors make sure they know what they're getting into with these products? A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. Q: What are the tax implications of annuities? A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Binance Launches Crypto-As-A-Service (CaaS) Bridging TradFi and Crypto - Tekedia,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, announced the launch of Crypto-as-a-Service (CaaS), a white-label infrastructure solution aimed at enabling traditional financial institutions (TradFi) like banks, brokerages, and stock exchanges to quickly integrate crypto trading services for their clients. This move positions Binance as a key infrastructure provider, allowing institutions to leverage its backend without building costly in-house systems, amid surging client demand for digital assets. CaaS provides a turnkey platform with the following core components: Access to Binance's spot and futures markets, plus internalized trading where institutions can match client orders internally for better pricing and revenue retention, with fallback to Binance's global liquidity pools. CaaS is secure, compliant storage and settlement tools tailored to regulatory needs across jurisdictions. Built-in KYC/AML, risk management, and reporting to help institutions meet local regulations while offering branded crypto services. Institutions can rebrand the service as their own, routing orders through their systems for a seamless user experience. Maximizes revenue by matching orders in-house CaaS starts from September 30, 2025, for select licensed banks, brokerages, and exchanges, including private demos and direct support from Binance's institutional team. Broade rollout is planned for later in Q4 2025, expanding to more qualified global institutions. Binance's Head of VIP & Institutional, Catherine Chen, emphasized: The demand for digital assets is growing faster than ever, and traditional financial institutions can no longer afford to be on the sidelines. However, building crypto capabilities from scratch is complex, costly, and can be risky. That's why we created Crypto-as-a-Service -- a turn-key solution that provides institutions with trusted, ready-made infrastructure. This launch follows Coinbase's similar offering in June 2025, intensifying competition to onboard TradFi players into crypto. Analysts see it as a bullish signal for mainstream adoption, potentially accelerating tokenization and hybrid financial products. BNB's price saw an uptick post-announcement, reflecting market optimism. CaaS could lower barriers for institutions, driving wider crypto accessibility while boosting Binance's ecosystem revenue through infrastructure fees. CaaS lowers the technical and regulatory barriers for TradFi institutions to offer crypto trading, custody, and settlement services. This could lead to a wave of banks and brokerages integrating crypto, meeting growing client demand for digital assets. Institutions can avoid the high costs and risks of building in-house crypto infrastructure, making entry faster and more cost-effective. Internalized trading allows institutions to retain more revenue by matching client orders in-house, with Binance's liquidity as a fallback. Offering branded crypto services could attract new clients and increase engagement with existing ones, especially younger, crypto-savvy investors. CaaS's built-in KYC/AML and risk management tools help institutions navigate complex regulatory landscapes, reducing compliance risks across jurisdictions. This could encourage more conservative institutions to enter the crypto space, particularly in regions with stringent regulations. By positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider, Binance diversifies its revenue beyond trading fees, capturing income from institutional service fees. Competing directly with Coinbase's similar offering, Binance reinforces its dominance in the crypto exchange market. Increased institutional adoption through CaaS could drive higher trading volumes on Binance's platform, boosting liquidity and potentially supporting BNB's price. The service may accelerate the development of hybrid financial products, like tokenized assets, as TradFi integrates with DeFi. Binance's entry into the white-label space intensifies competition with other exchanges and custody providers, potentially driving innovation and better pricing for institutions. As more banks and brokerages adopt CaaS, retail investors will gain easier access to crypto through familiar platforms, potentially driving mainstream adoption. This could lead to higher market participation, increasing demand for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional entry via CaaS could bring more stable capital flows and reduce volatility in crypto markets, as TradFi clients typically have larger, longer-term investments. Access to Binance's deep liquidity pools ensures better pricing and execution for end-users. Centralization concerns may arise, as Binance's infrastructure dominance could give it significant control over institutional crypto flows. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as more TradFi players enter crypto, potentially leading to tighter rules that affect retail investors. CaaS could accelerate the convergence of traditional finance and decentralized finance, fostering hybrid products like tokenized securities or crypto-backed ETFs. This may spur innovation in financial services, such as real-time settlement or programmable assets. While CaaS includes compliance tools, evolving global regulations could complicate adoption or impose new costs. Institutions relying on Binance's infrastructure may face risks if the exchange encounters legal or operational issues, given its past regulatory challenges. Binance's CaaS could be a game-changer, accelerating crypto's integration into mainstream finance by enabling TradFi institutions to offer crypto services efficiently. It strengthens Binance's ecosystem, boosts market liquidity, and enhances accessibility for retail investors.",Tekedia,2025-10-01T10:12:14Z,https://www.tekedia.com/binance-launches-crypto-as-a-service-caas-bridging-tradfi-and-crypto/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.306179,0.2313725490196079
A Positive Partnership: SC Shavings and the SC State Fair,"S.C. Shavings provides shavings for livestock and other animals at the South Carolina State Fair. Kristine Staples has held many job titles but calls her current one her favorite. Working in marketing and public relations across the country brought her to Aiken, South Carolina, where, for the past seven years, she and her family have run S.C. Shavings, a sawmill that makes shavings for horses and other livestock. Shavings are a crucial part of running any barn. They absorb unwanted moisture, help keep the space clean and dry, and provide what is essentially bedding for the horses and other animals. The value of their work is further emphasized when they take on providing shavings for all livestock at the S.C. State Fair every October. Prior to this endeavor, Staples and her husband, Drew, had been living abroad in England, where he was stationed with the U.S. Army. When they returned stateside, they decided to change their lives. ""My father-in-law knew my husband and I were talking about retiring from the Army. He called us and said, 'Let's buy a company. Let's do something fun and buy a company. Let's buy a sawmill.' And we thought, 'How hard could this be?'"" Staples said. Staples and her husband have always been animal people, so the idea that they could create and perfect a product for animals appealed to them immediately, and they dedicated themselves to that work. S.C. Shavings prides itself in knowing exactly where everything that goes into their product comes from, down to the logs. ""We know where our logs are coming from. They're all coming from South Carolina, straight yellow pine, and I know who the logger is. It comes onto our plant, my guys touch it, we shave it down, we put it through a dryer, and I see it come out of the dryer. I see it go through our screen to get the dust off. I watch it go into a bag, and I watch it leave,"" Staples said. In 2018, Staples decided she wanted to start doing more with her company and more for the community, so she became one of the South Carolina State Fair's partners. ""I said to my husband, 'We have to go to the fair,' and he said, 'We can't afford it. I've run the numbers, and it isn't something I think we can do right now.' And I said, 'We're not going to a no mindset; first we're going to yes,'"" Staples said. For Staples, it was never about the money; it was about being involved in something much bigger and helping the agriculture community. What began as a simple inquiry turned into a lasting partnership -- and the business owner still remembers the instant welcome she received from Nancy Smith, general manager of the South Carolina State Fair. ""I came in and sat down, and I felt like I had known Nancy all of my life. I went into the meeting with my child, and Nancy just embraced us,"" Staples said. ""They were looking for a shavings partner that could help alleviate their budget, but at the same time, could create a good partnership and a marketing platform and that human connection. And we said, 'Well, let's see what we can do,'"" Staples said. Along with making sure all livestock at the fair -- from horses to cattle -- are bedded comfortably, S.C. Shavings also sells shavings at the fair at a discounted rate. After this relationship, business for S.C. Shavings began booming in the surrounding states, and the company even became the official sponsor of the University of South Carolina equestrian team. What started as S.C. Shavings providing a product for the fair turned into a yearly mission. The S.C. State Fair began displaying the company's banners in fair arenas along with bags of their products on site so that competitors and animal owners could easily access the shavings and purchase them at the fair. ""Because of the fair, and with Nancy's help, we are now known. People are looking for us on social media, they're looking for us on Facebook, and they're looking for us on our website. They're doing the research, and then they call us, and a lot of times they say, 'Hey, we saw your bag at the fair,'"" Staples said. ""The S.C. State Fair has done so much to help us grow our company that being a part of it is something I look forward to every year,"" Staples said. ""Even after seven years, through thick and thin, Kris has never wavered in her commitment to the fair,"" Smith said. ""After Hurricane Helene, her business was without power, blocked by fallen trees, and unable to operate -- yet she called me in tears, deeply worried about us because she might not be able to deliver the shavings she had promised. That kind of dedication, even in the face of personal and professional hardship, is extraordinary -- and it's why this partnership is still going strong."" ""We have a real relationship, and that's a good place to be. For me, what keeps me going every year is that this is a commitment that I've made,"" Staples said. ""It's a commitment that I've made to the fair and to the agricultural community that comes and shows at the fair. I'm not gonna let them down, and that's why we do it every year."" This agricultural community is one that Staples and her family value. Staples grew up with a deep love for animals and farming, which she has begun to instill in her own children by raising them on her family's land with ducks and horses. Being a part of the fair has allowed her to have even more of that in her life. ""You have these cowboys out and cowgirls out showing their horses and their cows and their pigs, and they've worked so hard on them. We didn't always have that lifestyle, but coming in now, I think I'm actually living out a childhood dream. I really enjoy being around these hospitable people and doing something for that next generation of kids coming up in agriculture."" We invite you to join us as a partner of the South Carolina State Fair! With 400,000 guests in just 12 days, the exposure is unmatched.

"Bitcoin Rebounds as Bulls Eye Breakout Toward $115,000 Amid Market Uncertainty - Tekedia","Bitcoin has regained momentum coming out of the weekend, showing resilience after a sharp pullback. The flagship cryptocurrency climbed back to $113,453 at the time of reporting, rebounding from a slump that took it down from a recent high of $114,743 to a low of $112,608. The recovery follows a deeper dip near $108,000, where Bitcoin staged a bounce that carried it above the $113,000 mark. Bulls are now working to reclaim the $115,000 level, although momentum has weakened as sellers push back. While the rebound eased immediate pressure, uncertainty remains as the market keeps a close watch on global macroeconomic risks. Despite the mixed signals, expectations of further gains are growing. Crypto analyst Arman Shabanndescribed Bitcoin's current trajectory as bullish, citing the formation of a clear ascending channel. According to his analysis, Bitcoin has been moving within this channel and recently bounced off strong support in the $108,000-$109,000 region. Shabann suggested that the market has now entered a natural correction phase, with the midline of the channel serving as the key level for determining the next move. If Bitcoin trends lower, a retest of support around $105,000 remains possible. Shabann argued that such a move would set up another rebound, offering an ideal entry point for traders. In a bullish scenario, holding the upper boundary of the channel could trigger a strong continuation of the uptrend, with the analyst projecting a rally of over 30% -- potentially lifting Bitcoin as high as $156,000. Conversely, a break below $105,000 would hand control back to the bears, exposing the psychological $100,000 region. Another voice in the market, top crypto analyst Maartunn, flagged a significant development on Bybit, where the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio surged to 24.26, the highest since September. This spike indicates an aggressive wave of long positions, a signal often associated with strong bullish intent. Bitcoin's market structure is ""just clean,"" said crypto analyst Matthew Hyland, referring to a double bottom in the daily time frame and a potential breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. ""Entering Q4 post halving where BTC has found cycle highs historically"". As Cointelegraph reported, BTC price may rally toward the $140,000 range next if the resistance between $112,000 and $114,000 is broken. The coming days will be pivotal as Bitcoin tests the $115,000 resistance zone. A decisive breakout could validate bullish positioning and pave the way toward $117,500, while failure to clear resistance may trigger profit-taking or liquidations, dragging prices back toward $110,000. A confirmed move above $117,500 would also break the current lower-high structure, potentially opening the path to retesting $120,000 and higher. For now, market sentiment leans bullish, particularly as Bitcoin appears set to close September in positive territory, up 4.5% around $113,100. Historically, a green September has often preceded strong year-end rallies, adding weight to optimistic projections for the months ahead. Despite Bitcoin price retracement and bullish price projection, risks still linger. The looming threat of a U.S. government shutdown is keeping traders cautious, as risk assets like Bitcoin tend to react sharply to political and fiscal uncertainty.",Tekedia,2025-10-01T10:12:14Z,https://www.tekedia.com/bitcoin-rebounds-as-bulls-eye-breakout-toward-115000-amid-market-uncertainty/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.307304,0.1058823529411765

Fortress co-CEO dies aged 51,"Josh Pack, the co-CEO and managing partner of Fortress Investment Group, which owns Majestic Wine, has died unexpectedly, at age 51. His death was announced by Fortress, which also counts Loungers ltd and Punch Pubs in its portfolio. Pack, who was also a board member of Majestic, spent more than 23 years at the US private equity firm, and was a ""devoted husband and father"", the company said in a statement. ""We are devastated by this loss. Joss was a gifted investor, a thoughtful strategist, a compassionate leader - and a deeply cherished friend to many,"" the statement added. A cause of death was not provided. Before joining Fortress, Pack served as a vice president at Wells Fargo, and had previously attended the United States Air Force Academy. Fortress, which is majority-owned by Abu Dhabi's Mubadala investment arm, was founded in 1998, and manages USD$53 billion worth of assets. Majestic Wine's commercial and retail business was sold to Fortress for £95 million in 2019. The sale included all but one of its stores, and its company's website, along with the commercial on-trade business, the French division, Les Celliers de Calais, and Majestic's HQ. A spokesman told db that after nearly forty years of trading, the Majestic name came ""closer than ever before"" to disappearing.

"Gold prices soar, where will the short positions go? for TVC:GOLD by Matthew_8888","Currently, gold is encountering resistance and falling back near 3893-3895, and the bullish momentum has weakened slightly. As mentioned earlier, the current price has reached our risk area. A large part of the reason for today's rise is that the US government has officially shut down. This kind of news-stimulated rise is not long-lasting. After encountering resistance, it will fall like a waterfall. The technical indicators have diverged and are overbought, and most funds cannot participate in long transactions in this extreme rising pattern. In order to increase liquidity, gold also needs a correction, so we consider continuing to short gold near 3893. To increase liquidity, gold also needs a pullback, so we are considering continuing to short gold around 3893.

"Warren Buffett's Favorite Indicator Hits 'Playing With Fire' Levels: What It Means - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)","The Warren Buffett Indicator, a key measure of the U.S. stock market's valuation, has reached a level that the legendary investor once cautioned was akin to ""playing with fire."" Warren Buffett Indicator Hits 217%, Signaling Overvalued Market The Warren Buffett Indicator, which compares the total U.S. stock market value to the size of the U.S. economy, has surpassed 200%, Fortune reported. This surge, driven by the rapid rise in market values compared to GDP, has pushed the ratio to around 217%, well above historical norms. The rise in the Warren Buffett Indicator coincides with an extended bull market driven by AI excitement, strong mega-cap performance, and elevated P/E ratios. As a result, the total value of U.S. stocks has climbed to around 363% of GDP, well above the 212% peak seen during the dot-com boom. JPMorgan's David Kelly told the publication that most gains since the mid-1980s come from rising profit shares and higher multiples, creating ""increasingly lofty"" foundations that may be unsustainable, reflecting broader critiques of U.S. financialization since the Reagan era. Highlighted Risk Of Weaker Future Returns Buffett introduced the indicator twenty years ago, describing it as ""probably the best single measure"" of overall market valuation at any given moment. The latest reading indicates that stock prices have outstripped the pace of economic growth, creating potential risks if earnings or expansion fail to keep up. Although the indicator has its limitations, surpassing the 200% level is uncommon and suggests that future returns could be weaker if valuations contract or growth decelerates, reflecting Buffett's emphasis on value and a margin of safety. AI slump, US Slowdown Raise Concerns Over Market Risks The AI boom is faltering, with GPT-5's launch disappointing and a summer selloff erasing $1 trillion, raising concerns that current market leaders may be overvalued. At the same time, U.S. growth is slowing, prompting strategists to recommend diversifying into international stocks, core bonds, and alternative assets. These developments are in line with the concerns raised by Goldman Sachs about potential market shocks that could disrupt the current 'Goldilocks' economy. The firm's chief global equity strategist, Mueller-Glissmann, identified three potential 'bears' that could disrupt this equilibrium, including a growth shock, a rate shock, and a new dollar bear. These concerns are also in line with the warnings raised by analysts, which highlighted the concentration of the S&P 500 in just ten companies, with the top three -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) controlling more market weight than the smallest 200 companies combined. This concentration could pose a risk to investors if the market experiences a significant shock. Price Action: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ), which track the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 index, surged 13.95% and 17.67%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Is it safe to travel to the Philippines?,"A 6.9-magnitude earthquake in the central Philippines has raised concerns about the safety of travel plans to Southeast Asia. The quake struck off the coast of Bogo City in Cebu province in the central Visayas just before 10pm local time on Tuesday (30 September). At least 69 people have died after the powerful earthquake collapsed homes, roads and power lines, said officials. Vice Governor Glenn Soco officially declared the entire province of Cebu, including Bogo, San Remigio, Tabuelan and Medellin, ""under a State of Calamity"" on Wednesday. As cities continue to be jolted by aftershocks, here is everything to know about travelling to or from the Philippines. : Philippines earthquake latest The Philippines sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", one of the most seismically active zones on Earth, and experiences around 826 earthquakes a year. The 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Bogo City in Cebu province in the central Visayas just before 10pm local time (2pm GMT) on Tuesday, toppling buildings, cutting power and damaging a century-old church. The tremor hit hardest in northern Cebu, including San Remigio, Tabuelan and Medellin. Cebu, one of the Philippines' most popular tourist regions with a population of 3.4 million, is also home to the country's second-busiest gateway, Mactan-Cebu International Airport. The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) says: ""On 30 September 2025, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck northern Cebu, with the epicentre near Bogo City. Local authorities have reported casualties, injuries, and significant damage to infrastructure. ""Power outages and disruptions to transport and communications have been reported. Aftershocks are expected and may continue over the coming days."" It advised British nationals in the Philippines to follow the advice of local authorities, be aware of aftershocks and avoid damaged buildings. Generally, the foreign office advises against all travel to parts of the Philippines, including Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. The FCDO encourages prospective travellers to Cebu and nearby provinces to contact their travel providers and check their travel insurance covers natural disasters. Government advice also suggests tourists stay informed via the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. According to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Mactan-Cebu International Airport and other aviation hubs in Visayas were not damaged during the earthquake. Passengers were evacuated from the Mactan-Cebu terminal at 10.40pm on Tuesday following the earthquake, but were later allowed to re-enter with the airport continuing ""normal operations"". As of 12am on Wednesday, a runway inspection was ongoing at Bacolod Airport. Calbayog Airport, Hilongos Airport, Maasin Airport, Ormoc Airport, and Tacloban Airport in Eastern Visayas, after inspection, ""did not incur damages as per initial inspection"", said CAAP. As the FCDO has not warned against non-essential travel to the Philippines, there will be no special circumstances in place to cancel a trip for a full refund. The conditions for cancelling your trip will be dependent on your holiday provider, so it's best to contact them if you're looking to postpone. There is no obligation for companies to refund bookings if you want to cancel, and you will not be able to claim on your travel insurance due to safety concerns unless government advice changes. Some travel insurance policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents you from reaching your holiday destination. Check your insurance policies and speak to your insurer to see where you stand.",The Independent,2025-10-01T10:00:58Z,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/philippines-is-it-safe-earthquake-advice-b2837082.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.309783,-0.02745098039215688

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra says UPI transactions to remain free of any charges,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who had earlier stated that UPI cannot remain free forever and that someone else is now paying for it, on Wednesday said the digital payment app will remain a zero-cost platform to encourage its wider adoption. ""Currently, we have no proposal to impose any charges on UPI transactions,"" Governor Malhotra said during the customary post-policy presser in response to a question from the press. Addressing concerns about possible charges on digital payments, he clarified that ""UPI will continue to remain free for users under present policy."" This comes against the government massively slashing the subsidy allocation in the budget by a whopping 78 per cent to a low of Rs 437 crore in FY26, down from Rs 2,000 crore in FY25 and Rs 3,631 crore in FY24. Malhotra's statement reinforces the government and the central bank's stance of keeping the most popular digital payment tool a zero-cost platform to encourage wider adoption of digital payments across the country. The statement comes at a time when UPI transactions continue to scale record highs, cementing the country's position as the world's largest real-time payments market. It also comes amid renewed speculation about the sustainability of UPI's zero-cost model.",The New Indian Express,2025-10-01T10:11:07Z,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2025/Oct/01/rbi-governor-sanjay-malhotra-says-upi-transactions-to-remain-free-of-any-charges,2025-10-01 18:30:10.310711,0.003921568627450966

Almost no one is building new apartments in Los Angeles. Here's why,"New apartments need $4,000-$5,000 monthly rents to break even, forcing residents to live farther from their jobs. Los Angeles developer Cliff Goldstein just completed a plush new apartment complex on the Westside, but that's the last one he's going to build for the foreseeable future. Even though demand for housing in the region is red hot, many people who build apartments for a living have paused putting shovels in the ground because, they say, it's just too hard to turn a profit. ""It's a needle in a haystack to find an opportunity that makes financial sense to build today,"" Goldstein said. Ari Kahan used to have multiple projects with as many as 800 total units being built in Los Angeles at any given time. No more, he says. ""We haven't bought a site with the intention to develop it in over two years,"" he said. ""I don't know when we will be building in L.A next."" The supply of fresh rental units, which make up the bulk of new housing in Los Angeles, is petering out despite robust demand. The vacancy rate is among the lowest in the country, while rental rates are among the highest nationwide. Still, the number of new units under construction in Los Angeles has been falling each quarter since early last year and is set to dive to a more than 10-year low, according to real estate data provider CoStar. Under 19,000 apartments were under construction in the three months through September. That's 30% fewer than three years earlier, according to CoStar's count. Developers say they can't raise the money they need to build as many of their biggest backers -- think pension funds, insurance companies and other institutions looking for long-term investments -- don't want to park their money in L.A. because the rapidly changing rules make it impossible to predict profits. The years since COVID-19 have demonstrated how tangled regulation of the industry can get in L.A., observers say, so investors are taking their money to other cities. ""L.A. has been redlined by the majority of the investment community,"" said Kahan, a principal of California Landmark Group. If the investors won't invest, builders can't build. ""A developer without investors would be like a king without clothes,"" said Goldstein. ""I am an optimistic developer who wants to develop, but the investment community won't participate."" Recent policy out of Washington also hasn't helped. Higher tariffs have sparked rising prices in construction materials and equipment, while the crackdown on undocumented workers has thinned and spooked much of the international workforce the industry depends on. ""Prices rose at an especially rapid pace in some of the categories most affected by tariffs,"" including iron and steel prices, which have risen 9% in the last year, and copper wire and cable prices, which have jumped 14%, said Anirban Basu, chief economist of trade group Associated Builders and Contractors. California's construction industry depends on immigrant workers. Around 61% of construction workers in the state are immigrants, and 26% of those are undocumented, according to a June report from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. ""Finding construction labor was hard before, and now it's even harder,"" economist Richard Green said. Green, who is director of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, said findings from a new USC project that collects housing data on Los Angeles County neighborhoods illustrate the problem. Housing production in Los Angeles County has slowed dramatically over the decades, dropping from over 70,000 new units annually in the 1950s to roughly 30,000 in the 1970s and 1980s to less than 15,000 in the 2010s. This long-term slowdown in housing construction has left the region with an older, more strained housing stock and a deep shortfall in affordable options, USC said. With little urban land left for single-family subdivisions, most new housing is rental apartments. Over the last six years, around 152,000 new units were built in Los Angeles County. The vast majority of those were rental units, and only 10% were affordable to lower-income households. Southern California stands out even among sharp nationwide declines in apartment production, according to HomeAbroad, which helps foreign investors buy U.S. real estate. The number of multifamily building permits issued in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area in July fell 68% to 556 compared to the same month in 2020, HomeAbroad said. It was the second biggest drop in the country after the Silicon Valley area of San José-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara. Among investors' concerns are public policies such as the United to House Los Angeles transfer tax on large real estate sales, and also temporary limits on evicting tenants that were enacted during the pandemic. ""They're fearful of what policies might come down later,"" said Goldstein, a co-founder of GPI Cos. On Tuesday, two Los Angeles City Council members introduced a motion to study the effects of establishing a $32.35 per hour minimum wage for construction projects in the city with 10 or more residential units that are under 85 feet in height. The study will also examine adding an additional healthcare credit of $7.65 per hour to builders' costs. Of course, the cost of apartments in Los Angeles is also hard on renters. At the current construction price, developers need to charge between $4,000 and $5,000 per month in rent, depending on the apartment size, which suggests the tenant should earn between $120,000 and $150,000 per year. Developers predict people will have to move farther out and commute times will grow. Still, some are looking for deals to be ready to build when the environment is better. ""There is a lot less competition and prices have come down substantially"" on some types of properties, said Jordan Lang, president of McCourt Partners. ""We're viewing this as a time to buy multiple land sites to be ready for this next cycle."" In Culver City, McCourt Partners has recently joined with Lincoln Property Co. to take over and redesign a proposed apartment complex on Jefferson Boulevard. Lang hopes to start work on the project next year, pending the return of institutional investors. ""We're anticipating capital coming back into the market"" in six months to three years, he said. ""We want to be ready with a project that can put shovels in the ground when that happens.""",Los Angeles Times,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-01/apartment-development-pipeline-dries-up-in-spite-of-demand-for-housing,2025-10-01 18:30:10.311796,0.0117647058823529
Vehicle destroyed by fire in car park at Heathrow Airport,"A car caught fire in a multi-storey car park at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it sent four fire engines and about 25 firefighters to the scene at Terminal 3. The vehicle was destroyed by the blaze and two adjacent vehicles were damaged. Heathrow said the car park was closed but has since reopened. The rest of the airport remained open as usual during the incident. LFB said it received the first report about the blaze at 9.04am, and the fire was under control by 10.06am. The cause of the fire is under investigation. A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""Earlier this morning our teams responded to a small vehicle fire in the multi-storey car park for Terminal 3. ""The fire was quickly extinguished. This is an isolated incident. We apologise to passengers for any inconvenience.""

New oil and gas reserves discovered in Sindh's Khairpur,"In another positive development in Pakistan's energy sector, the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) has reported a major discovery of oil and gas reserves in the Khairpur district of Sindh. In an official statement, the company revealed that initial estimates indicate a daily production capacity of 690 barrels of crude oil and 22.5 million standard cubic feet of gas (MMSCFD) from the newly drilled well. The discovery was made at the Bitrism East-1 site, operated by OGDCL under the Bitrism Exploration License, where it holds a 95% working interest. The remaining 5% is held by Government Holdings (Private) Limited (GHPL) as part of a joint venture. According to the statement, two Drill Stem Tests (DSTs) conducted at the well yielded promising results, with a combined output of 22.5 MMSCFD of gas and 690 barrels of condensate per day on a 32/64'' choke. OGDCL believes that this find will play a vital role in narrowing the energy supply-demand gap by tapping into local resources. It will also enhance the company's -- and the country's -- hydrocarbon reserves base.",MM NEWS,2025-10-01T10:07:58Z,https://mmnews.tv/new-oil-and-gas-reserves-discovered-in-sindhs-khairpur/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.312103,0.192156862745098
Gov. Newsom orders study of California's ailing utility and insurance markets,"An insurance group opposes limiting utility liability, calling it ""the worst safety incentive"" for companies whose equipment sparks blazes. Gov. Gavin Newsom called Tuesday for a report that will study whether to limit the liabilities of California's investor-owned utilities if they're found to have caused wildfires -- as well as to possibly establish a state-supported property insurance fund. The executive order is more broadly intended to come up with ideas on how to reduce the risk and better share the cost of wildfires -- as well as to shore up California's insurance market and investor-owned utilities -- following the devastation caused by the January Los Angeles blazes. ""There's no Republican or Democratic thermometer -- red and blue state alike, and countries around the world, are facing this climate-fueled insurance crisis. And California is taking action,"" Newsom said in a statement accompanying his order. The report was required by SB 254, a bill he recently signed to replenish the state's $21-billion wildfire fund following the fires. The bill would add $18 billion to the fund, split by contributions from utility customers and investors. The fund was established in 2019 to act as a financial backstop for Southern California Edison and the state's other investor-owned utilities amid the growing severity and frequency of wildfires, but there are fears it could be depleted by Altadena's Eaton blaze, which may cost insurers $15 billion. SB 254 called for a report that would recommend ""new models"" to mitigate damage, accelerate recovery and equitably ""allocate the burdens"" of wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters among homeowners, insurers, utilities and others, but it otherwise lacked specificity. Newsom's order requires the California Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Insurance and multiple other state agencies to produce the report by April that will focus on a few main areas. They include lessening fire risks through high-tech and other mitigation measures; ensuring the availability of insurance and affordable energy; assisting homeowners and communities recover from disasters and ensuring wildfire losses are promptly and fully paid. ""These are all familiar concepts that we've been discussing for months, and in some cases, years,"" said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, a trade group representing the state's large property and casualty insurers. However, he took aim at a provision that calls for studying the ""potential benefits and potential negative impacts"" on homeowners if there are restrictions placed on damages from lawsuits filed against electric or gas utilities found to have caused wildfires. ""We continue to argue that it's critical to have safety incentives for utilities, and letting them cause fires and not pay for them is the worst safety incentive there is,"" Frazier said. While an official cause of the Eaton fire has not been established, Edison has acknowledged its power lines may have played a role and the company has been sued by insurers, public entities and others seeking compensation. The study also will seek recommendations on how to hold ""electrical corporations accountable for improving safety and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires."" Frazier noted there was a push to limit utility wildfire liability after a series of devastating fires in 2017 and 2018 that ultimately forced Pacific Gas & Electric to file for bankruptcy. None of those made it into law. A 2019 law backed by Newsom significantly limited the liability that utilities have for catastrophic wildfires sparked by their equipment. Possible additional curbs on liabilities to be studied could include limits on attorney fees, and economic and non-economic damages due to claims by insurers and public entities, as well as those outside fire zones. Southern California Edison spokesperson Scott Johnson declined to comment on Frazier's criticism and said, ""We certainly thank Gov. Newsom for taking this important action, and we look forward to working with the respective state entities and stakeholders to develop meaningful and affordable solutions to address the increasing risks from climate-driven catastrophic events."" Other provisions in the order call for the report to study ""alternative structures to socialize risk of damage from natural catastrophes"" -- and to study ""new models"" to replace or compliment the wildfire fund such as ""state-supported property insurance, or reinsurance,"" as well as a ""publicly supported safety net to enhance long-term resilience and utility and insurance rate affordability."" Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a leading Los Angeles advocacy group, agreed with Newsom that it is important to consider some sort of public insurance option but was skeptical much would come of the effort. ""It's just a question of whether anything's going to get done, because he only has a year left in office,"" he said. Consumer Watchdog, he noted, worked on a bill that would have leveraged the state's credit rating to assist in lowering the cost of reinsurance, which is bought by insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic claims. However, it never got off the ground. Newsom said Tuesday in his news release that California has already made progress in reforming its insurance market following an executive order he issued in 2023 that supported Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's Sustainable Insurance Strategy. That strategy, which is just being implemented, has sought to entice insurers to write policies in fire-prone neighborhoods, but has been criticized by some consumer advocates as a giveaway to the insurance industry. Lara issued a statement Tuesday praising the governor's latest order. ""Our shared goal is to ensure that every Californian has peace of mind, knowing they can recover and rebuild after a disaster, regardless of their ZIP Code or income level,"" he said.",Los Angeles Times,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-01/governor-proposes-reforms-to-state-insurance-market,2025-10-01 18:30:10.312741,-0.0980392156862745
Deposit insurance: RBI proposes risk-based premium for banks,"NEW DELHI: The RBI has proposed a flat-rate to a Risk-Based Premium (RBP) framework, effective from the next financial year, under the Deposit Insurance scheme. This move marks a shift towards differentiating insurance costs based on the financial health and soundness of individual banks. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), which operates the deposit insurance scheme under the DICGC Act, 1961, has traditionally charged all banks a uniform premium, currently pegged at 12 paise per Rs 100 of assessable deposits. The RBI says while the existing flat-rate system is simple to administer, its major drawback is its inability to distinguish between banks based on their risk profile. Under the new RBP model, banks demonstrating greater financial stability and robustness will be rewarded with a significantly lower premium payout, fostering better risk management across the sector. A detailed notification outlining the parameters and implementation mechanism of the new Risk-Based Premium model will be issued shortly. Background of deposit insurance in India Under the Deposit Insurance scheme, each depositor in a bank is insured up to a maximum of Rs 5,00,000. This limit covers both the principal and accrued interest amount across all deposits (Savings, Fixed, Current, Recurring) held by the customer in the ""same right and same capacity"" at a single bank. The limit was substantially raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in February 2020. Deposit insurance in India is provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Established in 1962, the DICGC provides a critical safety net for the banking system, ensuring public confidence and protecting depositors against bank failures.",The New Indian Express,2025-10-01T10:09:09Z,https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2025/Oct/01/deposit-insurance-rbi-proposes-risk-based-premium-for-banks,2025-10-01 18:30:10.312955,0.1450980392156862

Solana Price Struggles as Crucial Holders' Sentiment Splits,"A break above $214 and $221 could lift SOL toward $232, but falling below $206 risks decline to $200 and bearish reversal. Solana (SOL) has been in an uptrend for more than three months, but recent selling pressure briefly disrupted momentum. The altcoin dipped before quickly recovering as investor support stabilized the market. Despite signs of strength, mixed sentiment among holders is creating uncertainty about Solana's near-term direction. On-chain data highlights growing bearishness among long-term holders (LTHs). Solana's Liveliness metric has spiked in recent weeks, signaling an increase in coins leaving dormant wallets. This behavior suggests LTHs are offloading assets, reducing conviction, and applying downward pressure on the altcoin's overall price action. For the past month, this trend has persisted. Although the rate of LTH selling slowed, it did not stop entirely. The consistent exits reflect caution among experienced investors and likely contributed to Solana's recent dip. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. Countering this pressure, short-term holders (STHs) are maturing. HODL Waves data shows that supply controlled by one to three-month holders has risen to 14.4%, its highest point in five months. This indicates growing confidence from newer market participants who are holding instead of selling into volatility. The maturing of STHs has been crucial in supporting Solana's uptrend. By choosing to hold through recent swings, these investors are offsetting the selling activity from LTHs. Solana is trading at $209, holding above the $206 support level and testing its uptrend line. The steady recovery highlights investor commitment to maintaining bullish momentum after brief interruptions caused by increased selling pressure from LTHs. The mildly bullish outlook could extend Solana's rally. If momentum holds, SOL could climb past $214 and $221 resistance levels. A push beyond those thresholds would open the path to $232, reinforcing optimism about further gains in the coming weeks. However, if selling pressure from long-term holders intensifies, Solana risks slipping below $206. A drop to $200 would invalidate the bullish thesis, signaling weakness and potentially sparking renewed bearish sentiment in the altcoin's market structure.",BeInCrypto,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://beincrypto.com/solana-faces-tug-of-war-will-price-suffer/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.313429,0.07450980392156858

[Executive Corner] Leading the Game: How LG Became Spain's #1 in Professional LED Technology at Sports Venues,"(BPT) - By Jaime de Jaraíz, president of LG Electronics Iberia When fans walk into a stadium, they expect more than just a game or a show -- they expect to feel part of something bigger. In Spain, this new era of immersive sports and entertainment has two shining examples: the Riyahd Air Metropolitano in Madrid and the Roig Arena in Valencia. At both venues, we at LG are helping write a new chapter in the digital transformation of sports, leading a technological revolution that redefines how every moment is experienced. What sets us apart is not only our leadership as the No. 1 provider of professional LED technology in Spain,* but also our ability to turn every project into a unique digital ecosystem. We don't just install screens -- we create living platforms where image, software and infrastructure work together to make every corner of a venue come alive. Riyahd Air Metropolitano: An Icon in Transformation In Madrid, our collaboration with Atlético de Madrid has transformed the Riyahd Air Metropolitano into a stadium that breathes innovation. The exterior and interior now form a dynamic canvas of light and color, amplifying the atmosphere of every moment. At the top, our state-of-the-art Mesh LED envelops the stadium in a 360-degree visual spectacle, amplifying the excitement of every goal and every play and making the roar of the fans even more powerful and unforgettable. Roig Arena: A New Global Benchmark In Valencia, the Roig Arena was envisioned as one of the most advanced arenas in the world. At the heart stands our technological gem: the high-resolution video scoreboard. This giant screen, bearing the LG seal of innovation, offers precise sharpness and color uniformity that allow every replay, every stat and every detail of the game to be seen with astonishing clarity throughout the stands. But it does much more than display scores -- it syncs with lighting, sound and dynamic content to turn every key moment into a cinematic experience. Around it, the perimeter LED ribbon and the iconic outdoor screen, The Eye, complete a digital ecosystem that extends the excitement beyond the venue, placing Valencia at the forefront of Europe as a venue for top-level competitions and events. Digitalization as a Driver of Change In both Madrid and Valencia, we're showing that digitalizing stadiums isn't just about impressive visuals -- it's about smarter management, new ways to communicate and deeper connections with audiences. These venues are flexible platforms that can adapt to matches, concerts, cultural shows or corporate events. And for sponsors, they open new doors to engage with the public in more personal, real-time ways. Shaping the Future Through Leadership In recent years, we've been proud to contribute to nearly thirty sports venues in Spain, from stadiums and arenas to the Rafa Nadal Academy and local gyms. With a 45% share of the professional LED market in Spain in the first quarter of 2025,* and the trust of eight out of 10 major Spanish stadiums, we are not just equipping venues -- we are redefining the live event experience. However, this leadership isn't built on technology alone. It comes from people -- the talent, passion and dedication of nearly 240 professionals at LG Spain.

Frozen feud: How Trump and the Supreme Court helped put historic Whole Foods union bid on ice,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) -On January 27, workers at a Philadelphia Whole Foods voted to become the first store in the Amazon-owned grocery chain to unionize. When the result was announced that night, produce worker Ed Dupree, who helped organize the monthslong campaign, ran to the produce cooler with his coworkers. Flanked by fresh celery, apples and broccoli, they shared hugs while some cried tears of joy, savoring a victory that showed Dupree that his employer was not, in his words, an ""invincible behemoth."" The celebratory mood quickly evaporated. Later that night in Washington, barely a week into Donald Trump's second term in office, the Republican U.S. president fired Gwynne Wilcox, a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board who he accused of disfavoring business interests. Suddenly the NLRB, a 90-year-old U.S. government agency that oversees private sector labor relations, had fewer than the minimum of three members needed to carry out its core functions such as resolving disputed union elections. Many companies have seized upon this paralysis as they fight labor campaigns, a Reuters review of NLRB filings showed. Since Wilcox's removal, employers have lodged at least 50 appeals with the NLRB challenging union elections to an agency that cannot resolve them, the Reuters review found, with the appeals coming at a highly vulnerable point in the union organizing process. In at least 22 appeals, companies have argued that elections cannot be certified while the board is shorthanded. ""Without a quorum, the Board cannot function as Congress intended,"" Wilcox said in an email to Reuters. ""The resulting delays and uncertainty unfairly burden workers seeking to exercise their rights to organize."" A week after Wilcox's firing, Whole Foods challenged the election outcome, arguing among other things that ""the NLRB has only two members"" and therefore the agency's regional offices lose their power to certify union elections. The U.S. Supreme Court in April and again in May let Trump's firing of Wilcox remain in effect while her legal challenge to her removal plays out, halting a federal judge's ruling that had briefly reinstated her. The independent board at full strength has five presidentially appointed members. Trump's firing of Wilcox brought it to two, below the minimum of three needed to decide cases. After another member's term expired, the board now has just a single member. When the NLRB will regain members depends on how quickly the Republican-led U.S. Senate moves to confirm two nominees picked by Trump in July, Boeing's chief labor counsel and an NLRB career staffer. A Senate committee is set to hold hearings on Trump's nominees on Wednesday. An NLRB spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the delays. William Cowen, the board's acting general counsel, in an August press release addressing efforts in several states to pass new labor protections said the agency's work has ""largely been unaffected"" by the lack of quorum. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Trump's decision to remove Wilcox. EMPLOYERS APPEAL UNIONIZATION VOTES Like Whole Foods, other companies also have argued that the board is legally barred from resolving union election disputes until its authority is restored. The appeals identified by Reuters include a CVS store in Wakefield, Rhode Island, and Discovery Cove, an Orlando-based theme park owned by SeaWorld, that argued that union elections cannot be certified while the board has too few members. Nearly all 22 of the cases that raise this issue were filed by a handful of powerhouse law firms that specialize in union deterrence. Discovery Cove, SeaWorld and their lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A CVS spokesperson declined to comment. Erin Schaefer, an attorney representing Whole Foods, discussed the hamstrung board in a podcast that was posted in February to the website of her law firm, Epstein Becker Green, two days after the company submitted its initial NLRB filing objecting to the union election. ""If you have an issue or a decision pending before the board, because the board doesn't have a quorum right now, the board will not be issuing decisions,"" Schaefer told the podcast. Schaefer and her firm did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has sought this year to bring under his sway federal agencies like the NLRB that were set up by Congress to be independent from a president's direct control. The labor law limbo that has stalled unionization efforts provides an example of the real-world impact of a series of Supreme Court interim rulings this year that have let contentious actions by Trump go into effect after lower courts impeded them. The appeals filed by employers since Trump fired Wilcox involve unionization efforts by more than 2,600 workers in 21 states and Washington, D.C., according to the Reuters review of cases. These have cut across a wide range of professions, from dialysis clinicians in Vallejo, California, to painters in Seattle, to housekeeping employees at a hotel located three blocks from the White House. Four cases are no longer active. Reuters could not immediately determine why they ended. The rate of election appeals by companies in the time from Wilcox's firing to the end of August was more than double the rate filed during the same time frame last year when the NLRB was fully functional, the Reuters tally showed. The healthcare industry accounts for more than a quarter of the cases in the Reuters tally of appeals. One example involves a group of Boston-based primary care physicians at Mass General Brigham, the largest healthcare system in Massachusetts, who voted to unionize in May. Organizers cited high levels of burnout and stagnant compensation amid increasing workloads. ""We're a hospital, we're not a business. We're supposed to take care of the sick and needy,"" said Dr. L. Elizabeth Lincoln, a primary care physician who has helped lead the union drive. ""We are not given a seat at the table. That's what we're seeking."" Mass General Brigham filed an NLRB appeal in May, challenging the composition of the group of employees that would be represented by the union. It also argued that the disputed election should not have been permitted to move forward when the board had too few members. Jessica Pastore, a spokesperson for Mass General Brigham, told Reuters that ""it would be inappropriate to begin bargaining without a final determination on whom we are bargaining for."" STALLED IN WASHINGTON Usually, a unionization vote is quickly certified by one of the NLRB's 26 regional offices, triggering an employer's duty to bargain. Union campaigns are especially vulnerable to being undermined by an employer in their earlier stages, six labor law experts told Reuters. This includes the period arising after an election but before a union has negotiated for better working conditions - the phase that the Philadelphia Whole Foods workers are in. ""Delays are the friend of employers. They undermine worker power, undermine union support and undermine confidence in the government,"" said Jennifer Abruzzo, who served as the NLRB's general counsel under Democratic President Joe Biden before being fired by Trump on the same night as Wilcox. 'SO SCARY' Whole Foods filed five objections to the Philadelphia union election, including the NLRB quorum issue and a claim that the union wrongly promised workers that voting for it would result in a pay raise. The NLRB regional office overruled the objections in May and certified that a majority of workers had voted to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The Whole Foods spokesperson told Reuters ""we strongly disagree"" with the regional office's conclusion. The company filed its appeal to the NLRB in June. According to Dupree and union officials, Whole Foods has waged a war of attrition at the Philadelphia store during the NLRB's standstill. Whole Foods has carried out 11 retaliatory firings of pro-union workers since the January election, according to union filings alleging illegal labor practices. One case filed in July alleges that Whole Foods fired three union supporters on the pretext of helping themselves to too many food samples such as cake wedges put out for customers. ""You can use all these tactics to erode the support of the union ... if you make it so scary and so unpleasant and so perilous to be associated with the union,"" said Michelle Devitt, a lawyer for the union and the fired Whole Foods workers. Reuters could not independently confirm claims by organizers of retaliation. Dupree, who has worked at the Whole Foods in Center City Philadelphia since 2016, said that he and his coworkers are persevering as they seek higher wages, more healthcare benefits and greater job security. ""Workers organizing is not going to stop just because the NLRB is, you know, stymied,"" Dupree said. The Whole Foods spokesperson said the company does not tolerate retaliation and respects the legal rights of its employees. The company declined to comment on specific alleged reprisals. Those allegations are currently under investigation by the NLRB regional office.

Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals - with 53% of Brits suffering problems with wifi | Bristol Live,"More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",Bristol Post,2025-10-01T10:02:12Z,https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-10540582,2025-10-01 18:30:10.316962,-0.1607843137254902

Novant spends $5 million to add lots near Kernersville Medical Center,"Novant Health Inc. has spent just more than $5 million to purchase five undeveloped tracts totaling 18.44 acres near its Kernersville Medical Center campus. According to a Forsyth County Register of Deeds filing Monday, the properties are: a 10-acre lot listed as 0 Kernersville Medical Parkway; a 4.66-acre lot listed as 0 Kernersville Medical Parkway; a 2.72-acre lot at 1580 Brookford Road; an 0.59-acre lot at 1550 Brookford Road; and an 0.47-acre lot at 1524 Brookford Road. The seller of each property was SLP Reinvestment LLC of Winston-Salem. The purchase could represent the completion of a 14-year plan to create a 70-acre campus with the hospital as its anchor. Novant said in a statement that ""we consistently evaluate opportunities to address future health care needs and invest in property as part of this long-term planning, including recent land purchases in Kernersville."" ""At this time, we do not have detailed plans to share about the use of the land, but will update the community as details develop."" When the Kernersville hospital opened in March 2011 on a 32-acre tract off Kernersville Medical Parkway, Novant said its plans were to eventually have a 77-acre campus in the area. In April 2012, Novant spent $2.1 million to buy 7 acres adjacent to the hospital and next to Macy Grove Road. At that time, the system said it had long-term options to buy another neighboring 30 acres. In October 2012, Novant paid $4 million to buy a 16.7-acre site adjacent to the hospital on its west side. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ The business news you need Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.

"DART makes offer to pay back cities, but some already thinking about leaving the agency","Leaders at Dallas Area Rapid Transit are hoping to avoid losing future funding with a new program that raises questions of cities withdrawing from the agency. The DART board on Tuesday approved sending an agreement to seven member cities - Addison, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Plano, Richardson, University Park, and the town of Highland Park - that would distribute money back to them as part of the agency's new General Mobility Program, or GMP. ""This is a way for us to incentivize the cities to work together and solution-build, and also recapture some of the money, because that would be a big hit to us if there was a reduction or redirection of the penny,"" said Kay Shelton, chief of staff and strategy with DART. DART's board of directors has been struggling to balance its budget with the needs of cities that are paying in more than they get back in public transit services. The board recently approved service reductions that include cutting routes and frequency across its system as a way to fund the GMP. The board voted to create the program in March as a way to stave off attempts during the recent regular legislative session to defund 25% of DART's sales tax collection. The agency gets 1% or a penny for each sales tax dollar from each of its 13 member cities. The GMP would return 5% of the agency's annual sales tax revenue to eligible cities to fund non-DART transit projects. While a majority of directors ultimately voted to approve sending the interlocal agreement on the GMP to the seven cities, some leaders didn't agree with a section of the text that calls to penalize cities that might negatively impact DART's funding. If a city pursues legislation to cut contributions to DART or calls for a withdrawal election, the agency will pull any unspent GMP funding plus interest. Irving Mayor Rick Stopfer, who represents his city on the board, said he disagrees with the terms even after Irving leaders pulled back from discussing legislation in city council. ""I can tell you that it will probably happen at some point,"" he said ""We can't continue to pay the money into DART and lose the services we're losing."" Irving isn't one of the member cities that is eligible for the GMP, but Stopfer has told the board he has had issues with poor service in his city for years. He added that Irving is already in talks with legislators and ""prospective legislators"" and isn't ruling out withdrawing from DART entirely. ""None of this is going to go anywhere because we probably will call for an election,"" Stopfer said. ""It's just a matter of if it's in May or if it's in November."" Anthony Ricciardelli, who represents Plano on the board, said he opposes penalizing cities for pursuing legislative action. Plano Mayor John Muns has said in a previous statement to KERA that ""all options"" are on the table with DART, alluding to withdrawal. ""We talked a lot in the 89th session about ... the penny comes from the voters, the voters make that decision,"" Ricciardelli said. ""The voters could change that."" He said cities have the option to hold a withdrawal election next year. ""That's a window that comes up every six years,"" he said. ""I don't think any city has been trying to withhold that from their voters."" Michele Wong Krause, one of Dallas's eight representatives on the board, said the stipulation on legislative action would help DART survive if funding eventually gets cut in the future. ""That the monies are reimbursed is going to be critical ... especially for the first year or two after that quarter cent should, you know, should that happen,"" she said. ""We're going to need that just to really even have the most fundamental of transit service."" During public comment at the general board meeting, several speakers said the language in the agreement didn't go far enough to keep cities from pursuing legislation or withdrawing from the agency. Many blamed leaders in Plano for attempting to ""loot"" DART. ""I would pray the board sees that Plano will never come to the negotiating table in good faith, and I applaud the board for drafting an agreement that exposes that so clearly,"" said Plano resident Brandon Bullock. Brinda Gurumoorthy told the board the most recent cuts to services have already been detrimental for DART riders. ""If the GMP continues for a while and we also leave open the door to further legislative action or things like that, we will suffer and we will continue to see DART deteriorate,"" Gurumoorthy said. ""The people who suffer are going to be all over the metroplex, including in Plano, including in Carrollton."" Ricciardelli said Plano has put its own money into local transit, including the new Silver Line opening later this month. ""The idea that Plano has not invested even beyond the one cent of sales tax is also false,"" he said. Pablo Arauz Peña is KERA's growth and infrastructure reporter. Got a tip?

They Signed Up For Co-Living In Honolulu And Got A 'Hell Hole',"Dozens of people have been living in a downtown office building without kitchens, air conditioning and proper ventilation. The landlord says he is working to address safety concerns and plans to convert the building to student housing. Christina Jordan was desperate for a place to live in February when she found what seemed a solution: a three-room office suite for $2,500 a month in downtown Honolulu. It had no bathrooms, kitchen or windows -- and she later learned, no certificate of occupancy. But there would be room for herself and two of her kids. Plus, she says, the building's co-owner, developer Chad Waters, told her he had grand plans for transforming it into a mixed-use housing and entertainment hub and said she could do work around the building to help cover her rent. Jordan now says life at 1136 Union Mall was a nightmare. She moved out in May. For the last year, dozens of people have been living in the office building without kitchens, air conditioning and proper ventilation -- and limited access to showers, multiple current and former residents told Civil Beat. Despite complaints to city and state agencies, conditions for residents have deteriorated. A police officer noted the building was totally unsecured in April, the same month a tenant reported a teenager had been sexually assaulted in the family's unit. Waters has admitted the building is plagued with health and safety issues: air conditioning failures, elevator malfunctions, security deficiencies, potable and wastewater leakages, pest infestation and electrical hazards. On Saturday, the day after responding to Civil Beat's request for an interview about the building, Union Mall Development Group posted announcements that everybody -- even commercial tenants -- had to move out by Tuesday for repairs. The notice said no rent would be due on Oct. 1, and this month's rent would be prorated until the repairs were completed. It didn't say how long that would take. Tenants expressed concern that the repairs are just a way to get rid of them. The building is a grotesque version of what policymakers have described when calling for adapting vacant office buildings to be residences. Part of the vision is to address critical housing needs while revitalizing Honolulu's flagging central business district, where small businesses are struggling as office workers increasingly work from home. An ardent champion of converting underused downtown office buildings into residences, Honolulu City Councilman Tyler Dos Santos-Tam helped pass an ordinance allowing such reuses, leading to big investments by developers. But, Dos Santos-Tam noted, permits are still needed, which the Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting confirmed Waters doesn't have. ""It's not like you can take an office,"" Dos Santos-Tam said, ""and shove a lot of people in there and call it a day."" Waters declined interview requests for this story. In a written statement, he stressed that he is planning a complete overhaul of the building. ""We are designing plans right now that will convert the building to residential use,"" he said. ""Our redevelopment plans include a full-scale renovation -- stripping the building down to its structural core and completely rebuilding all mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems to meet modern codes and sustainability standards,"" he said. In his statement to Civil Beat, Waters said his company is working to move tenants out. ""The process of vacating the remainder of the building will continue through mid next year,"" he added. ""The building wide renovation will start when the building is 100% vacant and the plans are approved by the DPP."" An ownership entity for the project has committed $8.5 million for the project, he said. Davis Pitner, a spokesman for the Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting, said Waters and co-owner Scott Bingo haven't applied for a permit needed for a group living facility or to change the use from office to residential. Located just off Bishop Street, 1136 Union Mall is a white, 50-year-old building tucked into a pedestrian lane in downtown Honolulu's central business district. Tenants once included the state Judiciary's Office of Disciplinary Counsel; Orig Media, a high-end video production firm; a pilates studio; the nonprofit Mental Health America of Hawaiʻi, and a handful of lawyers. The building is owned by Waters and Bingo through an entity called Union Mall Development Group LLC. Property records indicate they bought the building for $6.5 million from Tomoya Tsuruhara in April 2024. They financed the acquisition with a $5.2 million loan from Tsuruhara, which was secured by the building, court documents indicate. Tsuruhara has now brought a foreclosure action against Waters, Bingo and their company, which they're fighting. The building's business-mixed use zoning classification, which existed before Dos Santos-Tam's ordinance, allows for a range of uses, including office, residential and even a hotel. But zoning isn't enough. An office-to-residential conversion would also require a use permit allowing the conversion, as well as a building permit to address potential issues like increased plumbing needs. Construction permitting and work usually requires considerable back-and-forth between the developer and the department. Once the department determines everything is in order and meets basic health and safety codes, the developer can get a certificate of occupancy allowing people to move in. In a written statement, Waters said that when they bought the property, he and Bingo envisioned turning it into student housing. Architectural renderings of their plans show lanais on three sides of the building to ""provide natural light, ventilation, and usable outdoor space for future residents."" Some parts of the nine-floor building already are clean and tidy, marketed as DoHo Suites vacation rentals. One floor, a former co-working space now leased by DoHo Suites, has an impressive foyer with potted plants and a kitchen area. But the floors Waters has been renting out as unpermitted ""co-living"" spaces are another story: warrens of windowless former offices where residents resort to running long extension cords for lights. Shared kitchens consist of microwaves, rice cookers, coffee pots and other appliances on counters in vacant units. Shared bathrooms feature water pipes placed above urinals serving as makeshift showers. There's little to no ventilation and, on a recent visit, no air conditioning. That tenants have been willing to live with the conditions at 1136 Union Mall underscores the challenges Hawai'i residents face in a market where the median housing cost is 2.7 times the national average. Jordan moved her family into 1136 Union Mall out of desperation. She had moved to Hawaiʻi in October 2024 for a maintenance job at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikīkī, she says. She landed at her brother's place, while her two kids stayed behind in Tennessee, living with friends while they finished the school term. By February, her kids needed to move to Hawaiʻi, so she needed a bigger place. Panic set in when she saw what so many in the state experience: no responses to dozens of inquiries about places for rent. She found 1136 Union Mall through her son's friend Brian Foehrenbach, who was living there. She remembers Waters marketing the building as a residential co-living space. The photos he showed her looked nice, Jordan says. And Waters seemed professional. ""The man looks so official,"" she said. Jordan says she signed the lease without seeing the unit and was disappointed from the outset. ""I should have waited until I saw the unit, but there was a sense of urgency,"" she says. ""I had to have a place."" The lack of windows, bathroom and kitchen, it turns out, was the least of her problems. A recent tour of 1136 Union Mall's co-living spaces showed a building in disarray. Jordan, who moved out of the building in May, was joined by Foehrenbach and Enshaquawa Moore, a current tenant who says she was one of the first to move her residence into a vacant office around October. They led the way through long, poorly lit and unventilated hallways connecting former offices where sand-like construction debris lay scattered on carpeting. The heat was stifling. Moore said the building has slouched into disarray since she first moved there. At the time, she said, the place still had business tenants, some of which said they left as the building fell into disrepair. ""Now,"" she said, ""it's like a hell hole."" The trio told of faulty elevators and threats of electricity shut-offs, which they documented with photos showing notice of an impending power shut-off. A photo and video show sparks coming from an electrical panel on the building's second floor. It was the heat and lack of ventilation, one tenant says, that led to an alleged incident in April involving a 16-year-old girl. The family was sleeping with the door to the unit ajar to allow air to come in, another tenant came into the until and assaulted the girl. Another tenant called the police; a trial is set for Dec. 1. In an email, Waters said he at times has employed licensed security contractors but now has none. In place of the door and lock on the building's back door is a rusting metal rectangle. The neat rows of mailboxes can't be used, they said, because the landlord never gave them keys. Residents can't use the mailboxes assigned to their units, Waters confirmed, saying the boxes are only for commercial tenants. Beyond the problems with power, showers and kitchens was what tenants described as the emotional damage that came with the broken promise of a safe, healthy place to live. John Serrano, who lives in the building with his wife and 9-month-old baby, sat shirtless in the heat of his unit's common area, talking about the lack of air conditioning. He was lucky, he said, to have access to a water faucet so he could bathe his baby in a plastic tub. In addition to the unsafe living conditions, Jordan and Serrano both allege that Waters also stiffed them for work they did on the building. Not being paid by Waters was especially hard, Serrano said, because he has a criminal record that makes it hard for him to get a job. Waters, however, said in his written response that he has no record of hiring Serrano to do work. And he said Jordan was compensated. Some tenants said they fear retaliation for complaining about health and safety violations to management or reporting problems to authorities. Kamaka Pahinui is a former Union Mall Development Group administrator who rents what she describes as a ""glorified storage locker"" for $1,300 a month for her and her four cats. She said she was threatened with eviction after she complained about the lack of a lock on a bathroom door -- an accusation Waters denies. Others like Lacey ʻĀina, staffing supervisor for Alliance Personnel Inc., formerly located on the building's seventh floor, said they have complained to multiple city and state agencies to no avail. In April, ʻĀina outlined her efforts in a letter emailed to Dos Santos-Tam. According to the letter, she said she contacted the Honolulu Police Department regarding ""a registered sex offender currently living and working in the building"" who ""claims to be a manager and has access to all tenant spaces and restrooms."" She told Dos-Santos Tam she had contacted the fire department to report that, ""Fire exits are either locked or blocked by cars, trucks, or trash. All fire extinguishers are expired. The sprinkler and fire alarm systems are non-functional."" She contacted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ""after witnessing a man throwing metal poles from the second floor into a rubbish truck. I have video and photo evidence."" According to ʻĀina, ""OSHA responded but did not act, stating the individual could not be tied to any company."" The Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting has issued seven notices of violation against the property since March. These include two for using the building as housing without a certificate of occupancy; three for performing alterations without building permits and two for operating an unpermitted bed and breakfast and advertising the rental for less than 30 days. Pitner, the DPP spokesman, said the short-term rental citations have been addressed, although a $10,000 fine remains outstanding. Pitner said, ""the Department will be reaching out to the property's mortgagee to notify them of the violations that may be in violation of terms of the mortgage."" Rex Matsuo, owner of DoHo Suites, said he had taken down any advertising indicating the units could be rented for less than 30 days, in accordance with the law. He also said Waters hadn't notified him about any outstanding fine. Matsuo said he had believed he could use the building as a short-term rental because the building is not in a residential area, there's a new hotel located nearby and the building's zoning allows it to be used as a hotel. Complaints to the police also have borne few results. The Honolulu Police Department sent an officer to the building in April after Neighborhood Board Chair Ernest Caravalho reported alleged illegal drug use and prostitution in and around the building, including an allegation that part of the building was being used as a brothel. The officer reported people using offices as homes, scattered between offices undergoing demolition. The building, he reported, appeared to be ""completely unsecured."" He found no evidence of a brothel but added: ""I think it would be naive to think that there is no criminal activity happening."" In his statement, Waters deflected the issues to tenants and said he's been trying to get rid of occupants deemed to be problems. He said he has 12 pending evictions, ""primarily involving tenants engaged in activities that pose risks to the building and its occupants,"" the statement says. He said he had tried to work with tenants. ""However, in situations where those efforts failed and public safety became a concern,"" he said, ""we have had to take appropriate action to ensure the integrity and future of the building."" On Sunday, many tenants awoke to find the notices acknowledging the health and safety problems residents say they've been living with for months. But they were shocked to have just a few days' notice to relocate. Titled, ""Notice of Health and Safety Repairs,"" the document explained that the building's utilities and elevators must be shut down to do the repairs. As a result, after 5 p.m. Tuesday, ""no tenants, guests or occupants will be allowed in the building until the aforementioned repairs have been completed,"" the notice said. Matsuo, the owner of DoHo Suites, blames Waters for the problems he says Waters is citing to justify removing everyone from the building. The two already are embroiled in litigation. Waters in September sued to evict Matsuo and take over the DoHo Suites, alleging Matsuo hasn't paid approximately $35,000 in rent for June and July. Matsuo says he was never repaid for $35,000 he contributed to prevent the building's power from being shut off in April. The case has been sent to mediation. On Monday, Matsuo filed a request for a temporary restraining order asking the court to prevent Waters from shutting off the utilities. The request says Waters' move amounts to an illegal ""constructive eviction"" that occurs when a landlord makes a property uninhabitable or unfit for its intended use. In a declaration filed with the court, Matsuo asserts Waters said he wanted DoHo Suites to leave so Waters could rent the building to Hawaiʻi Pacific University. Matsuo also says Waters has not done repairs required under multiple agreements. The filing includes text messages between Waters and Matsuo as exhibits. In them, Matsuo asserts he has paid Waters $200,000 since January and has canceled checks to prove it. Waters has denied Matsuo paid that much. ""Guess what?"" Waters says at one point in the text exchange. ""Power and elevator going to be off for 2-4 weeks. Actually might be permanent."" Waters is also in a legal battle facing allegations from the building's former owner. Tomoya Tsuruhara, who loaned Waters and Bingo $5.2 million to buy the property, filed a lawsuit in June alleging Waters, Bingo and their company have defaulted on the loan he gave them. Waters and Bingo have responded in court documents that an underground property encroachment of a neighboring building -- which they allege Tsuruhara didn't disclose -- amounted to a known material defect that prevented them from refinancing the loan. Also pending is an eviction case that Waters and Bingo's company has brought against Moore for not paying $837 in rent for an office suite. During a hearing on Sept. 12, Moore alleged Waters engaged in retaliatory harassment by shutting off her power. District Court Judge Denise Kawatachi ordered the parties to try to settle the matter through mediation. In the meantime, the judge ordered Moore to pay $837 a month into a rental trust fund. Moore acknowledges she quit paying rent, but says it was only after Waters cut off the building's air conditioning and she was prevented from using the building's ninth-floor shower, a clean facility used by DoHo Suites. ""I don't know where to go with this,"" she said. ""Can he make it right? Can he make it livable? If not, how can he make it right for the people who have been paying rent?"" For Christina Jordan, the Union Mall experience is in her rearview mirror. She now lives in a five-bedroom house in Makiki Heights, which she shares with her children, Foehrenbach and another roommate. They pay $3,100 a month, a deal Jordan says she was able to get because the house is slated to be torn down soon to make way for a new high-rise. Jordan and her roommates had to scrape together $9,000 to move into the new place, which Jordan says wiped out her savings. Still, she says, she's glad to be out of 1136 Union Mall and, where she hopes her continued willingness to speak out will lead to changes. ""There's just so much happening,"" she said, "" to so many people that don't know how to stand up for themselves,"" she said.",Honolulu Civil Beat,2025-10-01T10:01:00Z,https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/10/they-signed-up-for-co-living-in-honolulu-and-got-a-hell-hole/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.320381,0.0117647058823529
Mesta Secures $5.5 Million Seed Round To Redefine Cross-Border Payments,"Mesta, the Global fiat + Stablecoin Payment Network, today announced it has raised a $5.5 million seed round led by Village Global, with participation from Circle Ventures, Paxos, and WTI - Western Technology Investment. Existing backers including Garuda Ventures, Canonical Crypto, Everywhere Ventures, and Inventum Ventures also reaffirmed their support. Mesta will deploy this capital to expand its global payment features, strengthen its international teams, and accelerate growth worldwide. Since its launch just 11 months ago, Mesta has cemented itself as one of the fastest growing cross-border payment networks, combining the reliability of fiat rails with the efficiency of stablecoin rails. The company has processed more than $140 million in total payment volume (TPV) to date, with transaction volumes scaling more in the last two months than the first nine combined. Today, Mesta executes an average of $3 million in daily volume and is on track to surpass $300 million in TPV by year-end. Scaling the Payment Network That Solves Cross-Border Pain Cross-border payments have historically forced businesses to choose between speed and cost -- sacrificing one for the other. Mesta solves this problem by combining fiat rails for reliability and compliance with stablecoin rails for speed and cost-efficiency, creating a single, faster, cheaper and more efficient hybrid payment network. Mesta enables enterprise-grade cross-border payments across multiple use cases such as bill payments, payroll, supply chain payments and same name On/Off ramps. Mesta's customers span the full spectrum of Web2 and Web3 - from payment companies, SMB fintechs, crypto wallets, OTC desks, and more. With support for USD, EUR, GBP, USDC, USDT, USDG and PYUSD, Mesta can convert these into global Stablecoins and 40+ global currencies via hybrid rails that eliminate the inefficiencies of legacy systems such as SWIFT. Its local rails built natively in many currencies deliver unmatched cost, speed, and compliance advantages - without the need for pre-funded pools. Mesta's settlement times are very often just a few minutes and their customers save more than 50% on fees. ""Our mission at Mesta is to rewire the way money moves globally - faster, cheaper, and at enterprise-grade accuracy, without sacrificing compliance,"" said Sandeep Pyapali, Founder & CEO of Mesta. ""In under a year, we've proven the demand for hybrid fiat + stablecoin rails. This seed round allows us to double down on scaling our network and building the holy grail: the ability to move money seamlessly between any two fiat currencies worldwide."" Why Now: Timing with the Genius Act and Market Momentum The recently passed Genius Act, coupled with rising liquidity and adoption of stablecoins, signals a regulatory and market environment that is finally ready for enterprise-grade blockchain-enabled payments. Mesta anticipated this convergence early, building a network that combines the best of blockchain innovation with regulated fiat corridors -- positioning it as the go-to infrastructure for the next wave of global money movement. The Founder Factor: Experience That Wins Sandeep brings unmatched expertise to Mesta, having previously spearheaded the Uber Global Payment Network, facilitating billions in transactions across 70+ countries. His leadership experience at PayPal and BILL, gives him a unique perspective on what it takes to build a global, compliance-first, enterprise-grade network that addresses the real-world pain points of payments teams. ""When policy and innovation align, entire economies benefit,"" Sandeep added. ""We foresaw this moment, built the rails early, and now we are ready to help fintechs, wallets, and enterprises move money without friction."" Investor Confidence in the Future of Payments ""Cross-border payments remain one of the most broken areas in global finance. Mesta's hybrid rails - stablecoin + fiat, offer a real, enterprise-ready solution that the market has been waiting for,"" said Jacob Mullins, Venture Partner at Village Global. ""We are proud to back Sandeep and the Mesta team as they continue to accelerate adoption among fintechs, wallets, and enterprises worldwide."" With strategic partnerships across leading fintech organizations, liquidity providers, and banks, Mesta is building a resilient, compliance-first network designed to become the global standard for cross-border money movement.",Financial IT,2025-10-01T10:11:18Z,https://financialit.net/news/fundraising-news/mesta-secures-55-million-seed-round-redefine-cross-border-payments,2025-10-01 18:30:10.320887,0.1686274509803922

SARS has a big eFiling fraud problem,"A new draft report revealed the extent of alleged eFiling profile hijackings in South Africa, finding that a considerable number of fraudulent transactions ranged from R10,000 to R100,000. This report also outlined how fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the South African Revenue Service's (SARS) fraud detection processes. The Office of the Tax Ombud (OTO) published its Draft Report into alleged eFiling Profile Hijacking on Wednesday, 1 October, for public comment. This report follows a systemic investigation the OTO conducted into alleged eFiling profile hijacking. The investigation commenced in August 2024, following approval from the Finance Minister on 12 August 2024. Between 3 February and 5 March 2025, the OTO conducted the eFiling Profile Hijacking Survey to capture taxpayers' experiences and challenges related to eFiling profile hijacking. On 1 October, the OTO revealed three key findings from this survey - The survey results indicated that the estimated amount of fraud in most eFiling profile hijacking cases, which is less than R10,000, is at 37%. The estimated amount of fraud ranging from R10,000 to R99,999 is 33%, the estimated amount of fraud ranging from R100,000 to R999,999 is 14%, and the estimated amount of fraud more than R1 million is 16%. The report explained that the reason the estimated amount of fraud for profile hijacking is mostly less than R10,000 is largey because SARS has automated risk detection systems that flag refund claims above certain thresholds, such as R10,000 or R15,000, for audit or verification. Fraudsters are aware of this and, therefore, deliberately submit refund claims just below these thresholds to avoid detection and increase the chances of payouts. These scammers will, therefore, also aim for smaller, quicker wins less likely to trigger a delay or review and staying under R10,000 is a tactical move to reduce the chance of SARS intervening. In other words, smaller fraudulent refunds are less likely to raise suspicion, for example, a fraudster can hijack 100 profiles and claim R2,000 from each, totalling R200,000, with a low risk of triggering audit. The report also highlighted several vulnerabilities in the eFiling process, including inadequate authentication processes, challenges in fraud detection, delayed SARS response times, insider threats, and low digital security awareness among taxpayers. The report explained that challenges with fraud detection and slow response mechanisms allow hijackers to access and misuse eFiling profiles undetected. One of these challenges is SARS' reliance on taxpayer-initiated fraud reports rather than automated fraud detection systems. Fraudsters can take advantage of this vulnerability by removing fraudulent details before SARS intervenes. Therefore, the OTO recommended that SARS enhance its authentication protocols, improve fraud detection and refund verification systems, and boost taxpayer education. It further recommended that the taxman strengthen its collaboration with banks, the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission, and the South African Police Service. Tax practitioners are also urged to implement stricter controls on third-party access and uphold high professional conduct standards. The report urged taxpayers to use strong passwords, activate two-factor authentication, and regularly monitor eFiling profile activities. The OTO further recommended that the National Treasury amend certain provisions in the Tax Administration Act and establish an Inspector-General as recommended by the Nugent Commission of inquiry. The South African Reserve Bank is urged to investigate banking irregularities linked to eFiling profile hijacking. The OTO also invited written comments on the draft report on eFiling profile hijacking with the aim of developing a robust and effective response to eFiling profile hijacking. This will ensure the protection of taxpayers' rights and enhance trust in South Africa's tax administration system.",dailyinvestor.com,2025-10-01T10:11:16Z,https://dailyinvestor.com/finance/103791/sars-has-a-big-efiling-fraud-problem/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.321377,-0.3176470588235294
Renewed calls for ring road in County Roscommon town - News - Roscommon Herald,"There are renewed calls for a ring road in Castlerea to help remove some of the heavy traffic currently choking up the middle of town on the N60 route. Fine Gael Senator Gareth Scahill, who is making the call, pointed out that the volume of traffic in the town is set to increase even further when the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue road project is complete. ""The new N5 is going to be the direct Dublin Road now and traffic will be coming off the N5 from Frenchpark to Castlerea, heading to Williamstown and Ballyhaunis. So, there's going to be a higher traffic of volume on the N60,"" he said. Senator Scahill said that a previous traffic survey showed that 70% of vehicles that go through Castlerea don't stop and many of them are HGVs. Calls for a ring road have been made over the years and the local senator is now calling for a strategy to be put in place, as a first step, for such a route. ""We've been approved for Town Centre First funding which is aimed at opening up the town. If we were to take away a volume of that traffic, it would make the town a lot more accessible and safer for people,"" he said. Senator Scahill has also raised related concerns that the very busy junction at 'Hell's Kitchen corner' in the town will bear the brunt of increased traffic when the new N5 upgrade is complete. He explained that he recently conducted an accessibility survey with the Brothers of Charity and that particular junction was highlighted as a major problem for service users. Senator Scahill has previously raised the ring road proposal with Eamon Ryan when he was Environment Minister and also with the current minister in that Department, Darragh O'Brien. He is raising the matter again in the Seanad this morning, Wednesday.",Roscommon Herald,2025-10-01T10:11:21Z,https://www.roscommonherald.ie/news/renewed-calls-for-ring-road-in-county-roscommon-town_arid-72626.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.321572,0.1843137254901961

Fuel Station Owner Cries Foul Over TotalEnergies Standoff - Ghanamma.com,"Owner of Powerland TotalEnergies Service Station at Madina, Thomas Kofi Classpeter, has raised concerns over his inability to run his business following what he describes as a crippling regulatory impasse. According to him what began as a long-standing partnership with the multinational company is now threatening to wipe out his life's work. Mr. Classpeter, who claims to have worked with the company for nine years, said he built the Madina station and brought the oil giant onboard as a petroleum products supplier. But when he decided in July 7, 2023 to sever ties over what he described as 'exploitative' practices -- including unauthorised deductions from his commissions and fuel deliveries made without request -- his attempt to move on was frustrated. He claims the oil company refused to issue him a release letter, a vital regulatory document from the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) that allows a dealer to switch suppliers. Without the release letter, Mr. Classpeter indicates he is unable to sell fuel from any other company, leaving his multimillion-cedi investment in limbo. Court Case He recounted when TotalEnergies, on August 23, 2023, sued at an Accra High Court claiming ownership of the station. But after two years of legal battle, the presiding judge, Justice Patrick Baayeh, found that TotalEnergies' contribution of pumps, machines, and branding did not make it co-owner of the property. The court also ruled that the installation of CalBank's ATM at the station without Mr. Classpeter's consent was wrongful, ordering TotalEnergies to pay him 50% of the rental income collected. Additionally, he was awarded GH¢50,000 in costs. For Mr. Classpeter, the May 23, 2025 judgment should have paved the way for him to resume business, with the court directing TotalEnergies to issue the release letter within 30 days. Instead, he said more than 50 days later, TotalEnergies has filed an appeal and a stay of execution, effectively prolonging the closure. The appeal ensures that the station will remain closed until the case is fully resolved. MOU At the heart of the conflict lies a six-month Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in January 2014, under which the parties agreed to enter a 15-year contract after the expiration of the MoU, but that was never executed. Mr. Classpeter said the toll has been devastating. With loan repayments due, salaries unpaid, and equipment rusting at the abandoned station.",GHANA MMA,2025-10-01T09:57:36Z,https://www.ghanamma.com/2025/10/01/fuel-station-owner-cries-foul-over-totalenergies-standoff/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.322004,-0.1215686274509804
Porsche's Forgotten Icon Reborn With An Unexpected Twist | Carscoops,"Power will come from a modified, air-cooled 4.0-liter flat-eight with 400 hp. The Porsche Carrera GTS, more commonly known with its internal codename, 904, is a rare piece of homologated sports car royalty from the mid-60s. Six decades later, Dutch company Aerfal Automotive wants to bring it back as a stunning restomod with modern technology and Porsche underpinnings. The exterior stays true to the mid-engined proportions and sexy curves of the original, with a few tasteful revisions on the cooling intakes, LED lights, and vintage alloy wheels. The doors open together with big chunks of the roof, allowing easier access to the two-seater cabin. The interior will please fans of the analogue era with a minimalist dashboard, retro dials, and a combination of leather and titanium. Porsche built 106 roadgoing examples of the 904 between 1964 and 1965 as a homologation special. This means that sourcing a genuine chassis would be too expensive. Aerfal founder, Daniel Robledo, told Motor1 that their restomod will be based on the humble 914 instead. The mid-engined sports car that was developed by Porsche and VW is a lot easier to find, with 118,978 units leaving the factory between 1969 and 1974. The goal of the project was to answer the question ""What if Porsche's visionaries of the 1960s had access to the tools of today?"" This meant that the 914 base wouldn't be enough. Thus, the chassis will receive reinforcements from Multimatic, while Porsche specialist Tuthill will work on the suspension and chassis setup. Furthermore, The restomod will use parts sourced from Brembo, Michelin and BBS. More: Gunther Werks Just Built The Most Insane Air Cooled Porsche Ever Seen More importantly, the reborn 904 will be powered by a ""rebirth of the legendary flat-eight"" engine found in the original racecar with the rumored involvement of Cosworth. The air-cooled, naturally aspirated mill will be expanded from 2.0 to 4.0 liters, with a target output of 400 horsepower. ""This is not about chasing numbers, but about creating an engine that breathes character, a soundtrack and sensation that connects the driver directly to Porsche's primal racing heritage"", Aerfal notes. At the moment, Aerfal's 904 only exists in the digital world, but the company plans on building a prototype and will soon start receiving pre-orders. Pricing, planned production numbers, and a target date for the first deliveries have yet to be announced.",Carscoops,2025-10-01T10:10:00Z,https://www.carscoops.com/?p=3291875,2025-10-01 18:30:10.322260,0.2784313725490195
Gold flashes major sell-off signal since 1980,"Gold's historic rally has pushed the precious metal into its most extreme overbought technical condition in over forty years, flashing a major sell-off warning. Specifically, on the monthly chart, gold's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged to 90, marking the most overbought reading since 1980. Historically, elevated RSI levels have signaled exhaustion in bullish momentum, often preceding corrections or prolonged periods of consolidation. Notably, the last time gold reached this threshold was during the 1980 blow-off top, when prices soared to record highs before plunging in the years that followed. Currently trading near $3,900, gold has climbed 48% in 2025, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, central bank buying, and investor demand as a hedge against inflation and currency risk. However, the extreme RSI indicates overheating in gold and increases the risk of a sharp pullback, similar to the post-1980 correction, when speculation led to steep losses. Currently, gold is edging toward $4,000, now supported by the U.S. government shutdown that has driven safe-haven demand. With Washington gridlock deepening and expectations rising for a Federal Reserve rate cut, investors are pouring capital into gold as stocks face renewed pressure. Meanwhile, the weakening U.S. dollar is adding further support. In this case, a softer greenback, tied to prospects of looser monetary policy and falling bond yields, makes gold increasingly attractive. To this end, as of press time, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) was on track for its fourth straight day of losses, its longest losing streak since July. The index fell to 97.64 on Wednesday, extending its slide after peaking near 99 earlier in September. On the daily chart, the move mirrors July's pattern, when the dollar endured a four-day decline before briefly rebounding.",Finbold,2025-10-01T10:04:41Z,https://finbold.com/gold-flashes-major-sell-off-signal-since-1980/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.322456,-0.0117647058823529

Furious father slams 'soft on crime' policies after daughter allegedly killed by repeat offender in SC,"Stephen Frederico joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his testimony before House lawmakers demanding action to hold repeat violent criminals accountable after his daughter, Logan, was killed by suspect who had 39 prior arrests. A father is demanding action after his daughter was shot and killed during a home invasion in Columbia, South Carolina, by a repeat offender, police say. ""I'm not going away. My daughter isn't going away,"" Stephen Federico said Tuesday on ""America's Newsroom."" ""I can't save her now, but buckle up. Put your helmet on."" Logan Federico, 22, was visiting friends at a nearby university when she was killed during the break-in, police said. Her alleged killer has an extensive criminal record. PHIL MICKELSON CALLS OUT JUSTICE SYSTEM AFTER FATHER'S EMOTIONAL SPEECH ABOUT DAUGHTER'S KILLING Following his daughter's killing, Federico delivered an emotional plea to lawmakers during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Charlotte. ""Think about your child coming home from a night out with her friends, laying down, going to sleep. Feeling somebody come in the room and wake them,"" he said, fighting back tears. HEARTBROKEN FATHER SAYS 'GUT-WRENCHING' ERROR KEPT CAREER CRIMINAL OUT OF JAIL BEFORE DAUGHTER'S MURDER ""And drag her out of bed, naked, forced on her knees with her hands over her head, begging for her life, begging for her hero, her father, me. That couldn't be there."" Police have identified the suspect as Alexander Devante Dickey. Federico says Dickey had 39 prior charges, including 25 felony charges. He is now urging lawmakers to take stronger action against repeat offenders to avoid future tragedies. ""The soft on crime stuff has to stop. We have to be able to keep career criminals in prisons. We need more prisons, we need more mental institutions, we need more mental health,"" he said. Federico argued that if Dickey had been properly prosecuted and put in prison, his daughter might still be alive. FATHER OUTRAGED AFTER DISCOVERING DAUGHTER'S ALLEGED KILLER SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND BARS YEARS AGO Some Democrats pushed back, saying ""soft-on-crime"" policies were not to blame for Logan Federico's death and other killings. Instead, they pointed to local prosecutors and jurisdictions being underfunded and understaffed. Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C., delivered remarks at the hearing, noting that funding for local law enforcement and other criminal justice grants were being slashed. ""These cuts undermine public safety, and they don't give law enforcement the tools they need to keep us safe,"" she wrote in a statement. ""It took 10 minutes to find out that Alexander Dickey was a career criminal and what his extensive record was. They didn't bother to do their homework. That's the problem. It's not because they're understaffed, it's because they just didn't do the work.""",Fox News,2025-10-01T10:00:26Z,https://www.foxnews.com/media/furious-father-slams-soft-crime-policies-after-daughter-killed-repeat-offender-south-carolina,2025-10-01 18:30:10.323069,-0.3254901960784313

'Letters to the citizens of Georgia': the newspapers delivered by the mothers of the jailed,"From the repression of queer people and women in North Caucasus to attacks on basic democratic freedoms in the region, we provide fact-based, independent reporting in English. It all started on 31 May, when a handful of parents gathered outside the Avlabari Metro station in Tbilisi with posters of their loved ones, who are facing years behind bars after participating in Georgia's ongoing anti-government protests. Once assembled, they went down into the metro with a megaphone, speaking about their imprisoned relatives and the general state of democracy in Georgia. Since then, every weekend, and sometimes up to twice a week, a group of mothers gathers to go to a new location to distribute newspapers written from inside the prisons. As of publication, they've distributed over 50,000 copies across Georgia during their trips. One of the mothers, Nani Tsulaia, tells OC Media that the idea of doing something together came after she and other parents became disillusioned with the opposition, who she says did not have any ideas that could bring real results. Nani's son, 21-year-old medical student Giorgi Mindadze, was sentenced to five years in jail in July for allegedly throwing a firework at police. 'When we lost all hope, we, the parents, decided to unite, to hold hands and start going door to door, in the metro, in the streets -- to create discomfort for everyone everywhere so that we can get our children released from prison', she says. Then came the idea to create a newspaper. Earlier in the year, 19-year-old activist Zviad Tsetskhladze released a newspaper from prison called Cell 101, named after the number of his prison cell. The newspaper included his letters, an anthem, inspirational quotes, and historical facts about Georgia. Shortly after, online news outlet Batumelebi restored its print version to publish letters from imprisoned protesters. Finally, activist Teona Chalidze decided to take the initiative -- she wrote to prisoners and asked them to send her letters, using crowdfunding to put the newspaper together and print the first circulation. Later, a second edition was made, which also included letters from the prisoners' families. The newspaper gained its name: 'The voice of freedom from prison -- letters of political prisoners to the citizens of Georgia'. On 3 June in Tbilisi, several of the mothers, along with a handful of activists supporting them, prepared to go to Tbilisi's northern Gldani district. 'My beautiful one', Nani told her friend Marizi Kobakhidze, as she tied the Georgian flag around her shoulders. Marizi's son, Tornike Goshadze, was sentenced to two years in jail in September on charges of organising or taking part in actions that violate public order. Once the flag was in place and the newspapers collected, they began going into the crowd, distributing the papers. But not everyone met them warmly. Footage of another of the mothers, Marina Terishvili, being ignored by passersby as she attempted to hand out newspapers outside Akhmeteli Theatre Metro Station quickly went viral on social media. Terishvili's son, Giorgi Terishvili was recently sentenced to two years in jail; another of her children, Mamuka Terishvili, was gunned down by a sniper during a rally in 1992. There have been cases since when someone tore up a newspaper in front of the mothers. Everyone has different reactions to such negative attitudes. Marizi usually enters into a full argument to explain why her son being in prison is unjust and why Georgia is going in the wrong direction. Nani, however, blesses such people, wishing them a healthy good life before moving on with tears in her eyes. As Marizi says, if everyone was to meet them positively, they would not be in this situation today -- their sons would not be in jail, and there would be no newspapers to distribute. Even so, she says she still gets nervous when they go outside the cities to more remote areas, where Georgian Dream tends to see higher support. 'I was so tense even when we went to Batumi', she says. 'But soon I realised I was wrong.' 'We were overwhelmingly well received in [the town of] Mukhrani, for example; I didn't expect it', she adds. In turn, Nani says that whenever she hands the newspaper to someone, she makes sure to look them in the eye. 'In most cases, I can tell from those eyes what this person wants to tell us even before they speak. When I see that they are going to speak from the heart, I open my arms and hug them, you probably have noticed this', she says. Nargiz Davitadze -- whose son, 20-year-old Zviad Tsetskhladze, who was sentenced to 2.5 years in jail -- says that in some of these encounters she sees how Georgian Dream's propaganda works. Nargiz remembers being hurt after a person insulted her, including references to Georgian Dream propaganda, while she distributed newspapers in her hometown of Batumi. 'Then a second person appeared and scolded the first one, but they didn't care and said they wouldn't even use the newspaper as a hand fan. But usually the majority of people still meet us warmly', she says. Over time, their trips have become about more than distributing newspapers. In the Pankisi Valley, for example, the mothers visited the grave of Temirlan Machalikashvili, a 19-year-old who was shot dead by Georgian security forces in 2018. His father has been seeking a proper investigation ever since then, but in vain. They also went to the memorial of Giorgi Antsukhelidze, who fought and was killed during the August 2008 War. On different occasions, parents and family members have gathered outside prisons for the birthdays of their imprisoned children. Similarly, they were there for each other when verdicts were announced. Sometimes, the mothers would leave the hearings of their own children to attend the verdicts of others, as the hearings would overlap. Not everyone is supportive, however. For Nargiz, the most hurtful thing was to discover that some of those who grew up around her children, who were close, turned out to 'prefer' Georgian Dream's billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili to her son. 'They don't even write anymore, they don't ask how [her imprisoned son] is', she says. Yet, as Nani says, the fact their sons were arrested brought the parents together -- they've spent almost every day with each other since the arrests. 'We were complete strangers to each other, but we gathered and became one big family. We all have Rustaveli Avenue and the area outside parliament to stand together and care for each other, to share sorrows from the heart. When I am tired from work, I always try to come to Rustaveli for at least an hour, because I feel relieved, because I know people will care for me there, and will say warm things about my and others' children. Then life becomes slightly easier', Nani says. Marina Aptsiauri is the mother of Nika Katsia, who was one of the three protesters who was acquitted by the court of drug charges. Despite her son's release, she has continued attending the distribution trips, telling OC Media during one of these trips that she will continue to support the other mothers and fight the authorities until the last imprisoned protester is released. 'I will never lose these new friends, never, I know it', Nani says. 'I can't think of what could undo this relationship we have. If I hold a wedding for my son, I would invite these parents before anyone else [...] We went through so much together.' 'I remember my birthday, when my son was sentenced to five years in jail -- that same day, we came to the parliament. Everyone was there, hugging me, comforting me, I will never forget that. People were lining up to hug me. It was a very difficult day for me, Gio's verdict day, but these people helped me through it', she continues. Over the summer, together with activists and volunteers, the mothers have been to over 25 locations. 'Gio called me the other day and told me, you poor thing, if I wouldn't have been arrested, you would have never seen anything outside Rustavi', Nani says. Nargizi says she didn't have the chance to go to the Kakheti Region very often before those trips. 'It turns out Kakheti is so pretty. I also want to visit the villages in the conflict zone', she adds. Nani stops her at this point, however, and tells her she doesn't advise it, as she and Marizi went there during their trip in Samegrelo. 'We wept so much. It is so difficult when you are a Georgian in your country, in Georgia, and there are these barbed wires installed in such a way that you don't have the right to go beyond these wires, but beyond these wires there are those people whom you love so very much, it is very hard', Nani says. No matter where they go, however, they often get recognised, having become celebrities of a sort. This is usually the highlight of their day, when people remember them for their sons and for their fight for their children. 'Everything we do, every step we take is with a goal for it to bring results tomorrow, to free our boys. Not my son or her son separately, but we will fight until everyone is free', Nani says. Marizi says everything she talks about, it is never about her son only but about everyone else. 'We are proud of our sons. It is so hard when you wake up and he is not at home. You put your hand to your heart for it not to stop beating and then you get up knowing that you have to continue fighting', Marizi says. Nani says they don't know what the future will bring, but they won't stop. 'I don't know how much time it will take, but everyone will be released soon and the kindness will return to Georgia. We will have such a day one day. Then we once again will gather on Rustaveli, mothers with sons, to celebrate'.",OC Media,2025-10-01T10:03:55Z,https://oc-media.org/letters-to-the-citizens-of-georgia-the-newspapers-delivered-by-the-mothers-of-the-jailed/,2025-10-01 18:30:10.324230,-0.07450980392156858

GST revenues rise 9.1% in September: Collections hit Rs 1.89 lakh crore; outpace August surge - The Times of India,"India's goods and services tax (GST) revenues rose 9.1% year-on-year to Rs 1.89 lakh crore in September, Reuters reported citing government data.In August, Gross GST collections had stood at Rs 1.86 lakh crore, reflecting a 6.5% rise from Rs 1.75 lakh crore in the same month last year. Net collections for August were Rs 1.67 lakh crore, up 10.7% year-on-year.In July, net revenues had moderated to Rs 1.68 lakh crore, largely due to a higher volume of refunds issued during the month.Abhishek Jain, Indirect Tax Head&Partner, KPMG says ""It is heartening to see consistent growth in GST collections, especially when some stagnancy was expected due to postponed sales in the second fortnight of August following the announcement on GST rate rationalisation by PM on Aug 15. Another significant aspect is that this growth has continued despite the discontinuation of GST revenue from online money gaming businesses.""(Developing story) The TOI Business Desk is a vigilant and dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant business news from around the world to readers of The Times of India.

Light rain expected in Karachi today,"Fresh spell of rain comes under effect of distinct low-pressure system present over India's Gujarat Karachi may see light rain today (Wednesday) caused by a distinct low-pressure system over Gujarat, India, following heavy downpours that hit the city on Tuesday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast partly cloudy skies with chances of light rain or drizzle over the next 24 hours in Karachi. A weather analyst told Geo News that moderate rainfall is expected in some parts of the city, although the system's progression towards Karachi is very slow. The meteorological expert warned that the longer the system remains over the sea, the greater the chance it intensifies. Currently, the system lies approximately 310 kilometres southeast of Karachi and could develop into a depression within the next 12 hours. The Met Office said that temperatures are expected to reach a maximum of 35 to 37 degrees Celsius, with the minimum recorded at 25.5 degrees Celsius over the past day in the metropolis. Meanwhile, humidity levels stand at 81%, while winds blow from the northeast at 11 kilometres per hour. The weather department also warned of potential thunderstorms accompanied by rain and lightning in other parts of Sindh, including Mirpur Khas, Badin, and Hyderabad. Similar weather conditions are anticipated in Tharparkar, Umerkot, and Sanghar under the system's influence. Other areas including Jamshoro, Thatta, Sujawal, and Tando Muhammad Khan may also experience rain with thunderstorms. Marine conditions could become extremely rough, with winds potentially reaching speeds of 45 to 55 kilometres per hour. As a safety precaution, fishermen in Sindh are advised to avoid venturing into open seas until 3rd October. Intermittent heavy showers and strong winds battered Karachi on Tuesday, partially flooding roads and cooling the city's sweltering weather, but causing partial urban flooding and traffic disruptions. The current wet spell comes under the effect of the well-marked low-pressure system edged closer to the Arabian Sea, raising the risk of a tropical cyclone later this week. The PMD said moist currents from the Arabian Sea were driving widespread rain and thunderstorms across southeastern Sindh, affecting Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar and adjoining districts until October 2. According to the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Karachi, the low-pressure system is likely to move west-southwest and emerge into the Arabian Sea. Meteorologists said favourable conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures and upper-level divergence could cause it to intensify into a depression and possibly develop into a cyclone in the coming days. Officials clarified that there is no immediate threat to Pakistan's coastal belt. However, they warned that the sea will remain rough to very rough with squally winds between 45 and 55 kilometres per hour. Fishermen have been strictly advised not to venture into deep waters until October 2. Provincial disaster management authorities have instructed Deputy Commissioners and District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) across Sindh to stay on round-the-clock alert and prepare mitigation measures in case of emergencies. Authorities also warned that strong winds and lightning could damage weak structures, power poles, billboards and solar panels in vulnerable areas.",The News International,2025-10-01T10:04:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1347729-light-rain-expected-in-karachi-today,2025-10-01 18:30:10.325139,-0.0117647058823529
"Henrico approves settlement involving police officer, detainee in 2022 fatal crash","American Civil War Museum welcomes 2025 Pulitzer Prize winner; Construction outside CarMax Park schedule; Author donates to VCU, Library of VA Henrico County's board of supervisors has approved a settlement in a lawsuit filed after a police officer crashed his vehicle in 2022, significantly injuring a detainee. In the wreck, a Henrico police SUV collided with a pickup truck at the intersection of Chamberlayne and Wilkinson roads in the county's north side. Officer Trey Marshall Sutton, who was driving the SUV, died from his injuries. The other two people in his car, another officer and a man Henrico police previously arrested, were injured. The man arrested, Damian Cousins, suffered permanent injuries, his lawyer said, leading Cousins' father to file a $50 million motor vehicle lawsuit, claiming Sutton and the driver of the pickup were responsible for the injuries. The driver of the pickup truck, Jeffrey Adam Lankford, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The plaintiff later settled with Lankford and released him from the lawsuit. The case against Sutton's estate was set to go to trial in February, but court records indicate the trial is no longer scheduled. A spokesperson for Henrico County declined to reveal the terms of the settlement. The wreck occurred on the night of March 30, 2022, when Sutton was driving a Ford Police Interceptor north on Chamberlayne Road, according to court records. Cousins was seated in the front passenger seat with his hands cuffed behind him. As Sutton attempted to turn left onto Wilkinson Road, Lankford's Dodge Ram pickup truck, traveling south on Chamberlayne, struck Sutton's vehicle, according to court records. Sutton, who was 24 years old and a few weeks removed from the academy, died from his injuries. Cousins and the other officer suffered severe injuries but survived. $50 million lawsuit After the wreck, Cousins' father, Karl Green, filed a $50 million lawsuit against Lankford and Sutton's estate. Green's lawyer, Philip Marstiller of the firm Emroch & Kilduff, said Cousins suffered ""disabling"" and ""permanent"" injuries. Because Cousins was in the front right passenger seat as the police SUV turned left, he suffered the brunt of the impact, the lawyer said. Though Cousins was wearing a seat belt, he was unable to protect himself because his hands were cuffed, the lawyer added. Listen now and : Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts Cousins suffered fractures, internal injuries that required surgery and traumatic brain injuries, the lawyer said. He experienced permanent limited mobility in all four limbs and was ""severely impaired cognitively,"" the lawyer said in a court filing. Medical expenses reached $15 million. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff's lawyer blamed both drivers - Lankford for traveling at a dangerously high speed and Sutton for running a red light. Green's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Henrico County, Andrew Newby, asserted that Sutton's estate was not liable. Newby blamed the wreck on the other driver, Lankford, who Newby said in a court filing was traveling at almost 80 mph at the time of the wreck and ran a red light. Lankford, 18 years old at the time of the collision, ultimately pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to two months of house arrest. Shannon Taylor, Henrico's top prosecutor, said at the time that her office would have faced obstacles had it taken the case to trial. Lankford's defense was prepared to argue that Sutton ran the red light, not Lankford. Additionally, Lankford's vehicle was too old to contain an onboard computer that would have logged its speed. Prosecutors would have needed to estimate the pickup truck's speed based on traffic camera footage and cellphone location data, and there was no guarantee a judge would admit that kind of evidence. Newby, the attorney representing Sutton's estate, claimed Sutton was protected by sovereign immunity, a legal principle that can offer police officers protection in lawsuits for actions performed in their official capacity. The lawyer added that before the wreck occurred Henrico police had arrested Cousins on charges of violating a protective order and struggling with officers before they took him into custody. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that because Sutton had entered the intersection after the light turned red, Sutton was not eligible for sovereign immunity. Earlier this year, a judge ruled that Sutton's estate could not use sovereign immunity as a defense. The plaintiff ultimately released Lankford from the $50 million lawsuit. Lankford's two insurance policies paid Cousins $200,000 - the maximum the policies allowed - and a judge approved the settlement. Sutton's estate also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lankford. The two sides later settled after Lankford's insurance paid $200,000 to Sutton's estate, and Lankford agreed to pay an additional $40,000, according to court records. Lankford also promised to send a handwritten note to Sutton's family every year for five years on the anniversary of Sutton's death. Lankford's lawyer did not respond to a message seeking comment. Self-insurance as a form of protection Last month, Henrico's board of supervisors approved a resolution to settle Green's lawsuit against Sutton's estate. Four members of the five-person panel voted in favor of the settlement. Misty Roundtree, who represents the Three Chopt district, abstained, saying that she was once appointed to represent Cousins in a separate matter in her capacity as a private attorney. Henrico uses self-insurance and purchased insurance to protect from losses arising from county operations. Self-insurance is a mechanism in which an entity creates a reserve fund to spend on workers' compensation claims, auto claims and other claims against the county. This year, Henrico's department of risk management budgeted $7.5 million for claims. A spokesperson for the county declined to comment on the settlement.

Is it safe to travel to the Philippines? Foreign Office issues new advice after major earthquake,"A 6.9-magnitude earthquake in the central Philippines has raised concerns about the safety of travel plans to Southeast Asia. The quake struck off the coast of Bogo City in Cebu province in the central Visayas just before 10pm local time on Tuesday (30 September). At least 69 people have died after the powerful earthquake collapsed homes, roads and power lines, said officials. Vice Governor Glenn Soco officially declared the entire province of Cebu, including Bogo, San Remigio, Tabuelan and Medellin, ""under a State of Calamity"" on Wednesday. As cities continue to be jolted by aftershocks, here is everything to know about travelling to or from the Philippines. : Philippines earthquake latest The Philippines sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", one of the most seismically active zones on Earth, and experiences around 826 earthquakes a year. The 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Bogo City in Cebu province in the central Visayas just before 10pm local time (2pm GMT) on Tuesday, toppling buildings, cutting power and damaging a century-old church. The tremor hit hardest in northern Cebu, including San Remigio, Tabuelan and Medellin. Cebu, one of the Philippines' most popular tourist regions with a population of 3.4 million, is also home to the country's second-busiest gateway, Mactan-Cebu International Airport. The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) says: ""On 30 September 2025, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck northern Cebu, with the epicentre near Bogo City. Local authorities have reported casualties, injuries, and significant damage to infrastructure. ""Power outages and disruptions to transport and communications have been reported. Aftershocks are expected and may continue over the coming days."" It advised British nationals in the Philippines to follow the advice of local authorities, be aware of aftershocks and avoid damaged buildings. Generally, the foreign office advises against all travel to parts of the Philippines, including Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. The FCDO encourages prospective travellers to Cebu and nearby provinces to contact their travel providers and check their travel insurance covers natural disasters. Government advice also suggests tourists stay informed via the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. According to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Mactan-Cebu International Airport and other aviation hubs in Visayas were not damaged during the earthquake. Passengers were evacuated from the Mactan-Cebu terminal at 10.40pm on Tuesday following the earthquake, but were later allowed to re-enter with the airport continuing ""normal operations"". As of 12am on Wednesday, a runway inspection was ongoing at Bacolod Airport. Calbayog Airport, Hilongos Airport, Maasin Airport, Ormoc Airport, and Tacloban Airport in Eastern Visayas, after inspection, ""did not incur damages as per initial inspection"", said CAAP. As the FCDO has not warned against non-essential travel to the Philippines, there will be no special circumstances in place to cancel a trip for a full refund. The conditions for cancelling your trip will be dependent on your holiday provider, so it's best to contact them if you're looking to postpone. There is no obligation for companies to refund bookings if you want to cancel, and you will not be able to claim on your travel insurance due to safety concerns unless government advice changes. Some travel insurance policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents you from reaching your holiday destination. Check your insurance policies and speak to your insurer to see where you stand.",Yahoo,2025-10-01T10:00:58Z,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/safe-travel-philippines-foreign-office-100058211.html,2025-10-01 18:30:10.326134,-0.02745098039215688

"Tata sets new record with highest monthly sales, Nexon leads the pack","Tata Nexon set a new milestone with record-breaking sales, leading Tata Motors' passenger vehicle growth in September 2025. Tata Motors reported a strong performance in the second quarter of FY26, with both its commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles divisions registering healthy double-digit growth. The company said that the festive season boost and the rollout of GST 2.0 in late September triggered a strong revival in demand across segments, making September 2025 one of its best-ever sales months. In Q2 FY26, Tata Motors' commercial vehicle (CV) sales in domestic and international markets stood at 94,681 units, up 12% from 84,281 units in Q2 FY25. In September alone, CV sales touched 35,862 units, up 19% compared to 30,032 units in September 2024. Domestic MH&ICV sales reached 41,461 units in Q2, up from 37,372 units last year, while combined domestic and international sales for this category rose to 45,095 units, compared to 39,433 units in Q2 FY25. ""Q2 FY26 was a mixed quarter for the commercial vehicles industry, starting with subdued demand due to monsoons and GST 2.0 anticipation, but ending with a robust recovery from late September,"" said Girish Wagh, Executive Director, Tata Motors Ltd. He credited the company's rapid response in boosting product availability, refining its pricing strategy, and intensifying market activations for driving demand, particularly in the SCV and Pickup portfolio, which grew 30% YoY in September, led by the Ace Pro and Ace Gold+. Wagh added that with festive demand, rising infrastructure activity, and new product launches, Tata Motors expects ""a strong second half for FY26."" The passenger vehicles (PV) business, including EVs, reported its highest-ever quarterly sales with 144,397 units in Q2 FY26, a growth of 10% from 130,753 units in Q2 FY25. September 2025 was a landmark month, with 60,907 units sold (59,667 domestic), representing a 47% YoY growth and the company's best-ever monthly PV sales. Effective October 1, 2025, Tata Motors has demerged its Commercial Vehicles business into TML Commercial Vehicles Limited (TMLCV), while consolidating its Passenger Vehicles business under the parent entity. From October 14, 2025, after the allotment and listing of TMLCV shares, both Tata Motors and TMLCV will issue independent press releases and financial updates. With GST reforms lowering costs, festive demand strengthening, and a robust pipeline of product launches, Tata Motors said it is well-positioned for broad-based growth in H2 FY26. The company expects consumption recovery, construction, infrastructure, and mining activities to further fuel demand in both CV and PV segments.",India Today,2025-10-01T10:07:51Z,https://www.indiatoday.in/auto/latest-auto-news/story/tata-sets-new-record-with-the-highest-september-monthly-and-quarterly-sales-2796235-2025-10-01,2025-10-01 18:30:10.326599,0.3176470588235294
Here's Where Whales Are Putting Their Capital as Spot Ethereum ETFs See Biggest Outflow Since Inception,"The crypto market was caught off guard this week as spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their largest outflows since launch, signaling a sharp shift in institutional sentiment. Instead of doubling down on traditional large-cap assets, whale investors are aggressively rotating into early-stage, high-utility projects with far greater upside potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on top of that list. Priced at just $0.035, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming a whale-accumulation magnet thanks to its dual-layer lending ecosystem, and non-custodial smart contract infrastructure designed to bring institutional-grade DeFi services to retail users. With over 16,670 holders already onboarded and more than $16.6 million raised ahead of launch, MUTM represents the kind of 50x asymmetric opportunity whales look for when rotating out of overbought blue-chip assets like ETH. Ethereum faced renewed market pressure last week as U.S.-based spot ETH ETFs recorded their largest-ever weekly outflows, nearly $800 million, since launching in July 2024, according to SoSoValue data. Investor sentiment weakened as Ether's price briefly dipped below the $4,000 mark, driven by a mix of technical breakdowns, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cascading liquidations. BlackRock's flagship ETHA fund saw over $200 million in withdrawals, while Fidelity's FETH experienced a deeper $362 million outflow, highlighting waning institutional confidence in the short term. Daily outflows of around $250 million on Thursday and Friday marked the worst two-day stretch since mid-August, although ETH managed a slight rebound to trade near $4,020 by the weekend. And while investors reassess Ethereum's near-term trajectory, many are now exploring emerging opportunities in the DeFi sector, with growing attention turning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as potential higher-upside alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in the headlines as Stage 6 of its presale keeps gaining unstoppable momentum. The tokens are currently on offer at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the previous round. Investors' interest remains strong, and over 16,670 have invested in excess of $16.6 million, which suggests that confidence is growing in the project's long-term vision and potential in the DeFI market. Mutuum Finance is building a next-generation lending platform that serves both lenders and borrowers. With the support of both Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending models, the platform is secure, scalable, and accessible to both retail investors and institutional players. In addition to its revolutionary lending model, Mutuum Finance is providing a $100,000 giveaway for early adopters, where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The promotion rewards participation while highlighting the platform's commitment to open, transparent, and accessible finance. With competitive returns for both lenders and borrowers, Mutuum Finance is set to transform DeFi with its emphasis on security, efficiency, and equal access for all market participants. The protocol's security framework is built to protect users at all levels. Collateral ratios, lending caps, and deposit caps are all accurately defined to maintain a controlled and stable lending environment. Undercollateralized positions are efficiently managed by incentivized liquidations through penalties and remediation fees to stabilize the system. Collateral efficiency is optimized through tightly managed Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly for high-collateral loans. The protocol is guarded against market fluctuation by a buffer reserve, and surplus reserves are invested actively into riskier assets to neutralize fluctuations and preserve overall system stability. As spot Ethereum ETFs see record $795M outflows, whales are rotating capital into high-upside DeFi, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leading the charge. Priced at $0.035 and over 50% sold in Phase 6, MUTM has raised $16.6M with 16,670+ holders. Its dual-layer P2P and P2C lending platform, non-custodial infrastructure, and robust collateral management, including dynamic LTVs and buffer reserves, offer institutional-grade DeFi to retail investors. Combined with a $100K early-adopter giveaway, MUTM is emerging as a potential 50x asymmetric opportunity as smart money seeks alternatives to overbought ETH.

Strengthening Saksham Anganwadi for Climate Resilience,"Building resilient Anganwadis turns climate vulnerability into an opportunity for stronger, safer communities. In recent years, climate-induced disasters have frequently interrupted essential services at India's Anganwadi Centres (AWCs), risking the health and development of millions and leaving children and women at the most disproportionate end. India's vulnerability to climate change is a pressing concern, with the Economic Survey 2024-25 identifying it as the seventh most susceptible country. This underscores the urgency to protect the AWCs - government-sponsored centres that provide basic healthcare, nutrition, early childhood care, and education for children under the age of six, as well as support to pregnant and lactating mothers, and adolescent girls - against climate crisis, air pollution, and other disasters. Approximately 13.96 lakh AWCs across diverse terrains are registered under the Poshan Tracker application. The increasing frequency of climate-induced disasters -- severe floods, cyclones, and cloudbursts in places such as Wayanad, Bengaluru, Odisha, and Kerala -- has adversely affected physical infrastructure, including AWCs, disrupting services crucial to the health and well-being of their beneficiaries. Climate change is bound to worsen/widen these existing infrastructure gaps. A 2018 NITI Aayog report highlighted issues such as a lack of permanent premises, inadequate infrastructure, and essential amenities, including electricity. Furthermore, surveys also stress the absence of other necessities such as toilets, cold storage for vaccines, and other critical services. Climate change is bound to worsen/widen these existing infrastructure gaps. The latest budget identifies this lacuna and lays special emphasis on Anganwadi infrastructure. There has been a recent increase in budgetary allocation from INR 23,182.98 crore (2024-25) to INR 26,889.68 crore (2025-26) for the Ministry of Women and Child Development. A substantial portion of this budget, INR 21,960 crore, is dedicated to the Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0 initiatives, focusing on nutrition support for children and adolescent girls, early childhood care and education, and enhancing allied infrastructure. This investment in infrastructure upgradation of old and/or new centres must incorporate resilience planning to ensure long-term sustainability. The Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman, emphasised that this initiative supports 8 crore children, 1 crore pregnant and lactating women, and 20 lakh adolescent girls, particularly in aspirational districts and the Northeastern Region. Considering several AWCs are located in exposed geographies and serve vulnerable populations, including their staff, it is imperative to focus on fortifying their resilience. This approach not only safeguards physical assets, such as furniture, fixtures, digital installations, and ration supplies, but it also ensures service continuity during emergencies and enhances preparation for public health crises such as COVID-19. The National Disaster Management Guidelines - School Safety Policy have demonstrated success in mitigating loss of life and infrastructure in educational settings. This presents an opportune moment for national, state, and local authorities to collaborate on developing Anganwadi Resilience Plans (ARPs). Existing best practices, such as School Disaster Preparedness Plans or School Disaster Risk Management Plans, offer valuable frameworks that can be adapted for Anganwadis. Initiatives under the Smart Cities Mission, especially 'nurturing neighbourhood challenges' that include Anganwadi upgradations, provide additional insights into resilience building. Similarly, the refurbishment of the Anganwadi Centres project, supported by Tata Trusts in Maharashtra's Palghar district, serves as another notable example. Making AWCs resilient will strengthen the efforts of Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, thereby advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets. A coordinated effort involving the Ministries of Rural Development, Urban Affairs, Women and Child Development, along with the NDMA, can facilitate the rollout of comprehensive ARP. The initial step could involve Geographic Information System (GIS)-mapping of AWCs across rural and urban areas, capturing attributes essential for resilience planning. Some States, such as Karnataka, have undertaken AWC mapping. This data would aid in identifying the most vulnerable centres -- those in dilapidated conditions, congested locations, or areas prone to flooding -- and prioritise interventions accordingly. Incorporating AWCs within local-level planning, such as City Climate Action plans, would complement the objectives of the Saksham Anganwadi initiative, optimise resource utilisation, and build their resilience. Engaging stakeholders -- NDMA, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Forces (SDRF), volunteers, United Nations (UN) agencies, and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) -- in activities such as evacuation drills, awareness campaigns, dietary education, and emergency protocols can enhance preparedness. Furthermore, educating all constituent stakeholders, including children, parents, and adolescent girls, can foster a culture of resilience. For instance, adolescent girls, already exposed to similar initiatives in schools and communities, can act as change agents in promoting this agenda. Making AWCs resilient will strengthen the efforts of Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, thereby advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets. India's role as the Secretariat of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) offers an opportunity to leverage global expertise in developing disaster-resilient infrastructure. The success of making 13.96 lakh Anganwadis resilient can serve as a model for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) facing similar climate challenges and financial constraints. Implementing ARP will raise awareness about physical safety during emergencies and empower functionaries, including Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Helpers (AWHs), to take proactive measures. For instance, AWWs can educate beneficiaries about heatwaves and preventive actions to avoid heat strokes, as well as counsel them on nutrition and related information to safeguard against illnesses. They can also sensitise communities about seasonal diseases such as chikungunya and dengue during monsoon months. Philanthropic organisations and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives can play a pivotal role in supporting the development of resilient Anganwadi infrastructure. Resilient Anganwadi Centres are essential to safeguard children, mothers, and adolescent girls, ensuring service continuity even in the face of climate shocks. Resilient Anganwadi Centres are essential to safeguard children, mothers, and adolescent girls, ensuring service continuity even in the face of climate shocks. By closing infrastructure gaps through collaborative planning, India can advance its vision of resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development while offering a model for other climate-vulnerable nations. With government leadership complemented by philanthropy and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Anganwadis can truly stand as pillars of safety and well-being for generations to come.

Dodgy broadband is ruining phone sex and funerals - with 53% of Brits suffering problems with wifi | Wales Online,"More than half of us struggle with sketchy broadband at least twice a month - and most of us can't be bothered to do anything about it, new research has found. People reported missing out on once-in-a-lifetime concert tickets, losing job opportunities and even being unable to watch a family funeral online as a result of patchy wifi, according to a new survey from by mobile and broadband provider giffgaff. One individual told researchers their relationship ended because of constant broadband failures. And others said their phone sex sessions had been ruined when the broadband cut out. Around 53 per cent of people suffer regular problems with their wifi, listing the top frustrations as frozen work calls (17%), lost shopping orders (13%) and films or TV shows cutting out mid-stream (12%). Meanwhile, people are going to extraordinary lengths to stay connected. More than a third (36%) have left the house to find signal - heading to cafés, friends' homes, libraries and even supermarket car parks. Six per cent admitted parking outside an ex's house to use their wifi. At home, coping tactics are just as desperate. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents said they wander round the house trying to get a better signal, 17% shout at the router, and 8% drain their phone data by tethering. And some even lean out of the window hoping for a better connection. And despite so many irritated Brits taking to neighbourhood WhatsApp groups to ask ""is anyone else's Wi-Fi down?"", many refuse to switch providers - saying it's just too much faff. Almost a third (31%) say it's too much hassle to move, while a quarter think another provider wouldn't be any better. In the meantime, households are losing nearly 50 hours a year - more than a full working week - trying to fix their broadband. giffgaff says its new full fibre broadband aims to solve these problems, with three simple rolling plans starting at £34 a month, no installation fees, and symmetrical upload and download speeds. The service has already launched in parts of the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, with more areas to follow before the end of the year. Ash Schofield, CEO of giffgaff, said: ''Our research shows just how frustrating and disruptive unreliable broadband has become in people's everyday lives. It's clear that many feel stuck with a service they're not happy with. ""That's why we invited over 500 people to help shape our offering, ensuring we deliver a service that is built around what people actually want. The launch of giffgaff's full fibre broadband provides a flexible and reliable option with no fuss and no compromise.""",WalesOnline,2025-10-01T10:01:49Z,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/dodgy-broadband-ruining-phone-sex-32586318,2025-10-01 18:30:13.620995,-0.1607843137254902
Iberdrola buys 9.6-MW Molise solar project to deepen Italian push,"Iberdrola Italia acquired Montenero Green Energy Srl, owner of a 9.6-MW solar project in Molise, advancing a targeted growth strategy in southern Italy. Iberdrola's Italian arm has acquired Montenero Green Energy Srl, owner of a 9.6-MW photovoltaic project in Molise, adding a neat, near-term block of capacity in a region with solid irradiation and improving grid access. The deal fits Iberdrola's pattern in Italy: accumulate a pipeline of executable, grid-friendly assets while selectively layering corporate offtake and participating in national procurement schemes. At this scale, bankability is about repeatability. Expect a conventional utility-PV design -- high-efficiency modules on single-axis trackers or optimized fixed tilt, a DC/AC ratio tuned for annual yield, and plant controls delivering reactive power, fault ride-through, and rapid curtailment response. With Molise's agricultural footprint, developers often pair arrays with biodiversity plans -- species-rich grassland under panels, hedgerow planting at boundaries, and minimal herbicide use -- to preserve landscape character and ease municipal approvals. Commercial options are flexible. Iberdrola can contract output via corporate PPAs with regional manufacturers, participate in Italy's support mechanisms, or hold a measured merchant slice if nodal fundamentals are favorable. Co-located storage is increasingly part of the conversation: two to four hours of batteries can shift mid-afternoon generation into early evening and unlock ancillary-service revenues. Even if not built on day one, preserving substation space and transformer headroom for a future BESS retrofit is now standard practice. Grid-side, Molise benefits from proximity to stronger corridors feeding central and southern load pockets. Careful interconnection sequencing -- transformer reservations, protection settings aligned with the DSO, and staged commissioning -- helps avoid delays that have plagued some Italian sites. Post-COD, unified SCADA and predictive O&M will be key to sustaining availability and catching under-performing strings early. Strategically, the acquisition keeps Iberdrola on a pragmatic course in Italy: add compact, executable plants while pushing larger projects through permitting. In a market where execution discipline is the edge, a tidy 9.6-MW block that moves smoothly from paper to production can be worth more than a headline-grabbing giant that stalls in the queue.",List.Solar,2025-10-01T10:10:34Z,https://list.solar/news/iberdrola-buys/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.621489,0.3098039215686275

Dogecoin Price Eyes $0.50 In 2026 As Analysts Suggest This PayFi Altcoin Could Top $8 From $0.11,"The Dogecoin Price is trending as it foresees a potential jump to $0.50 in 2026, as new expectations see meme coins potentially rising in the future bull run. With its big community and solid market foundation, Dogecoin's long-term trend depends on general retail sentiment and continued mainstream exposure. Meanwhile, commentators are highlighting a fresh PayFi altcoin, Remittix (RTX), currently priced at $0.1130, as a potential star with forecasts suggesting it could hit more than $8 in the next cycle. With the intersection of cross-border payments and DeFi, Remittix marks a departure from hype coins to crypto with world utility, redefining what investors are looking for in the next big altcoin 2025. The present Dogecoin Price is $0.2302, a 0.33% decrease over the past 24 hours. It has a market capitalization of $34.68 billion with a trading volume of $2.48 billion, having grown over 30%. Even during short-term adaptations, Dogecoin remains one of the top cryptos under $1 with strong liquidity and network health. Nevertheless, analysts note that its future development will rely on actual-world adoption rather than speculation. It is because of this that investors are now eyeing upcoming crypto projects that combine innovation with real-world applications, such as Remittix, a cross-chain DeFi project that targets real-world payment problems. Remittix (RTX) at $0.1130 per token keeps breaking records in the top crypto presale category for 2025. The project has raised over $26.8 million with 673 million+ tokens sold, showing enormous investor trust. The Remittix Beta Wallet is now live, with support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Send crypto directly to bank accounts, have real-time FX conversion, and experience low gas fee crypto transactions, all from a single, easy-to-use dashboard. These features make Remittix a crypto of real utility, ideal for freelancers, remitters, and international companies seeking fast, low-fee DeFi payments. In a major industry benchmark, Remittix is NOW FULLY VERIFIED by CertiK, the world's #1 auditor of blockchain. Better still, RTX is #1 in the world for Pre-Launch Tokens -- a recognition of its security, integrity, and transparency. With BitMart listing revealed at the $20 million milestone reached and LBank finalized after hitting $22 million raised, these upcoming centralized exchange listings will boost accessibility and liquidity at launch. With its RTX token purchase incentives, deflationary tokenomics, and payment rails in the real world, Remittix places itself among the top DeFi projects of 2025. Its mix of adoption, security, and utility makes it an early-stage crypto investment to pay attention to.

Bitcoin ETF News: BlackRock Moves to Launch Premium Income Fund on Nasdaq,"The race to expand crypto investment products has entered a new chapter, with BlackRock now preparing to offer an ETF that doesn't just mirror Bitcoin's spot price but aims to generate steady cash returns. On September 30, Nasdaq lodged paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking approval to trade the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a fresh addition to the asset manager's crypto toolkit. Unlike the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which simply tracks Bitcoin itself, the new fund is structured around a covered call approach. This means investors will still have exposure to BTC through holdings in spot Bitcoin, IBIT shares, and cash, but the ETF will also sell call options on those assets or on indices that follow Bitcoin ETFs. The strategy is designed to provide a premium-style income stream -- a way to smooth out volatility and appeal to investors focused on yield. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called the product a ""sequel"" to IBIT, noting that BlackRock isn't branching into altcoin territory but rather layering Bitcoin strategies into a broader suite. That move underscores the company's conviction that investor demand will grow for multiple styles of Bitcoin exposure, from plain-vanilla spot ETFs to yield-generating versions. The SEC has acknowledged Nasdaq's request, meaning the application cleared the first technical hurdles for eligibility. From here, the agency will invite comments before making a final decision. While approval is not guaranteed, recognition under the commodity trust framework suggests the filing is being taken seriously. BlackRock only recently registered the fund in Delaware, while also adjusting filings for its existing IBIT and the iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA). Those vehicles will need to comply with generic listing standards expected to take effect in early 2026. By moving quickly, BlackRock positions itself to be first in line when regulators allow income-based crypto ETFs to launch. For investors, the filing signals that Bitcoin ETFs are no longer just about tracking prices -- they're evolving into instruments that can generate yield, diversify exposure, and potentially attract a new class of market participants.",Coindoo,2025-10-01T10:10:30Z,https://coindoo.com/bitcoin-etf-news-blackrock-moves-to-launch-premium-income-fund-on-nasdaq/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.622621,0.2862745098039217
"New online gaming law takes effect, money games banned from today","India's new Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, has banned online money games nationwide, effective Wednesday. This move aims to curb social and financial risks, including money laundering and terror financing. The industry is now pivoting towards eSports and social gaming, with the government envisioning India as a global game development hub. The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, passed by Parliament in August, came into effect on Wednesday, prohibiting online money games across the country, reported TOI. The law aims to curb social and financial risks linked to online gambling, including reports of suicides among players who suffered heavy losses. Authorities had also raised concerns about online gaming platforms being misused for money laundering and terror financing. The online gaming industry, which previously derived most of its revenue from money-based play, has begun realigning with the new legal framework. Leading players such as Dream11, Games24x7, MPL, and WinZO have discontinued money games and shifted towards eSports, social gaming, and other engagement-led formats, reported TOI. Government's push for eSports Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the new law marks a turning point for the sector. ""We have observed instances of money laundering as well as terror support. And that's why we have kept it.... This was clearly visible to the industry also. Had they taken good and effective steps to prevent the harm, obviously things would have been different,"" TOI quoted him as saying. The minister stressed that while money games are being phased out, the focus on eSports and social gaming offers new opportunities. He added that online money gaming had become a ""serious social and public health issue, with proven significant negative impact on society,"" but the industry still holds potential to help India emerge as a global hub for game development.

TotalEnergies sells half of 270-MW French wind-solar portfolio to Eiffel,"TotalEnergies has closed a deal to sell a 50% interest in a 270-MW portfolio of French wind and solar assets to Eiffel Investment Group, a transaction that exemplifies the partnership model now standard in European renewables. The oil-and-gas major keeps skin in the game and operational control, while bringing in a specialist investor with long-dated capital to share risk and accelerate growth. The portfolio mix matters. Combining solar with onshore wind delivers a smoother output profile over the year, reducing volatility and curtailment risk. Unified SCADA and analytics across the fleet enable performance tuning -- cleaning cycles, inverter setpoints, and curtailment responses -- that can lift yield by meaningful basis points. Many sites are designed with future flexibility in mind: preserved interconnection headroom and pad space for batteries that can shift energy into evening peaks and provide fast frequency response. Financially, the structure crystallizes development value while lowering the cost of capital for new projects. Eiffel gains contracted, grid-integrated assets with predictable cash flows; TotalEnergies frees balance-sheet capacity to pursue additional builds and repowerings without fully exiting operating sites. Governance frameworks typically lock in budget oversight, capex thresholds, and ESG reporting -- elements that institutional LPs increasingly require. For host communities, nothing changes day-to-day: plants keep producing, local tax receipts continue, and biodiversity plans remain in force. Over time, the partnership can fund O&M upgrades and, where justified, battery retrofits that turn renewables from energy-only resources into flexible capacity. Strategically, the deal underlines how supermajors and infrastructure funds are reshaping Europe's power sector: build at scale, share ownership, and keep optionality to adapt assets as market designs evolve. With the transition's next bottlenecks -- connection capacity and flexibility -- coming into focus, portfolios that blend technologies and investors are best placed to deliver reliable, affordable clean power.",List.Solar,2025-10-01T10:10:34Z,https://list.solar/news/totalenergies-57/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.623431,0.2627450980392156

"Are teachers ready for AI, coding, and drone tech in classrooms?","AI, Coding, and more: Are educators ready for emerging classroom tech in 2025 As chalkboards give way to coding classes and textbooks are replaced by AI tutors, the Indian education system is standing on the cusp of a historic transformation. No longer confined to rote learning or rigid syllabi, today's students are beginning to explore a dynamic world of drones, digital marketing, and real-world problem-solving skills once considered far outside the realm of school education. With the government's push for skill-based learning in Classes 11 and 12, the classroom of the future is arriving faster than we ever imagined. Global education thinkers like Harvard's Howard Gardner and Anthea Roberts predict that by 2050, schools will be hubs of personalised, tech-powered learning, tailored to each student's strengths and geared toward jobs that don't even exist yet. India's recent reforms hint at this bold future. But beneath the promise lies a pressing question: Are our teachers truly equipped to lead this change? According to the PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024, only 47 percent of schools across the country offer skill-based courses for students in Grade 9 and above. Even fewer have enroled in them. The reasons are clear: a lack of trained teachers, inadequate equipment, poor infrastructure, and a limited understanding of how to implement hands-on, experiential learning. ""This initiative is a great leap forward, but without robust teacher support and infrastructure, it risks becoming another well-intentioned idea that falls flat,"" says Monica Malhotra Kandhari, Managing Director of AASOKA by MBD Group. The goal of introducing real-world learning in schools aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasises holistic, learner-centred education. Under this new model, students can choose from a variety of courses - coding, AI, drone operation, carpentry, cooking, digital marketing, and more - intended to equip them with skills for a fast-evolving job market. ""By combining academic knowledge with skills like critical thinking, creativity, and communication, this initiative can make education more relevant and impactful,"" adds Kandhari. These programs aim to prepare students not just for exams, but for future careers, especially in a world where automation and artificial intelligence will change the nature of work. Some schools are already testing the waters. In a school in Gurugram, students have begun coding their own mini-robots and experimenting with drone flight patterns as part of a weekend enrichment program. In another school in Pune, students are learning to design mobile apps under the guidance of industry mentors. The Maharashtra government has recently launched India's first AI-powered anganwadi in Waddhamna village, Nagpur district, Maharashtra, situated around 18 km from the city. Launched by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on July 27, the anganwadi centre now uses VR headsets from Meta, AI-enabled interactive smartboards, tablets, and other digital content to learn poems, songs, and fundamental concepts. The centre aims to bridge the digital divide for rural children. Yet, such success stories are exceptions, not the norm. ""We need more schools to embrace this model, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities,"" says Alka Verma, Resident Director at Zamit, a global SkillTech organisation backed by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). Despite the enthusiasm, many teachers say they feel underprepared to teach subjects like AI, robotics, or drone operations. While over 90 percent of secondary teachers have received professional training, experts caution that such training is not always aligned with the requirements of future-ready curricula. ""We must move from traditional rote learning to a model that emphasises problem-solving, design thinking, and collaboration,"" says Verma. ""That requires re-training teachers, not just once, but continually."" A major gap lies in teacher confidence and access to up-to-date resources. Especially in rural and underserved areas, the digital divide further limits opportunities. Adding to this concern, infrastructure remains a bottleneck - even in urban centres. In a move to tackle this gap, the Delhi Cabinet recently approved a Rs 900-crore plan to install 18,996 smart boards in government schools starting July 2025. The boards will be rolled out in phases over five years, beginning with Classes 9-12, and completed by 2029-30. A teacher training module has also been cleared alongside this plan. Education Minister Ashish Sood highlighted that only 799 classrooms received smart boards between 2014 and 2024, and that too through CSR donations. Another 2,466 boards for 75 CM Shri Schools are already at the tender stage. Such investments indicate progress, but scaling this across India, particularly in rural and remote schools, remains a major challenge. ""ASER 2023 already shows a major gap in foundational literacy and numeracy among rural young people. Imagine the challenge of introducing AI and coding in such contexts,"" notes Kandhari. To successfully implement skill-based education across India, experts emphasise the need for a multipronged approach. This includes substantial investment in continuous teacher training focused on digital tools and emerging technologies. Collaborations with industry are crucial to providing students with real-world exposure and mentorship opportunities. Equally important are infrastructure upgrades, such as smart labs, modern computer systems, and reliable internet access, to support hands-on learning. Additionally, the curriculum must shift from rote memorisation to competency-based learning, supported by modern assessment methods that evaluate practical skills and project-based outcomes. ""We are at a turning point,"" says Verma. ""If we get it right, this could change the face of Indian education. If we don't, we risk leaving a generation behind,"" she adds. The road ahead for India's education system is undoubtedly promising, yet it comes with its fair share of challenges. Skill-based learning is not just another subject on the curriculum; it represents a transformative shift in mindset, teaching, and learning. Success will hinge on thoughtful planning, robust support systems, and continuous training for educators. By nurturing curiosity, fostering practical skills, and bridging the gap between theory and real-world application, India can empower its students not merely to excel in exams but to thrive in life. With bold vision, collaborative effort, and unwavering commitment, the nation has a unique opportunity to shape a generation equipped for both the challenges of higher education and the demands of the modern world.",India Today,2025-10-01T09:55:59Z,https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/ai-coding-and-more-are-educators-ready-for-emerging-classroom-tech-in-2025-2796205-2025-10-01,2025-10-01 18:30:13.625410,0.04313725490196085
Robinhood Eyes Europe Expansion as CEO Boasts $4B Prediction Contracts in Q3 - Blockonomi,"Robinhood aims to extend its fast-growing prediction market business beyond the US, Bloomberg has reported. Robinhood is preparing its biggest push outside the United States yet. The trading app wants to extend its prediction markets to Europe. Talks are already happening with UK and EU regulators. The move comes after rapid growth in its prediction business. Bloomberg reported the expansion discussions are underway. CEO Vlad Tenev revealed Robinhood Prediction Markets has crossed $4 billion in all-time event contracts. He said over $2 billion was traded in the third quarter alone. The trading boom has caught industry attention. Tenev stated this is only the beginning for the platform's expansion. Bloomberg reported that Robinhood has been discussing its plans with the UK's Financial Conduct Authority. The firm wants to understand how to structure these markets under European law. Unlike the US, where they are treated as futures products, in Europe they are often regulated as gambling. This creates challenges that the company will need to navigate carefully. The expansion comes at a time when demand for prediction markets is growing globally. Traders see them as a new way to bet on outcomes like elections and sports. Robinhood appears ready to tap into that interest outside the US. Its global growth push will depend on regulatory clarity. Robinhood's talks with regulators are ongoing. The company is examining how these markets can comply with local frameworks. Each country in Europe takes a different approach. Some classify them as betting, while others treat them more like financial products. For Robinhood, the challenge is more than compliance. It's about how users will access and trust the platform in new regions. The UK and EU offer large potential user bases, but also stricter oversight. Regulators will want clear consumer protections in place before granting approval. Robinhood's entry could reshape how prediction markets are used in Europe. Other platforms operate in the space, but few have Robinhood's scale. If approval is granted, the rollout could come quickly. The discussions mark an early step in a wider push.",Blockonomi,2025-10-01T10:09:45Z,https://blockonomi.com/robinhood-eyes-europe-expansion-as-ceo-boasts-4b-prediction-contracts-in-q3/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.625816,0.09019607843137245

What You Need to Know About Annuities,"A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end.",Financial Post,2025-10-01T10:08:17Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/what-you-need-to-know-about-annuities,2025-10-01 18:30:13.626445,0.06666666666666665
[Executive Corner] Leading the Game: How LG Became Spain's #1 in Professional LED Technology at Sports Venues,"(BPT) - By Jaime de Jaraíz, president of LG Electronics Iberia When fans walk into a stadium, they expect more than just a game or a show -- they expect to feel part of something bigger. In Spain, this new era of immersive sports and entertainment has two shining examples: the Riyahd Air Metropolitano in Madrid and the Roig Arena in Valencia. At both venues, we at LG are helping write a new chapter in the digital transformation of sports, leading a technological revolution that redefines how every moment is experienced. What sets us apart is not only our leadership as the No. 1 provider of professional LED technology in Spain,* but also our ability to turn every project into a unique digital ecosystem. We don't just install screens -- we create living platforms where image, software and infrastructure work together to make every corner of a venue come alive. Riyahd Air Metropolitano: An Icon in Transformation In Madrid, our collaboration with Atlético de Madrid has transformed the Riyahd Air Metropolitano into a stadium that breathes innovation. The exterior and interior now form a dynamic canvas of light and color, amplifying the atmosphere of every moment. At the top, our state-of-the-art Mesh LED envelops the stadium in a 360-degree visual spectacle, amplifying the excitement of every goal and every play and making the roar of the fans even more powerful and unforgettable. Roig Arena: A New Global Benchmark In Valencia, the Roig Arena was envisioned as one of the most advanced arenas in the world. At the heart stands our technological gem: the high-resolution video scoreboard. This giant screen, bearing the LG seal of innovation, offers precise sharpness and color uniformity that allow every replay, every stat and every detail of the game to be seen with astonishing clarity throughout the stands. But it does much more than display scores -- it syncs with lighting, sound and dynamic content to turn every key moment into a cinematic experience. Around it, the perimeter LED ribbon and the iconic outdoor screen, The Eye, complete a digital ecosystem that extends the excitement beyond the venue, placing Valencia at the forefront of Europe as a venue for top-level competitions and events. Digitalization as a Driver of Change In both Madrid and Valencia, we're showing that digitalizing stadiums isn't just about impressive visuals -- it's about smarter management, new ways to communicate and deeper connections with audiences. These venues are flexible platforms that can adapt to matches, concerts, cultural shows or corporate events. And for sponsors, they open new doors to engage with the public in more personal, real-time ways. Shaping the Future Through Leadership In recent years, we've been proud to contribute to nearly thirty sports venues in Spain, from stadiums and arenas to the Rafa Nadal Academy and local gyms. With a 45% share of the professional LED market in Spain in the first quarter of 2025,* and the trust of eight out of 10 major Spanish stadiums, we are not just equipping venues -- we are redefining the live event experience. However, this leadership isn't built on technology alone. It comes from people -- the talent, passion and dedication of nearly 240 professionals at LG Spain. From engineering to sales, logistics to marketing, every department has played a vital role in making these projects a reality. Each installation is a milestone that brings Spain a little closer to the global forefront of sports and entertainment technology. Our expertise also extends beyond Spain, to iconic venues like Wembley Stadium in London, Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt and Jan Breydel Stadium in Belgium. At LG, we believe life is richer when emotions are lived intensely. That's why our mission is to make every fan, in every seat, feel that Life's Good -- and why we believe the future of sports and entertainment venues is already here. *Source: OMDIA.

"Air France, Airbus back on trial for doomed Rio-Paris flight","Air France and aircraft manufacturer Airbus are back in court to face an appeal against their 2023 acquittal on charges of corporate manslaughter related to the 2009 crash of flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, which killed all 228 people on board. The crash occurred on June 1, 2009, when the plane went into an aerodynamic stall over the Atlantic after its speed sensors (pitot tubes) became blocked by ice crystals. French investigators concluded the pilots mishandled the loss of data and failed to respond to alerts, leading the plane to plunge. The companies primarily blamed pilot error. In 2023, a lower court cleared both companies of criminal responsibility, ruling that while they had committed negligent acts, these acts could not be proven to have directly caused the accident. Airbus was cited for four negligent acts, including withholding information about the problematic sensors. At the same time, Air France was accused of negligence in communicating technical information about the faulty equipment to its pilots. Prosecutors filed an appeal under pressure from the victims' families, who argue that the companies knew about the sensor problems and failed to provide the crew with adequate high-altitude emergency training. The appeal trial started this week and is scheduled to run through November 27. If convicted, the companies face fines of €225,000 each, in addition to significant reputational damage. Air France Flight 447 (AF447) was a scheduled international passenger flight from Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport in Brazil to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in France. On June 1, 2009, the Airbus A330-203 (registration F-GZCP) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 600 miles (965 km) off the northeastern coast of Brazil, killing all 228 people on board -- 216 passengers and 12 crew members. It remains one of the deadliest aviation disasters in Air France's history and the worst involving an Airbus A330. The incident highlighted vulnerabilities in high-altitude stall recovery, automation dependency, and sensor reliability, leading to global changes in pilot training and aircraft design.",MercoPress,2025-10-01T10:01:00Z,https://en.mercopress.com/2025/10/01/air-france-airbus-back-on-trial-for-doomed-rio-paris-flight,2025-10-01 18:30:13.627916,-0.592156862745098

"Hungarian camel milk expertise is on its way to Chad, and this is no joke at all","The National Exhibition of Agriculture and the Food Industry (OMÉK) was held last week at Budapest's Hungexpo, where, in addition to displaying agricultural machinery and products of small-scale producers, companies working in the sector and institutions involved in agriculture also set up stands. Among others, a two-member Kenyan delegation also arrived here on Saturday to discuss the Kenyan demonstration farm which had been announced by Minister of Agriculture István Nagy last March. However, this project is just one of a series of international collaborations launched by the Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, (MATE) aiming to open the door for Hungarian agrotechnology companies to distant markets, while also strengthening the institution's own ties in the countries concerned. MATE has also launched a similar partnership in Chad, where it plans to transfer Hungarians' surprisingly extensive knowledge on camels to the Chadians by establishing a center for camel husbandry and camel milk production. But let's begin with the demonstration farm in Kenya: when it was first announced, the Ministry of Agriculture said that under the project, researchers would be testing seeds and cultivation technologies in the Kenyan town of Mwea. This was not the only project of this kind over the past few years: in 2021, a demonstration farm was established in the Philippines, mainly for rice breeding, followed by a demonstration farm in Chad in 2023, but the Uzbek-Hungarian Potato Research Center, founded in Tashkent in 2021, which at first sounded funny to many, was also established. The Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, which oversees these projects, has other international partnerships as well. For example, they have launched a joint project with Kazakhstan to introduce a variety of Hungarian seeds to the local market. In Azerbaijan, they have established a training center, while in April they held talks with Kyrgyzstan about launching a cooperation in education and innovation. According to Csaba Gyuricza, the rector of MATE, in the 21st century, the emphasis has shifted from selling products to selling the technology itself, meaning that ""they are not exporting the screw, but rather building the assembly plant there."" Although there have been similar state-supported projects for exporting know-how, according to Gyuricza, it was after MATE's restructuring in 2020 that this type of collaboration really took off. This was when the University of Kaposvár, the Gyöngyös Campus of the Eszterházy Károly University, and the Georgikon Faculty of Pannon University joined MATE, and according to Gyuricza, since then they have succeeded in establishing a presence in more and more countries. In recent years, quite a number of agricultural cooperation projects similar to those mentioned above have been launched in places which seem relatively far from Hungary. When reading about them, one might well ask: why does Hungary have such projects, and what exactly do the parties involved gain from them? According to Kennedy Nzioka, who is in charge of the Kenyan demonstration farm, on the one hand, since nearly 60 percent of Kenya's population of 56 million make their living from farming, their goal is to promote types of vegetables and fruits that would yield a higher harvest than the ones currently grown. On the other hand, just as it does everywhere else in the world, global warming is affecting the climate in Kenya too, so they need to prepare for the future with varieties that can withstand more extreme weather than the ones being used right now. A study published by the World Meteorological Organization indicated that Africa is warming up more rapidly than the global average, with the average temperature in 2023 being 0.6 degrees higher than the average measured between 1990 and 2020. In order to prepare for this, they will need to import a variety of plants from abroad that are suitable for the expected local weather conditions. This doesn't sound too difficult in theory: the Kenyan delegation looks around abroad, takes home some seeds of different varieties of corn, peppers, and tomatoes, and then sees which ones can produce the most yield. In reality, however, it is a much more complicated process, often requiring the assistance of foreign institutions even in identifying the various local plant species. Moreover, it is not enough to simply plant a seed; it usually needs to be ""fine-tuned"" through a bit of breeding so that it can adapt to the local environment -- and all this is much more difficult to do successfully without the expertise of the researchers who have already been experimenting with the seed in question. According to László Máthé, chief advisor to the rector of the Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, these are the exact things the demonstration farm can provide a platform for, where - under the supervision of MATE researchers - they can examine the seeds and thus determine which Hungarian seeds are best suited to the Kenyan climate. Additionally, given that the Kenyans may also be looking elsewhere when searching for the most suitable varieties, the fact that - as part of the cooperation - the Hungarians are also offering to help adapt and breed the plants could give them a competitive advantage over seeds from other countries. While the members of the Hungarian research team generally take turns working at the Kenyan demonstration farm, the university staff mostly monitor the project from Hungary. The Uzbek-Hungarian Potato Research Center was a similar endeavour, with the Uzbek side footing the bill for the project. With the Kenyan project, once they have found the Hungarian varieties suitable for the local climate, they will be propagated, and the university may even earn a profit from the license fees for the stecklings sold afterwards. At the Kenyan demonstration farm, MATE negotiated a lease agreement for the plot with a local partner, so there was relatively little infrastructure development required, with the maintenance costs also being covered by the Hungarians. While the costs of the project may also yield a quick return here from the license fees for the stecklings, László Máthé believes that these collaborations may have two even more important benefits. One of these is that it is relatively difficult for Hungarian companies working in agriculture to take on projects of this size on their own. Additionally, Africa's population is growing rapidly, and according to the World Bank, the number of people living on the continent could reach 2.5 billion by 2050 and 4.5 billion by the end of the century. It is therefore clear that there will be an even greater need for food than before. To this end, the development of agriculture is inevitable in the long term, whether through introducing previously unused crop varieties or improving technologies such as irrigation and fertilization. All the Hungarian companies working in the field of agricultural technology would be keen to get involved in this potentially lucrative project, but doing so is not that simple: the Hungarian party doesn't always know who to look for in the given market, while the African party may not necessarily trust a company from so far away. This is why a cooperation such as the one conducted by MATE in these countries can be beneficial, as it gives Hungarian companies which are unknown in the relevant market someone to seek guidance from, while at the same time increasing the credibility of the company in the eyes of Kenyan farmers if they come in with the backing of MATE, which has been collaborating with their government. These projects may thus open up new markets for Hungarian agri-tech companies. For example, during their visit to OMÉK, the Kenyan delegation reached an agreement with a Hungarian company about testing their fertiliser enriched with minerals at the demonstration farm, but according to Kennedy Nzioka, they also held talks with a Hungarian manufacturer of agricultural and industrial drones about potentially using their drones for spraying and inspecting their crops from above. Of course, having a technology tested at a demonstration farm does not automatically mean that the product will become widely used throughout the Kenyan market, but it can be a good starting point, and if it proves to be effective, it will be easier for Kenyan farmers to access it through the Hungarian plants that have been bred and propagated at the demonstration farm. According to László Máthé, they have recently recorded good results with a variety of watermelon, a hot pepper, and two other types of pepper, so the next step is registering them so that the seeds can be sold on the local market. The cooperation on the Kenyan demonstration farm is due to end at the end of 2025, but the university would like to launch new collaborations with the African country as a continuation of this one. Although the project is still in its early stages, MATE's plans for the demonstration farm in Chad are even bigger than those for Kenya: last summer, the Hungarian Dairy Research Institute (MTKI), which is affiliated with the university, announced that they would participate in establishing a Center of Excellence for Breeding Camels and Processing Camel Milk in Chad. Under the supervision of MATE, here they will study the handling and processing of camel milk, for which a processing plant will also be built. The foundation stone for the center was laid this summer, and according to László Máthé, construction can begin in November, with the costs being covered by the Hungarian side. The training of Chadian experts has already begun, but the actual work at the facility is expected to start next summer, with its maintenance being financed by the university's local partner, the Chadian Animal Husbandry Research Institute. Ever since people started recognizing the benefits of consuming camel milk, it has started appearing on the shelves of more and more Western European stores. As it turns out, it contains less saturated fat than cow's milk, and contains more vitamin C and B, and calcium. It can lower the blood sugar level, and according to some studies, it can also help boost the immune system. Another huge advantage is that it doesn't contain lactose, so people who are lactose intolerant may also consume it. However, due to the challenges of raising camels, its price is much higher. While on average, a cow produces up to 28 liters of milk per day, a camel provides only 2-7 liters. Additionally, it is essential to keep the males around as well, which can increase the price of camel milk to more than twenty times that of cow's milk. In spite of this, the market for this product has been growing year by year, reaching an estimated $14.1 billion in 2023, with some studies predicting an annual growth rate of 9.4 percent through 2030. This might prove especially beneficial for Chad, as the country is home to the world's biggest camel population, with almost 10 million animals living there. The Central African country hasn't really managed to take advantage of this until now, as despite its huge stock of camels, it hasn't even made it into the top five camel milk producing countries. Incidentally, Chad has received special attention in Hungarian foreign policy in recent years: in November 2023, parliament voted to deploy 200 Hungarian troops to the country which lies on one of the migration routes from Africa to Europe, as part of a military mission aiming to curb the activities of human traffickers facilitating migration. The President of Chad, Mahamat Déby - who took over power from his father in 2021 - was the one who initially approached Hungary with a request to help bolster the capabilities of the Chadian army. This is what eventually led to the planning of the military project with the secret involvement of Viktor Orbán's son. The starting date of the mission is still unknown, however, as Chad suspended negotiations with the Hungarian government in June. It may come as a surprise at first, but the world's largest camel farm, called Camelicious, located on the outskirts of Dubai, was built under the professional guidance of Hungarian researchers. Veterinarians Péter Nagy and Judit Juhász set up the farm, which is now home to around 9,000 camels, in 2006 at the request of the sheikh of Dubai. The researchers have accumulated a wealth of experience and contacts in the industry, so it is also partly thanks to Péter Nagy that MTKI has been awarded some contracts. The institute began its collaboration with Camelicious in 2012, thus acquiring a considerable amount of knowledge in the field of camel husbandry and milk processing over the past 13 years. They are now looking to export the model used by Camelicious to Chad, where they would assist with both the mechanization of milking and the operation of the equipment used for this, while also providing solutions for the Chadians for both camel husbandry and milk processing. At present, a nomadic form of camel husbandry is typical in the country, where the animals roam and graze freely. The goal now is to transform this traditional form of husbandry into a more systematic, intensive form of breeding, which will also allow for a closer observation and care of the animals. According to László Máthé, with proper husbandry and feeding, the daily milk yield of one camel could be increased to 10-15 liters, but MATE also has plans to breed a herd of camels that produce more milk than the animals currently do. They intend to do this through re-breeding at the demonstration farm. According to the plans, in addition to income from the sale of camel milk, the center could also generate revenue from selling the animals bred there, while one of MATE's main goals would be to continue its research on camels so that it could then share the knowledge gained with even more countries. According to László Máthé, the experience Hungarian researchers have gained over the last several years is already attracting international attention, and several countries with significant camel populations have approached the university with various proposals for cooperation. In addition to Chad, there could also be joint projects with Kazakhstan and Mongolia in the future. In addition to this, through their new contacts, they would also be able to introduce Hungarian companies to the Chadian market, for example, through the sale of technologies needed for feeding the animals. According to Csaba Gyuricza, education, research and development, and economic activities tend to be closely linked in agriculture: for example, there are students from 113 different countries at their university, so it is fairly common for students who return home after completing their studies to take up positions that enable them to facilitate cooperation between the two countries. However, these projects are far from being risk-free, as there is no guarantee that the invested money will pay off in the long run. It may be that even after several years of work, a project will still fail to produce results. Furthermore, the fact that other countries are also engaged in such cooperation may hinder the success of Hungarian technology: Csaba Gyuricza highlighted the Dutch and the Germans at the international level, while regionally it is the Poles who are achieving particularly good results. He also singled out the Japanese and the Chinese as performing well in this respect. These are typically the countries that may be Hungary's biggest competitors, as they are entering the local markets with significant capital and know-how, and often with already developed systems. In such cases, the Hungarian party, operating with less funding, may not be able to compete with them, and its technology may eventually be forced out of the market. This is why, according to the rector, it is worth taking the opportunity to target various niche markets and focus the cooperation efforts on areas which tend to be overlooked by other countries and in which Hungarian agriculture is fundamentally strong: one example of this could be Hungarian potatoes - which are more drought-tolerant and disease-resistant than their Western counterparts - being cultivated in Uzbekistan. According to László Máthé, in addition to agriculture, water management projects may also be a good entry point into certain African countries, which could then lead to further cooperation in the future.",telex,2025-10-01T10:10:23Z,https://telex.hu/english/2025/10/01/hungarian-camel-milk-expertise-is-on-its-way-to-chad-and-this-is-no-joke-at-all,2025-10-01 18:30:13.631042,0.2705882352941176

World Liberty Financial Bridges Traditional Markets with Blockchain,"Regulatory progress is occurring for blockchain securities in the U.S. Summarize the content using AI ChatGPT Grok World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by the Trump family, unveiled its ambitious plan on October 1 at the Token2049 event in Singapore. The company aims to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) with the blockchain by tokenizing commodities such as oil, natural gas, cotton, and timber. WLFI intends to connect decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional markets through its USD1, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. According to reports, WLFI's CEO, Zach Witkoff, emphasized that executing commodity transactions on the blockchain could enhance efficiency. ContentsThe Scope of WLFI's RWA StrategyDevelopments on the Regulatory Front The Scope of WLFI's RWA Strategy The company's roadmap focuses on dividing commodity-based instruments into tokens, thereby enabling access to a broader investor base and facilitating immediate settlement in secondary markets. Witkoff highlighted the potential of oil, gas, cotton, and timber as candidates within their asset basket. The implementation of a blockchain-based trade and settlement system could improve operational efficiency. Furthermore, the event saw the introduction of WLFI's card solutions, which aim to integrate tokenization into commercial transactions with the USD1 stablecoin playing a crucial role as a unit of account. The USD1 stablecoin is described as a dollar-pegged asset secured by U.S. Treasury bonds and cash-like securities. The design enables USD1 to operate across various networks, promising transparency in institutional payments and custodial processes. Initial launch details were revealed during the spring season. Developments on the Regulatory Front During the Singapore event, SEC member Hester Peirce expressed the agency's enthusiasm for collaborating with parties interested in tokenization, calling for dialogue with the industry. Peirce's statements were perceived as an indication of a softened stance from the U.S. regarding RWAs and blockchain-based securities. Infrastructure advancements for tokenized securities in the U.S. market are progressing rapidly. Notably, Nasdaq has submitted formal requests for rule amendments to facilitate trading in tokenized securities. These proposed changes are documented within SEC filings, potentially allowing traditional and blockchain-based settlement alternatives to coexist.

"Scary Video Of Yamuna Expressway: Speeding At Nearly 300 Kmph, Biker Escapes Deadly Crash By...","The Yamuna Expressway witnessed a shocking incident, as a Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R rider raced the superbike at a speed of 300 kmph and nearly collided with a truck. In a video that stunned everyone over social media, this superbike rider exhibited alarming carelessness for his own and other travellers' safety. The bike rider narrowly escaped a fatal accident, missing the truck coming in their path by a fraction of a second. Such reckless driving sparked outrage on the internet and raised serious concerns over public safety on the usually busy expressway. Reckless Ninja ZX-10R Rider The Yamuna Expressway, which is a 165.5 km long expressway in Uttar Pradesh connecting Greater Noida with Agra, is India's sixth-longest expressway. Despite its great connectivity and extended stretch, the Yamuna Expressway has also been a centre of deadly collisions and accidents. It makes reckless driving there a strict no-no for all travellers. But this Ninja ZX-10R rider looked unperturbed about the potential dangers and kept racing his superbike. Stacked with a 998 CC engine, 203 PS @ 13200 rpm max power, 12 kmpl mileage, 17 litres fuel capacity and a top speed of 299 kmph, the Ninja ZX-10R is one of the most popular sports superbikes in India that has attracted many automobile enthusiasts, who are willing to pay its ex-showroom price of Rs 17,93,000. But the superbike is not meant for regular roads and highways. Auto experts have reportedly advised motorcyclists to take such superbikes out only on professional tracks. What The Internet Felt About The Incident Even as the video exposed the Ninja ZX-10R rider's unethical road behaviour, many on social media also noted how the truck coming from the other side took an ""illegal"" U-turn and almost jammed into the bike. ""So no one's gonna talk about the illegal u turn the truck took?"" said one user. Someone else said, ""Illegal U Turn by Truck, you can always see people on highways doing this type of U turn every where in India. It's become too normal that they forget what's the rule to take U turn."" Another person, though, kept their scrutiny mainly on the driver. ""Yes the truck took an illegal turn. BUT if the biker was so far, how could the truck driver see. It's basic math. The biker was doing 299. So when the truck decided to turn, he was pretty far to see in the rear view mirror. I ain't backing the truck driver but it is what it is. I'm sure he couldn't see the biker,"" the individual said. Regardless of who was at fault, the incident should certainly alert the authorities and pave the way for increased surveillance on expressways to penalise overspeeding.",News18,2025-10-01T10:07:53Z,https://www.news18.com/viral/scary-video-of-yamuna-expressway-speeding-at-nearly-300-kmph-biker-escapes-deadly-crash-by-9608347.html,2025-10-01 18:30:13.632583,-0.1843137254901961
Why ProfitableMining is a leading investor choice in market,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With high hardware costs and rising electricity prices pushing retail investors out of traditional mining, ProfitableMining positions itself as a reliable option in the 2025 cloud mining reshuffle. With the intensified global hashrate competition, the cloud mining industry entered a new round of reshuffle in 2025. Traditional mining machines are no longer suitable for average investors due to high hardware costs, rising electricity costs, and difficult operations and maintenance. Cloud mining, with its ""rental computing power, easy mining, and automatic settlement"" model, has once again become a focus of global investors. However, with the numerous cloud mining platforms on the market and varying quality, choosing a legitimate, transparent, and reliable platform is a challenge for investors. Amid this, one platform stands out: ProfitableMining. Among many platforms, ProfitableMining not only strikes a balance between profitability and security, but also offers investors a long-term, sustainable investment path. Comparing the cloud mining industry in 2025, ProfitableMining is a top choice for investors due to its revenue structure, transparent fee structure, and global green energy footprint. For investors seeking long-term, passive income in the cryptocurrency market, ProfitableMining is undoubtedly a path worth considering.",crypto.news,2025-10-01T10:10:02Z,https://crypto.news/why-profitablemining-is-a-leading-investor-choice-in-the-market/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.632813,0.08235294117647052
Living the dream: Aiken resident launches fantasy sports advisory firm,"AIKEN -- Scott Hoyt's involvement in fantasy sports started as a hobby and then evolved into a passion. Over the years, his interest continued to grow and eventually it led to Hoyt's decision to start a business. Oct. 1 was the launch date of that new venture, Fantasy Sports Strategies, which is an advisory firm. Hoyt said his plan is to help startups and small companies ""that don't have the strategic mindset to kind of take the next big step in developing new products and new services within the fantasy sports industry."" He began participating in fantasy sports in 1989. ""I was in the middle of building my career in corporate marketing, and I accepted what I thought was a casual invitation to join a fantasy football league,"" Hoyt said. ""As someone who has always been immersed in sports, I thought it would be nothing more than a fun extension of that enthusiasm. But what I didn't realize then was that fantasy sports would become a defining part of my life."" In 2007, Hoyt won $150,000 in a national fantasy football contest. He is member of the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association and serves on the organization's Membership and Public Relations committees. At the local level, ""I'm the commissioner of a fantasy football league in Woodside for a bunch of my fellow golfers and friends,"" Hoyt said. He and his wife, Teresa, first moved here from northern Virginia in 2020. They then spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona, before returning to South Carolina in July of this year. ""It's a place that continues to draw us in,"" said Hoyt of Aiken. ""It's a great community, and I think community drives happiness in your life. I also think that Aiken represents a slower pace for us. We're able to do the things we want to do without the pressures of being in urban sprawl."" Hoyt has retired from his career at the executive level in corporate marketing. He held leadership roles with companies such as IBM, AT&T and Proctor & Gamble. His experience as a corporate marker, Hoyt believes, will be valuable in his role as the CEO of Fantasy Sports Strategies. ""I want to leverage the decades of marketing experience that I have and combine it with my passion for fantasy sports to support others so they can pursue their own dreams,"" Hoyt said. ""Honestly, this isn't something that I am going to make a lot of money doing. I'm doing it to help my clients grow and contribute to the industry. That's what is meaningful to me."" According to mordorintelligence.com, the fantasy sports industry has a market size of $37.48 billion and that is projected to increase to $71.24 billion by 2030. ""I saw there was a little bit of opportunity and a void for someone like myself,"" Hoyt said. ""I'm really excited about launching this [business]. I'm taking a passion and turning into something that is more meaningful.""

"Tokenwell Launches Retail Crypto App in US, Expands to Europe","Tokenwell must navigate volatility, regulatory risk, and competition to scale successfully. Tokenwell has launched a new retail-focused crypto investing application in the US, enabling non-institutional investors to access curated crypto baskets. The company also announced plans to enter Europe, beginning with Germany, to broaden its geographic footprint. Tokenwell Platforms Inc. has launched a crypto investing app for retail users in the US. The app provides access to professionally designed baskets of digital assets. These baskets were previously available only to accredited and institutional investors. The app is now available via the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This launch follows Tokenwell's acquisition of WealthAgile Inc., which supports its infrastructure for managing diversified baskets. By promoting portfolio models with built-in diversification, Tokenwell aims to reduce entry barriers for everyday investors in the crypto space. Underlying risk management and rebalancing measures are expected to play a role in maintaining the integrity of these baskets, though the firm has provided limited public detail on algorithmic weighting criteria or liquidity thresholds. Observers note that the challenge will be to balance accessibility with robust safeguards against volatility inherent in crypto markets. Tokenwell's launch reflects a broader fintech trend. Platforms are increasingly aiming to democratize access to complex investment strategies. If successful, these offerings could boost participation in the digital asset market. However, they also raise questions about disclosure, user education, and regulatory compliance. In parallel with its US launch, Tokenwell has announced intentions to expand into Europe, starting with Germany as its primary entry point. Germany is often regarded as one of Europe's more crypto-friendly jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The company has engaged Dr. Sheldon Levy as a strategic advisor to support its phased rollout across European markets. The expansion plan appears calibrated: Tokenwell intends to navigate local licensing, compliance, and customer acquisition ahead of scaling to other countries. Its choice of Germany could serve as a testing ground for broader EU operations, allowing the firm to adapt to region-specific rules such as MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation) and national supervisory regimes. However, Tokenwell faces competition from established European crypto platforms and investment apps that already have traction. Success in Europe will demand robust localization -- language, fiat on-ramps, partnerships with local banking systems, and adherence to anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Despite the promise, Tokenwell faces significant industry headwinds. Crypto markets are inherently volatile, regulatory regimes are evolving rapidly, and trust remains fragile among retail investors exposed to digital assets. The company will need transparent risk disclosures and strong backtesting or stress-testing of its basket models to engender confidence. Regulators in both the US and Europe are intensifying scrutiny of platforms that package crypto products for retail clients. Questions may arise over whether these baskets qualify as securities, or whether they require additional oversight, disclosures, or licensing. Tokenwell must proactively engage with regulatory bodies to mitigate legal and compliance risks. On the growth front, if Tokenwell can scale user adoption while managing asset flows and operational complexity, it might carve out a niche as a low-friction gateway for retail crypto investing. Partnerships with banking or payment providers could further reduce friction. Still, margin pressures, custodial costs, and competitive pricing will be critical elements in determining whether the app becomes sustainable long-term.",BeInCrypto,2025-10-01T10:10:14Z,https://beincrypto.com/tokenwell-unveils-retail-crypto-app-in-us-eyes-entry-into-europe/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.633786,0.2
"Bitcoin ETFs Surge, Propelling Bitcoin Beyond $116,000","Analysts speculate potential Bitcoin peaks after technical analysis of market trends. Summarize the content using AI ChatGPT Grok On the last trading day of September, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin $114,168 ETFs attracted a net inflow of $430 million in a single day. Over the two trading days of the week, the total inflow into these ETFs surpassed $950 million. This strong resurgence in institutional demand stabilized the spot price and pushed Bitcoin above the $116,000 threshold. Following the dip to $108,000 last week, buying volumes intensified. The federal government shutdown reported on October 1st, due to the budget impasse in Washington, also highlighted Bitcoin as a refuge asset amid risk aversion. ContentsETFs and Safe Haven Perception Strengthen the MarketTechnical Outlook for Bitcoin and Analyst Comments ETFs and Safe Haven Perception Strengthen the Market Inflows into ETFs have reversed the outflow trend observed last week, indicating a renewed appetite among investors. The inability of the U.S. government to approve the funding package, leading to the shutdown, resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent on mandatory leave, making markets price in political risk. Unions and policy analysts recalled the 35-day shutdown during the 2018-2019 period, highlighting potential pressure on household budgets. The U.S. government shutdown accelerated a shift towards scarce assets like gold and Bitcoin. While precious metal prices reached new highs, the dollar weakened. Analyst Ted pointed to the high correlation with gold, noting Bitcoin's delayed response. He mentioned that new records in gold could form an upward trend in the largest cryptocurrency in the fourth quarter of the year, albeit with a potential for correction amid the generally positive outlook. Technical Outlook for Bitcoin and Analyst Comments The reaction from the dip to $108,000 last week, coupled with ETF-induced inflows, alleviated short-term pressure on Bitcoin. While the market remains prone to high volatility, the motivation to avoid risk is expected to strengthen if the government shutdown is prolonged. Observed indicators suggest that the spot side is supported by institutional accumulation. Experienced cryptocurrency analyst Cas Abbe noted the potential for new peaks in October. Meanwhile, Captain Faibik conveyed that the descending parallel channel, observed since August, might break within the next two months. If confirmed by an increase in volume, such a scenario could make technical record-seeking possible in the last quarter of the year.

"Sensex snaps 8-day losing streak, investors earn  ₹4 lakh crore in a day --  10 key highlights from Indian stock market | Stock Market News","Stock market today: The Sensex ended the day 716 points, or 0.89 per cent, higher at 80,983.31, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,836.30, up 225 points, or 0.92 per cent. The Indian stock market benchmarks -- the Sensex and the Nifty 50 -- snapped their eight-day losing streak on Wednesday, October 1, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projected healthy growth-inflation dynamics for the country while keeping the repo rate and policy stance unchanged. The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) of the RBI voted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.50 per cent and also decided to continue with the neutral stance. It was the second consecutive meeting of status quo on interest rates, which experts believe has set the stage for a rate cut in the next policy meeting in December. The Sensex ended the day 716 points, or 0.89 per cent, higher at 80,983.31, while the Nifty 50 settled at 24,836.30, up 225 points, or 0.92 per cent. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices also clocked healthy gains of 0.91 per cent and 1.16 per cent, respectively. An across-the-board buying lifted the overall market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms to over ₹455.5 lakh crore from ₹451.44 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors richer by more than ₹4 lakh crore in a single session.

CoinShares to Acquire FCA-Regulated Bastion to Boost Active Crypto Strategies | Altcoin UK | CryptoRank.io,"European digital asset manager CoinShares is set to acquire Bastion Asset Management, a UK-based, FCA-regulated firm known for its systematic crypto investment strategies. The acquisition, announced Wednesday, is part of CoinShares' push to expand its actively managed offerings and accelerate growth in the US market. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it remains subject to regulatory approval. Bastion specializes in market-neutral and quantitative strategies for institutional clients. Once approved, its full team, including CEO Philip Scott and CIO Fred Desobry, will integrate into CoinShares, bolstering its expertise in systematic digital asset investing. CoinShares, primarily recognized for its passive exchange-traded crypto products, sees the acquisition as key to broadening its platform into a one-stop shop that blends passive exposure with active management. The move also strengthens CoinShares' position in the US, where its Investment Advisor license allows it to offer regulated products. With Bastion's quantitative strategies in-house, CoinShares plans to launch actively managed crypto funds tailored for institutional investors navigating volatile markets. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti called the acquisition ""perfectly aligned"" with the firm's goal of building a comprehensive digital asset investment suite. Bastion co-founder Philip Scott said the deal would help scale its investor base and accelerate the development of alternative strategies. With Bastion's track record and CoinShares' infrastructure, the combined platform aims to serve a broader range of institutional clients with both yield-generating and market-hedging solutions. As reported, CoinShares will go public in the U.S. through a $1.2 billion SPAC merger with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. The deal will create a new entity, Odysseus Holdings Limited, and is expected to close by Q4 2025. The move positions CoinShares among the world's largest publicly listed crypto asset managers, with $10 billion in AUM. Already trading on Nasdaq Stockholm and OTCQX, CoinShares sees the U.S. listing as a gateway to the world's largest asset management market. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti called the US ""the crucible of the digital asset space"" and said the transition accelerates their global leadership ambitions. CoinShares ranks fourth globally for crypto ETPs and leads in EMEA with a 34% share. The firm has more than tripled AUM in two years, driven by new product launches, pricing tailwinds, and strong inflows. With 32 products now spanning ETPs, indices, and digital asset equities, CoinShares is betting on U.S. demand for tokenization and blockchain-based financial tools. In July, CoinShares announced its French subsidiary, CoinShares Asset Management, had received authorisation under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation. With this latest approval, CoinShares became the first regulated asset management firm in continental Europe to be authorised under MiCA. The MiCA authorisation adds to CoinShares' existing regulatory approvals, making it the only asset management firm in continental Europe currently holding all three licences.",CryptoRank,2025-10-01T10:10:14Z,https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/c7a3a-coinshares-to-acquire-fca-regulated-bastion-to-boost-active-crypto-strategies,2025-10-01 18:30:13.635263,0.5137254901960784

"Nigeria Committed To Civic Reorientation For National Development -NOA DG, Issa-Onilu - The News Chronicle","The Director General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, has reiterated Nigeria's commitment to sustained civic reorientation as a key driver of national development. According to him, attitudinal change, value reawakening, and responsible citizenship are central to achieving the country's long-term goals. Issa-Onilu made this known while delivering a keynote address titled 'Africa's New Frontier: Strategic Investment in a Dynamic Landscape' at the 2025 African Investment Showcase held at Bolivar Hall, Venezuela Embassy Cultural Centre in London. He described the moment as a defining one for Africa, urging a strategic repositioning not only in economic terms, but also in ideological outlook. The NOA DG emphasised that Africa's investment landscape should not be viewed solely in terms of infrastructure and capital inflows, but must also be assessed through the strength of its institutions and the level of public trust they command. While highlighting Nigeria's strides in rebuilding its civic framework under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's Renewed Hope Agenda, Onilu underscored the Nigerian Identity Project, a long-term civic reawakening initiative aimed at redefining what it means to be Nigerian in the 21st century.

"This small-cap, agri stock jumps 80% YTD; do you own? | Stock Market News","GRM Overseas has experienced an impressive 80% rise in stock value this year, driven by strategic investments and a booming rice-export market. With major investors increasing their stakes and promising financial results, the company is well-positioned for future growth in the agri sector. Shares of GRM Overseas have been on a roll this year, rising as much as 80 per cent year-to-date (YTD). The stock hit a 52-week high of ₹397.60 on July 16 this year after hitting a 52-week low of ₹175.95 on January 13. On Wednesday, October 1, GRM Overseas' share price rose by over a per cent to an intraday high of ₹363.70. Around 1 pm, the small-cap stock was 1.5 per cent up at ₹363.70. According to Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, the stock is indicating underlying strength. Patel underscored that on the momentum front, the RSI has taken support at its 14-day average, coinciding with the 45-50 zone, which often acts as a base during consolidations. Moreover, the daily MACD has generated a bullish crossover, further reinforcing positive momentum in the short term. ""With these technical signals aligning, the stock looks poised for an upward move. In the immediate horizon, we expect the stock to test the ₹380-385 resistance zone, which has been a crucial supply area. On the downside, ₹353 -- aligned with the trendline support -- remains an important level to watch for risk management,"" said Patel. ""The promoters have divested a total of 2.65 per cent of GRM Overseas for over ₹58 crore in a recent secondary transaction, with stake increased by Nikhil Vora, ace investor Madhusudan Kela's Singularity Ventures, RG Family Trust and Jackson Group,"" said the company. According to the company, Vora's stake rose from 0.33 per cent to 0.85 per cent, Jakson Group's stake expanded from 2.40 per cent to 3.44 per cent, and Singularity Equity Fund's holding grew from 2.20 per cent to 3.35 per cent as they completed a stake purchase from the promoters. GRM Overseas said its consolidated net profit for the June quarter of the current financial year rose nearly 6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹19.09 crore, while the company's revenue for the quarter stood at ₹334.43 crore. GRM Overseas' subsidiary GRM Foodkraft Private Limited reported revenue from operations at ₹539 crore for FY25 compared to ₹257 crore in FY24. This development comes amid a buoyant backdrop for India's rice-export sector. India remains the world's largest rice exporter, with shipments of around 22 million tonnes and a value of $11.4 billion in 2023 (roughly 40 per cent of global trade). According to the company, the 2024-25 period saw a 20 per cent year-on-year rise in rice exports, helping lift overall agricultural and processed-food exports to $25.14 billion, even as overall exports grew modestly.

Supermarket shoppers 'walk away' after seeing Christmas chocolates 'makeover' - The Mirror,"Christmas chocolates always get shoppers excited when they return to stores ahead of December 25. However, this year, instead of spreading festive cheer, the latest Cadbury festive chocolate tubs seem to have divided some shoppers after they were given a makeover and put back on shelves. Supermarket shoppers who plan to spread the cost of the Christmas celebration in December might think that sorting out their chocolate supply months in advance is easy. However, one new offer in the seasonal aisle impressed shoppers at first -- then stunned them once they checked out the price tag. Posting on the Snack Reviews Facebook page about the tins' new makeover, a group member said: ""Square tins of Cadbury chocolates available at Sainsbury's"". Dozens reacted to the different-shaped tubs, which are usually round. One said: ""That packaging is so pretty!"" Another wrote: ""Lovely! Square tins are easier to store too."" A third put: ""What a pretty looking tub, you could refill it for years to come!"" Despite clear excitement among many shoppers, others were quick to point out that the return of ""proper tins"" meant a steeper price tag, which left some divided. The new square tins all contain 700g of chocolate, compared to the usual tubs that range from around 550g. So far, the limited-edition tins are being sold in supermarkets such as Sainsbury's, Waitrose, and Morrisons for £16.50 each. However, at the time of writing, the tins are available directly on the Cadbury website for a slight discount (down from £16.50 to £14). In the comment section, some were unsure about the £16.50 price tag. One person who seemed to admit they'd walk away from the offer wrote: ""At £16.50 they'll be left on shelf"" Another put: ""Not at that price!"" And, a third pointed out: ""I'm sticking with the normal tubs this year, that's not worth £16!"" But not everyone was bothered by the price tag, as many said buying the square tins would be 'better to wrap'. In a separate Facebook post by Money Saver By Dansway, one person commented: ""Easier to wrap for presents"". Someone else put: ""Is it like the old Tins? But square? Roll on Christmas."" A third said: ""Like these much better especially for gifts."" The £16.50 price is mainly because they're limited edition. For those who aren't fussed, stocking up on the original style of chocolate tubs will work out cheaper, as buying tubs of 550g Roses from Sainsbury's, for example, costs £7 each - almost £10 less. Most of the mainstream chocolate tubs, like Heroes and Roses, that are passed around at Christmas used to come in tins. This was until they were switched to plastic tubs or wrapped in paper for sustainability reasons. However, the latest limited edition square tins provide a sense of nostalgia. Elsewhere, Marks and Spencer shoppers can buy a 1.2kg tub of chocolates, which comes in a tin and costs £12. I tried these chocolates myself to see if they could really stand up against the classic treats many of us have enjoyed for generations. When I shared these with visiting family, it didn't seem like a major deal, but almost everyone said that it was nice that they had ""proper"" foil wrappers. One of them said it's ""just like Quality Street used to be,"" and it's clear why lots of other people felt the same way about these treats.",Mirror,2025-10-01T10:08:19Z,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/supermarket-shoppers-walk-away-after-35994563,2025-10-01 18:30:13.636797,0.3019607843137255
Truck driver arrested for cargo theft at IGI Airport; iPhones seized,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (PTI) A 36-year-old truck driver has been arrested for allegedly stealing iPhones from a consignment of the phones going to Dubai from the cargo area at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, police said on Wednesday. Accused Sunil Kumar, a resident of Palam village, allegedly stole three iPhones from a shipment of 148 devices and offered one to a taxi driver after he and his accomplice failed to pay him for a trip, they said. ""Kumar, employed as a truck driver with a transport company operating at the airport, along with his associate Vicky alias Lala, stole a sealed package containing iPhone 15 while transporting cargo. His accomplice is currently absconding,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Vichitra Veer said. The case came to light after a freight-forwarding company reported the theft of three iPhones from a shipment of 148 devices sent to Dubai. The missing units were confirmed by the consignee, prompting a police investigation. The DCP said one stolen iPhone was traced to a taxi driver in Haryana's Sonipat. ""The driver told police that he was offered the device by two heavily-intoxicated passengers who failed to pay him for a trip from Rohtak to Delhi,"" the officer added. He accepted the phone against a fare of Rs 5,000 and paid an additional Rs 15,000. Another device was found from Palam village. Based on descriptions and surveillance, Kumar was identified and arrested on September 26. During interrogation, he confessed to the crime. The third missing iPhone was also found from his hideout in Palam. Police said Kumar was involved in more than 10 cases of snatching and theft in the past.

"Metaplanet's Bitcoin holdings surpass 30,000 BTC, now fourth-largest corporate holder","Metaplanet is cementing its position as one of the most aggressive corporate adopters of Bitcoin, steadily expanding its treasury strategy. Metaplanet's Bitcoin holdings have officially reached the 30,000 BTC milestone. The Tokyo-listed firm confirmed the acquisition of 5,268 BTC on October 1, worth about $615.7 million at an average price of $116,870 per coin. With this purchase, Metaplanet's total holdings now stand at 30,823 BTC (BTC), acquired at a cumulative cost of $3.33 billion, about $107,912 per bitcoin. The company also reported a 497.1% year-to-date yield in 2025, reflecting the strength of its accumulation strategy, particularly after Bitcoin's strong rally a few months ago. According to data compiled by crypto.news, the current holdings place the Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm fourth among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. It also remains the largest holder among listed companies in Asia. Metaplanet's accumulation through the year has been funded mainly via international share offerings and reinvested revenue. The firm also recently secured additional capital through an overseas share offering to channel fresh funds directly into Bitcoin purchases, suggesting that further acquisitions may soon follow. Alongside building one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries, the company has also begun broadening its business structure. In September, Metaplanet announced the establishment of two subsidiaries in the United States and Japan, marking the first major expansion of its business since adopting its BTC-focused treasury strategy in 2024. The company said the U.S. subsidiary will handle income generation through derivatives trading and related services, while the Japan-based unit will focus on media, events, and other Bitcoin-related services. CEO Simon Gerovich has regularly indicated that the company's dual-phase strategy is driven by the belief in Bitcoin as a strategic hedge and growth engine, emphasizing the long-term bet on the asset. With its 30,000 BTC milestone, Metaplanet has now achieved its year-end target set earlier in May. It remains to be seen whether the company can maintain its current pace of accumulation to meet its longer-term goals of 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027.",crypto.news,2025-10-01T10:10:02Z,https://crypto.news/metaplanets-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-30000-btc-now-fourth-largest-corporate-holder/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.637386,0.2549019607843137

East Midlands pubs face mass closures without business rates relief - East Midlands Business Link,"More than 200 pubs in the East Midlands risk closure next year unless the Government intervenes to reduce business rates. Research from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), indicates 226 pubs could shut, threatening 1,486 jobs. The sector is set to face a significant cost increase in 2026 due to the withdrawal of business rates relief and the revaluation of business properties. Without action, pubs' business rates bills could rise by more than 50%, exacerbating existing financial pressures. Pubs currently contribute 2.1% of the UK's Business Rates bill despite generating only 0.4% of total turnover. At the average ratio, their bill would be £130 million rather than £637 million, meaning the sector overpays by £507 million annually. The BBPA projects that, without reform, the UK could lose 2,000 pubs next year, affecting local economies and employment. A proposed 20p reduction in the pound for pubs could prevent almost 40% of closures, safeguarding 5,400 jobs and adding nearly £100 million in Gross Value Added (GVA) to the economy. Alongside business rates reform, the sector highlights the need for reductions in beer duty, employment cost relief, and a review of packaging expenses. The BBPA argues these measures are achievable without direct cost to the Government and are crucial to preserving pubs as economic and social assets.",East Midlands Business Link,2025-10-01T10:08:11Z,https://www.eastmidlandsbusinesslink.co.uk/mag/featured/east-midlands-pubs-face-mass-closures-without-business-rates-relief/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.637977,-0.003921568627450966
CIMB IB expects OPR to remain at 2.75% in November,"KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is expected to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 per cent in November, according to CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. The forecast aligns with the September statement from the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which was not accommodating enough to trigger an immediate change. According to the investment bank's note today, Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy stance will continue to be data-dependent until the end of 2025. ""Fiscal consolidation is set to continue, with Budget 2026 reaffirming this stance. Historically, fiscal easing has only occurred during severe downturns, while monetary policy adjustments typically materialise when growth dips into the low four per cent range,"" it said. CIMB said that policymakers are likely to remain data-dependent through the next MPC meeting in November. ""Recent export strength has been flattered by electrical and electronics (E&E) shipments, which accounted for around 42 per cent of total exports, while non-E&E exports (58 per cent) have shown persistent weakness throughout the year.

"How the government shutdown impacts Pa.'s 100,000 federal workers","In a federal government shutdown, some workers are furloughed and others must work without pay until the shutdown ends. The federal government has shut down as of 12:01 a.m. Wednesday and federal workers are among the first to bear the brunt. The current shutdown could look different from those of the past. President Donald Trump's administration has directed federal agencies to prepare layoff plans separate from the temporary furloughs that typically take place when Congress fails to reach an agreement on how to fund the government. The threat of a government shutdown has become a frequent occurrence in recent years, noted Philip Glover, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 3, which represents federal employees in Philadelphia. Each time, as the funding deadline approaches, it leaves federal workers wondering whether they'll be working and getting paid in the days ahead. ""Our members don't deserve this,"" Glover said. ""And it certainly isn't fair for law enforcement and our TSA folks to have to wonder if they're gonna have to work for a month without paychecks. It's not right."" Pennsylvania had some 101,500 federal employees as of July. Here's a look at what the shutdown means for them. "" : As government shutdown deadline nears, here's what could be impacted and what's different this time Leaders at each federal agency determine who will work and who will be told to stay home during a government shutdown, according to a contingency plan. Most federal employees are typically furloughed and told to stay home, according to guidance from the AFGE union. But some, referred to as ""excepted employees,"" are not furloughed. This includes people doing ""emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,"" according to the government's human resource agency, the Office of Personnel Management. VA medical centers and outpatient clinics will remain open and benefits will be processed. Social Security benefit payments will continue to be issued. Air traffic controllers are expected to work, according to the Department of Transportation. The National Park Service in Philadelphia typically closes completely during a shutdown, said Glover. ""That's usually where we see a lot of the public get upset over a government shutdown,"" Glover said. ""Independence [National Historical Park], obviously, is one of the jewels of the Park Service, and it usually gets a lot of attention when it closes down."" The Environmental Protection Agency has said the majority of employees will not work during the shutdown. Some will stay on for functions such as emergency and disaster assistance. IRS employees will continue to work for five days as normal, using funds from outside the appropriations process. During shutdowns in 2013 and 2018, some 850,000 out of 2.1 million federal employees were furloughed, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan nonprofit. Federal workers who are furloughed are expected to be paid retroactively once a shutdown ends, along with those who continue working. They are not paid during the shutdown. Many federal workers live paycheck to paycheck, said Brad Starnes, president of the union for local EPA employees, and the loss of income is disruptive. ""This is never something that's looked forward to by a federal worker,"" said Starnes. One group of federal workers, deemed ""exempt,"" do work that is not funded by annual appropriations. According to OPM, those workers continue ""to be governed by the normal pay, leave, and other civil service rules."" A law passed in 2019 requires that workers be paid back for unpaid time during a shutdown, including ""excepted"" and furloughed employees. Regarding furloughed workers, Glover said, ""it's not their fault that they're being forced to not work."" ""They want to do the things that they're supposed to do for the government."" he said. ""Congress can't figure out how to do a funding formula in a bill -- that's not these people's fault, and they shouldn't go without pay."" Federal workers keep their health benefits during a government shutdown, according to OPM. During a shutdown, federal employees cannot take paid time off, including pre-planned time off, whether they are furloughed or excepted (required to work). That's a problem for excepted workers who planned to take time off for Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, which begins at sundown Wednesday and ends at sundown Thursday, noted Alex Jay Berman, union leader at the National Treasurer Employees Union Chapter 71, whose members include Philly IRS workers. "" : How Trump's plan to shrink the federal workforce unfolded in Philadelphia Furloughed federal employees may be eligible to apply for unemployment benefits with their state, depending on their state's requirements, according to OPM. In Pennsylvania, workers who are furloughed during a shutdown may be eligible for unemployment benefits, while those who continue to work are not eligible to do so, according to a spokesperson for the state's Department of Labor and Industry. But the shutdown might be over before their claim is processed and paid, said Glover. Still, the union encourages eligible workers to apply. However, once the shutdown ends and they are repaid by the federal government, workers must pay back any unemployment benefits they received. ""They don't get to double dip,"" said Glover. On Sept. 24, President Donald Trump's administration issued a memo directing agencies to make plans for a mass reduction in force if a shutdown came to fruition. This is separate from the typical furloughs that take place during a government shutdown. The memo, from the Office of Management and Budget, said the layoffs should apply to programs that are ""not consistent with the President's priorities,"" and that depend on discretionary funding that lapsed Wednesday. In Philadelphia, union leaders say the threat of more layoffs is just the latest swipe at the federal worker. The federal workforce has gone through a shake-up this year as part of the Trump administration's plan to shrink and reshape it.",The Philadelphia Inquirer,2025-10-01T10:09:40Z,https://www.inquirer.com/business/philadelphia-federal-worker-shutdown-furlough-pay-20251001.html,2025-10-01 18:30:13.638968,-0.01960784313725494
UK manufacturing activity shrinks at fastest pace for five months,"Activity in the UK manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace for five months in September after orders dropped, according to new figures. The downturn came as firms linked to the car industry also warned that their supply chains were affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 46.2 for the month, decreasing from 47.0 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting. The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. It was in line with economist expectations for the month. The survey showed a reduction in both domestic demand and export orders for the month as companies highlighted ""challenging"" market sentiment. Manufacturers said they scaled back production as a result, marking the 11th consecutive month of declining production. Worsening market conditions were also linked to weaker client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and higher costs. Employment in the sector also slumped again, with companies reporting that they reduced headcount to offset higher costs following increases to the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions. Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The final Manufacturing PMI results provide further worrying news for the health of UK industry. ""Manufacturers are facing an increasingly challenging environment, with intakes of new business and levels of production hit by weak market sentiment, a dearth of new export work and a high-cost environment exacerbated by tax and labour cost rises. ""Companies entwined into the autos supply chain are also facing a temporary hit to activity following the cyber-attack on JLR."" Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The weakness in September's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) may be exaggerated by businesses' concerns over tax rises at the upcoming Autumn Budget and temporary factory closures in the automotive sector. ""However, the sector certainly faces weak domestic and external demand as it navigates slowing real income growth, tightening fiscal policy, and a global economy that is still getting to grips with higher US tariffs.""",Kent Online,2025-10-01T10:09:26Z,https://www.kentonline.co.uk/news/national/uk-manufacturing-activity-shrinks-at-fastest-pace-for-five-months-155849/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.639286,-0.1294117647058823
2 admitted to hospital after county bus rollover | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"""A lot of passengers rely on our bus service -- to go to work, to go to the doctor, post office, bank, you know, to see family, friends. So, you know, this is a major issue for us."" The driver of a Hawaii County Hele-On bus that rolled down an embankment and overturned early Tuesday morning in Laupahoehoe has been relieved of his duties pending further investigation. According to Tom Callis, spokesman for Mayor Kimo Alameda, the driver, a 66-year-old Hilo man, was treated for minor injuries. Callis said the driver was contracted through the private transportation company Roberts Hawaii. ""At this point, no charges have been filed, but the investigation is ongoing,"" added Hawaii Police Department Sgt. Branden Watanabe of Hamakua Patrol Division. Asked about the nature of the investigation or any potential charges, Watanabe replied, ""At this point, it's considered a regular traffic collision with injuries involved."" According to police, Hawaii Fire Department personnel examined the driver and 22 passengers at the scene. All 22 passengers were transported by multiple ambulances to Hilo Benioff Medical Center for further evaluation. ""After some precautionary evaluation, two of them were admitted, but everyone else was treated and released at the hospital,"" Watanabe said. The bus, which was traveling toward Honokaa on the Hawaii Belt Road, had stopped at the Laupahoehoe Scenic Lookout to pick up passengers, police said. The driver told officers that he had placed the bus in park and walked toward the rear of the vehicle to check for available seating, when the bus began rolling backward onto the highway, went through a guardrail and down an embankment, coming to rest on its passenger side. That's the side of the bus where the entrance and exit doors are. ""Some of the people who were calling in were saying that people were coming out of the emergency exit, so it sounds like at least a good portion of them self-extricated,"" Watanabe said. ""I think some of them who were a little more seriously injured were helped out by (the Hawaii Fire Department) or bystanders."" The call for assistance came at 4:56 a.m. with responders directed to the 25.5-mile marker of Mamalahoa Highway (Route 19). They found the bus down the embankment on the makai side of the highway. Alameda appeared Tuesday on Hawaii News Now's ""Spotlight Hawaii"" early morning program and shared some preliminary information about the crash.

"College financial aid: What students, families need to know about 2026 FAFSA changes","The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is open and marks the beginning of college application season. The process should be streamlined after a couple of years of errors and delays, according to the Department of Education. Chandra Scott, executive director of Alabama Possible, said the online application should be faster this year, a ""game-changer"" for busy families. Starting July 1, 2026, there will be major new borrower limitations for some families and students due to President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" The FAFSA is used to determine how much financial aid a college student can receive from the federal government. The application looks at several factors, including parents' income, to determine eligibility. Colleges and universities use the FAFSA to guide their students' financial aid process for scholarships and grants. As for the form itself, there are a couple of adjustments that should make the application process easier. Students and parents with a social security number who are creating a StudentAid.gov account for the first time should be instantly verified. The verification process previously lasted one to three days. Chandra Scott, executive director of Alabama Possible, said this feature is a ""game-changer"" and the ""biggest win"" for the 2026 FAFSA. She recounted events where families would gather to start the application process not knowing they needed to have a StudentAid.gov ID. ""That was a huge barrier that we heard counselors and financial aid advisors complain about all the time,"" Scott said. Student Aid promises faster verification and more accurate and secure data. Students can share an invite code so a parent or financial contributor can complete their portion of the FAFSA. Scott said this makes the process easier and faster, ""because families have to make decisions on what they can and can't afford. And when that process is delayed, you quickly see students just opt out of the process."" The FAFSA application deadline is June 30, 2027. Scott wants to see students get the ball rolling now so they can begin applying for college in time to start in the fall of 2026. The amount and type of loans available will change for many graduate students now that Trump's budget bill is enacted. These changes could limit which colleges students can afford to attend. The Graduate PLUS Loan program is eliminated, and graduate students will have tighter restrictions on how much they can borrow: An unsubsidized loan means the federal government will not pay interest while the student is in school. The total amount students can borrow is $138,500. The Parent PLUS loan program now has borrowing limits of up to $20,000 per year for each student with a total limit of $65,000 per student. Scott said she hasn't heard from any student or parent borrowers about these changes, but expects to learn more about how Alabama students are affected. Since most of the process is automated, there should be no interruption in the application process if the federal government shuts down on Sept. 30. However, students and families getting errors on the application or having other major issues may experience delays due to the Department of Education staff furloughs. Last year, the state's FAFSA completion rate was lower than expected, 55%, according to Gov. Kay Ivey. Ivey declared October is FAFSA Completion Month to try to boost the number of students who apply. Alabama Possible offers assistance for applying for financial aid, including one-on-one FAFSA walkthroughs via Zoom.

Survey Uncovers Surprising Number of Americans Ready to Swap Remote Work for More Money,"A number of the biggest companies in the U.S. have tightened or abandoned their hybrid work policies in the last year, with some CEOs saying less work is done working remotely. Would you swap your pajama pants and couch for a suit and a cubicle if it meant more money? Remote work has been on the decline in the last year since booming during the pandemic, with some companies mandating a return to office. And now a new survey shows that most workers would give up working from home in exchange for a raise. Human resources and consulting firm Robert Half this week put out its annual Salary Guide for 2026 with typical salary ranges for dozens of jobs, along with a survey of about 4,200 total workers and hiring managers. About 66% of workers surveyed said they would return to office five days a week in exchange for making more money. However, 60% that group said they would need a raise of at least 10% before stepping back in the office. And while nearly 90% of workers surveyed said they feel confident in negotiating their salary when they have a job offer, some said they remain uncertain of how to determine their value or back up the amount they are requesting. Half of the hiring managers surveyed said they expect to add new perks this year to entice new hires, a much-needed step as 74% said they are worried that meeting an applicant's expectations on things like salary and work-life balance are increasingly important. The most common perks workers want when changing jobs? Non-base pay financial incentives (53%), other work-life balance perks (51%), and retirement planning (42%). The news that many Americans would give up remote working for more money is likely welcome news to many CEOs, who have been looking for ways to lure workers back to the office without implementing the return to office (RTO) mandates that many of America's biggest companies have rolled out in the last year. Since last September, companies that have tightened their return to office policies include Amazon (AMZN), Uber Technologies (UBER), and Intel (INTC), along with others like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Ford (F). Others, straying from issuing a strict RTO policy, have tried to entice workers back with other perks, to the extent that some analysts are growing more bullish on denim apparel makers who could benefit from a more casual office wardrobe. Two-thirds of American workers say they could be convinced to return to an office full-time if it came with a raise, per a new survey from Robert Half. The rate of Americans working from home has been around a third of the country for three straight years after surging during the pandemic. Many CEOs say they struggle to believe all of an employee's work gets done when they are working remotely, part of what is leading a surge of companies to order employees back to the office. If you're willing to work from a cubicle again, it could mean more money in your pocket for your financial goals.",Investopedia,2025-10-01T10:01:00Z,https://www.investopedia.com/survey-uncovers-surprising-number-of-americans-ready-to-swap-remote-work-for-more-money-11820295,2025-10-01 18:30:13.640780,0.05098039215686279

World shares are mixed as a US government shutdown adds to uncertainty,"U.S. futures sank and world shares were mixed after a U.S. government shutdown began on Wednesday. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.6%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Dow gained 0.2%, to set an all-time high. The Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher to 22,660.01. In early European trading, Germany's DAX lost 0.2% to 23,916.90 and the CAC 40 in Paris gave up 0.2% to 7,907.99. Britain's FTSE rose 0.7% to 9,416.30. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed 0.9% to 44,550.85 after the Bank of Japan reported a slight improvement in business sentiment among major manufacturers. The indications from the BOJ's quarterly tankan survey raise the odds that the central bank will increase its key interest rate to counter inflation that has topped its target range of about 2% for some time. Political uncertainty is also looming over Japan's markets, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party due to chose a new leader and prime minister later this week to replace embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Markets and offices in mainland China are closed until Oct. 8 for the National Day holiday, China's central bank said it plans a 1.1 trillion yuan ($160 billion) reverse repo operation on Oct. 9, to increase the amount of cash in circulation and stimulate consumer spending and business investment. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,455.83, while Taiwan's Taiex added 0.6% on heavy buying of semiconductor-related shares. Markets appeared to be taking the U.S. shutdown, which took effect at midnight U.S. Eastern time, in stride. Past U.S. government shutdowns have had a limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. This shutdown could be different, with the White House prone to push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs won't derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Tuesday brought mixed reports on the U.S. economy. A Conference Board survey showed consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ""low-hire, low-fire"" state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that's neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, since a government shutdown would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday's on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. The Department of Labor has said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there's a lapse. The agency already was strained by Trump's firing of Erika McEntarfer as BLS commissioner on Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed a rapid slowdown in hiring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Late Tuesday, the White House said Trump was withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the bureau, according to an AP source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a White House action that hadn't been publicly announced. Oil prices fell back early Wednesday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil shedding 21 cents to $62.16 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 22 cents to $65.80 per barrel.

"No IIT, NIT: Techie from tier 3 college lands dream job, goes from Rs 16 lakh to Rs 1.6 crore in less than 4 years","A young engineer with three years of experience secured a staggering ₹1.6 crore package, a tenfold increase, at a global networking company. This remarkable achievement, shared by a former colleague, highlights how deep C++ specialization enabled a tier-3 college graduate to land a top role. In the fast-paced world of technology careers, salary jumps are common, but few have captured public attention the way one young engineer's story has. A professional with just three years of industry experience has transitioned from earning ₹16 lakh annually to securing a staggering package of ₹1.6 crore at a leading global professional networking company. The tenfold rise has left online communities both astonished and deeply curious about how such a transformation was possible. The remarkable journey came to light when Vaibhav Agarwal, a friend and former colleague, shared the update on X. Agarwal revealed that the two had once worked together at Samsung before charting their own professional paths. While Agarwal himself is now employed at a large IT services company, his friend went on to achieve this extraordinary milestone. Adding to the intrigue, Agarwal mentioned that his friend graduated in 2022 from a tier-3 college -- institutions not typically associated with such elite placements. Starting his career at a multinational manufacturing conglomerate with a salary package of ₹16 lakh per year, he has now secured a senior software engineering position at a well-known networking platform. The contrast in numbers, Agarwal emphasized, is the most dramatic salary leap he has ever witnessed. The post documenting this achievement quickly gained traction, crossing 25,000 views. Social media users flooded the comments section, eager to understand the methods behind the success. Many asked about the technologies he specialized in, while others sought guidance on interview strategies and long-term career planning. In response to the queries, Agarwal revealed that his friend's core expertise lies in C++, honed over three years of consistent practice and application in real-world projects. This detail further fueled discussions on how deep specialization in one technical domain can sometimes outweigh pedigree or educational background when it comes to landing high-paying roles at global firms.",Economic Times,2025-10-01T10:09:21Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/no-iit-nit-techie-from-tier-3-college-lands-dream-job-goes-from-rs-16-lakh-to-rs-1-6-crore-in-less-than-4-years/articleshow/124255390.cms,2025-10-01 18:30:13.643327,0.5058823529411764

"Charlie Javice, Convicted of Defrauding JPMorgan Chase, Sentenced to Over 7 Years in Prison","Prior to her sentencing, Javice, 31, told the court she was ""haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous"" A start-up founder convicted of defrauding banking giant JPMorgan Chase was sentenced to 85 months in federal prison on Monday, Sept. 29. Charlie Javice, who was named on the Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list, was found guilty in March of conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud for inflating the number of customers of her company Frank in order to ""fraudulently induce"" JPMorgan to purchase it for $175 million, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. ""Javice perpetrated a $175 million fraud -- repeatedly lying about the success of her startup company and even hiring a data scientist to create fake data to back up her lies,"" said prosecutor Amanda Houle. Prior to her sentencing, Javice, 31, told the court she was ""haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous,"" Associated Press reported. ""Not a day goes by that I do not replay my mistakes, searching for meaning,"" Javice said, per Business Insider. ""Not a day passes that I do not feel profound remorse."" ""I don't think you will be committing any crimes, and I think you will be devoting your life to service,"" US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein told Javice during Monday's sentencing, per Business Insider. ""But others need to be deterred."" According to prosecutors, Javice founded Frank in 2017 to help students simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a government form for students seeking financial aid for college or graduate school. Federal prosecutors said in 2021 Javice began to pursue buyers for Frank, one of which was JPMorgan. ""Javice represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or 'users,'"" according to a press release. ""In fact, Frank had approximately 300,000 users."" According to prosecutors, when the banking giant wanted to verify the number of Frank's users and the amount of data collected about them, Javice allegedly created a ""synthetic data set"" to add more customers -- and even ""caused"" a third-party vendor to ""convey"" the phony spreadsheet to JPMorgan.

Zimbabwe posts US$7.2m trade surplus,"Zimbabwe has registered a major economic milestone, recording a US$7,2 million trade surplus in August 2025 -- the first in nearly two years -- as exports outpaced imports. During the period under review exports rose to US$878 million driven mainly by gold (52,7%), nickel, and tobacco. Imports eased to US$871 million, with fuel imports went down 4,5 percent. Gold prices soared globally to US$3 600/oz, boosting Zimbabwe's foreign currency earnings. Following a US$10,4 million deficit in July 2025, the August surplus demonstrates a commendable and welcome improvement in the country's once negatively skewed trade balance. The primary driver of the surplus was a strong surge in export earnings. In August, Zimbabwe's exports climbed to US$878,16 million, a 30,3 percent expansion compared to the same month last year, when exports valued at US$674,05 million were shipped. Compared to July this year, the outturn similarly represents a solid uptick of 0,2 percent. Zimbabwe's total Imports in 2024 were valued at US$9.53 Billion, according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade. Zimbabwe's main import partners were: South Africa, China and Bahamas. The top three import commodities were: Mineral fuels, oils, distillation products; Machinery, nuclear reactors, boilers and Cereals. Total Exports were valued at US$7.43 Billion.

We're not in an 'AI winter' -- but here's how to survive a cold snap todayheadline | Today Headline,"Over the nearly three years since ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, generative AI has created a frenzy that has radiated like the midday summer sun -- hot and unrelenting. And for the AI companies rocketing forth like heat-seeking missiles, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and xAI, the sun is still shining: The research firm Gartner forecasts worldwide AI spending will reach nearly $1.5 trillion in 2025 and surpass $2 trillion in 2026, fueled by integration into smartphones, PCs, and enterprise infrastructure. Elon Musk and other AI leaders continue to insist that artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- an AI that can think and learn like a human, across many tasks -- is on the horizon. But on the ground, the temperature is dropping, and it's starting to feel like sweater weather. Among customers and in financial markets, skepticism is rising as some question whether the massive investment in AI will ever be justified by revenues. Startup funding is under sharper scrutiny for small and midsize firms; enterprise projects are stuck in ""pilot purgatory""; corporate buyers are questioning return on investment for AI expenditures; and the rising cost of computing power has become a wall many would-be competitors can't climb. We don't yet know whether this chill will eventually turn into an ""AI winter,"" the industry term for the stage in past AI hype cycles when enthusiasm waned and investment dried up. As my colleague Jeremy Kahn has noted, AI winters have often followed a familiar arc: promising advances that failed to deliver, leaving those footing the bill disillusioned. Sometimes the trigger was academic research exposing the limits of certain techniques. Sometimes it was the failure of real-world adoption. Most often, it was both. ""There are certainly a few autumnal signs, a falling leaf carried on the breeze here and there, if past AI winters are any guide,"" Kahn recently wrote. Only time will tell whether this is ""the prelude to another arctic bomb that will freeze AI investment for a generation, or merely a momentary cold snap before the sun appears again."" The latter scenario may not be such a bad thing. Rowan Curran, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, told Fortune he sees a necessary reset underway. ""Our thermometer was broken before,"" he said. ""Now we're finally getting the correct temperature."" Curran emphasized that enterprise clients are not pulling back from AI. Instead, they are recalibrating in the face of overhyped promises. Agentic AI, for example, has been marketed as if all organizations need to roll out universal AI agents to every employee overnight. ""Now companies are saying, 'We don't necessarily need a generalized agent for everyone tomorrow,'"" he explained. ""'We need to think more carefully about our data structures and the quality of our content, so we can take a more deliberate approach.'"" The high-flying dreams of fully realized AGI by 2027 are clearly being tamped down. But that doesn't mean the commitment to AI is fading. What Curran sees instead is a gap between leadership expectations and practical outcomes. Too often, he said, executives set mandates disconnected from specific business goals, like, ""Every employee must use generative AI twice a day. ""That's when disappointment creeps in,"" he said -- not because AI is failing outright, but because the expectations were never tied to realistic applications in the first place. Bill Briggs, chief technology officer of Deloitte, also acknowledges a vibe shift around AI, but he says we're not facing a dire moment like the late 1990s in tech. ""It's certainly at an inflection point, but I don't see this being a repeat of the dotcom bust,"" he said. AI is still driving transformation, he explained, and new business models are just getting started. Overall, he said, AI is becoming less of a rising star and more of an ambient operator that will quietly influence how organizations think about every process, product, and decision. ""AI is poised to evolve much like electricity -- invisible in our daily lives but powering everything,"" he said. Not everyone agrees that the temperature is falling. Steve Hall, partner and president of ISG EMEA and chief AI officer at the global technology research and advisory firm, insisted that an AI winter is a remote possibility. ""This is early spring,"" he said. ""Gen AI is less than three years old, and agentic AI is only 15 months old. The hype cycle is through the roof, but in many cases the bulbs and flowers are just beginning to appear."" Hall argued that much of the investment so far has been concentrated in chips and at hyperscalers, the massive tech and cloud-computing companies that have spent the past three years building the infrastructure to support their AI projects. Software-as-a-service providers, meanwhile, used 2024 to ""agentify"" their applications and add intelligence to business processes. What skeptics call evidence of stalled adoption, Hall frames as the natural experimentation phase. ""We see these pilots not as failures to scale, but as the necessary testing and validation that happens before committing valuable resources. It's exactly how companies should respond to such an exciting technology,"" he said. Overall, this AI chill may pass, or it may deepen. Either way, history shows that hype alone never keeps the heat on. For executives trying to cut through the noise, the question isn't what season we're in -- it's how to steer AI investments wisely. Experts point to four strategies to weather the chill: Rowan Curran of Forrester Research cautions that chasing quick wins -- like shaving a few seconds off call-center times or blasting out more sales emails -- rarely delivers lasting value. ""If those efforts aren't connected to real efficiency, effectiveness, or transformation goals, they're likely to end in failure,"" he said. The companies seeing success are the ones connecting AI pilots directly to measurable outcomes. Bill Briggs of Deloitte said the leaders who secure funding for new AI capabilities aren't just talking tech -- they're framing AI as a driver of growth. ""Your CEO needs to see you as a business partner who happens to know technology, rather than a tech expert who occasionally talks business,"" he told Fortune. That means connecting AI initiatives to outcomes that make executives lean forward in their chairs: new markets, happier customers, streamlined operations, and durable competitive advantage. With hyperscalers, chipmakers, and software-as-a-service providers laying the foundation, Steve Hall of ISG EMEA argued that enterprises should plug into the broader AI ecosystem instead of trying to build everything in-house. ""This is not something you want to go at alone,"" he said. ""My advice to tech leaders is to lead with curiosity and optimism but keep one hand on the wheel of pragmatism,"" said Briggs. ""The landscape is shifting fast. The goal isn't simply AI adoption but building AI into the very architecture of your operations.""",Inside The Star-Studded World,2025-10-01T10:06:49Z,https://todayheadline.co/were-not-in-an-ai-winter-but-heres-how-to-survive-a-cold-snap-todayheadline/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.646241,0.2470588235294118
"Deglobalization, Towards the Right or Left?","On Sept 23, 2025, the Foreign Policy Association and the Committee of 100 hosted a debate on the topic ""Is Deglobalization Inevitable?,"" with Walden Bello, co-chair of the Board of Focus on the Global South, and Edward Ashbee of the Copenhagen Business School, with Bello defending the affirmative side, after a fireside chat with Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz. The audience judged Bello's position the more persuasive of the two sides. In the 1990s, we were told that we were entering an era, known as globalization, that, owing to free trade and unobstructed capital flows in a borderless global economy, would lead to the best of all possible worlds. Most of the West's economic, political, and intellectual elites bought into this vision. I still remember how the venerable Thomas Friedman of The New York Times lampooned those of us who resisted this vision as ""flat-earthers,"" or believers in a flat earth. I still recall the equally venerable Economist magazine singling me out as coining the word ""deglobalization,"" not with the aim of hailing me as a prophet but as a fool preaching a return to a Jurassic past. Thirty years on, this flat-earther takes no pride in having forecast the mess we are in, to which unfettered globalization has been a central contributor: the highest rates of inequality in decades, growing poverty in both the Global North and the Global South, deindustrialization in the United States and many other countries, massive indebtedness of consumers in the Global North and whole countries in the Global South, financial crisis after financial crisis, the rise of the far right, uncontrolled climate change, and intensifying geopolitical conflict. Globalization did not lead to a new world order but to the Brave New World. Let me present three snapshots of that era of globalization that we are now leaving: Snapshot No 1: Apple was one of the main beneficiaries of globalization. Apple led the escape away from the confines of the national economy to create global supply chains propped up by cheap labor. Let me just quote The New York Times in this regard: Apple employs 43,000 people in the United States and 20,000 overseas, a small fraction of the over 400,000 American workers at General Motors in the 1950s, or the hundreds of thousands at General Electric in the 1980s. Many more people work for Apple's contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble iPads, iPhones and Apple's other products. But almost none of them work in the United States. Instead, they work for foreign companies in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere, at factories that almost all electronics designers rely upon to build their wares. Apple, of course, was not alone in the drive to deindustrialize America. It was accompanied by fellow IT corporations Microsoft, Intel, and Invidia; automakers GM, Ford, and Tesla; pharmaceutical giants Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer; and other leaders in other industries and services, such as Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, Walmart, and Amazon, to name just a few. The favorite destination was China, where wages were 3-5 percent of wages of workers in the United States. The ""China Shock"" is estimated, conservatively, to have led to the loss of 2.4 million U.S. jobs. Employment in manufacturing dropped to 11.7 million in October 2009, a loss of 5.5 million or 32 percent of all manufacturing jobs since October 2000. The last time fewer than 12 million people worked in the manufacturing sector was before World War II, in 1941. Snapshot 2: The removal of the barriers to the free flow of capital globally led to the Third World Debt Crisis in the early 1980s, which almost brought down the Citibank and other U.S. financial institutions, and the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, which brought down the so-called Asian miracle economies. Removing global capital controls was accompanied by the deregulation of the U.S. financial system, which led to the creation of massive profit-making scams through the so-called magic of financial engineering like the frenzied trading in sub-prime mortgages. Not only were millions bankrupted and lost their homes when the subprime securities were exposed as rotten, but the whole global system stood on the brink of collapse in 2008, and it was saved only by the bailout of U.S. banks, with U.S. taxpayers money, to the tune of over $1 trillion. Snapshot 3 is the famous French economist Thomas Piketty's summing up of the U.S. economic tragedy of the first quarter of the twenty-first century. [I] want to stress that the word ""collapse"" [in the case of the United States] is no exaggeration. The bottom 50 percent of the income distribution claimed around 20 percent of national income from 1950 to 1980; but that share has been divided almost in half, falling to just 12 per cent in 2010-2015. The top centile's share has moved in the opposite direction, from barely 11 per cent to more than 20 percent. Accompanying this massive increase in inequality in the United States has been an increase in poverty. Globally, according to available data, since the financial crises of 2007-08, wealth inequality has risen, and now the top one percent owns half the world's total household wealth. Let me turn from this nostalgic recounting of the past, and once more, let me focus on our good friend Apple. It is now leading the so-called reshoring process. It has read the handwriting on the wall and, though this will negatively affect its bottom line and scramble its operations, to protect the remainder of its super profits, it is leading the reshoring of its supply chains, with a planned $600 billion investment in the manufacture within the United States of its iPhone, iPad, MacBook, as well as in the fabrication of semi-conductor chips. Boasting that Apple manufacturing plans will create 450,000 jobs in the United States, CEO Tim Cook admitted to being a hostage to Trump's push to deglobalize the operations of American firms, saying, ""The president has said he wants more in the United States...so we want more in the United States."" Where Apple goes, others follow, among them U.S. chipmakers Intel and Nvidia, automotive leader Tesla, and pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson. But American firms are not the only hostages to politics. Among the foreign firms that have bowed to Trump's ultra-protectionist push via unilateral tariff increases by regionalizing or nationalizing their supply lines are Hyundai Motors, Honda Motors, Samsung electronics, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, and pharmaceutical firm Sanofi. Although reshoring or relocation has proceeded by fits and starts over the last decade, under the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, it is likely to accelerate over the next few years, despite constraints and inefficiencies, as economic nationalism rises in the United States and the West. In 2023, an exhaustive study of North American firms showed that that more than 90 percent of manufacturing companies in the region had moved at least some of their production or supply chain in the past five years. Another study conducted at the same time showed that by 2026, 65 percent of surveyed companies would be buying most key items from regional suppliers, compared to just 38 percent in 2023. With Trump imposing unilateral tariffs on Mexico and Canada, companies are realizing that relocating to the NAFTA partners may not appease Trump; they will have to relocate to the United States itself, despite the disruption and chaos that might accompany that process, such as that which saw 300 workers vital to the Hyundai facility in Georgia arrested by ICE and deported to Korea. The tremendous global anger and resentment at the dystopia to which corporate-driven globalization has led us is perhaps the biggest reason why deglobalization will be the trend for a long, long while. That rage first came from the left, which inflicted a reversal from which corporate-driven globalization never recovered during the historic Battle of Seattle in December 1999. But it was Donald Trump and other forces of the far right that successfully rode that anger to political triumph in the United States and Europe in the coming decades. In other words, the politics of rage, not the economics of narrow efficiency in the service of corporate profitability is now in command. In the United States, globalization created two antagonistic communities, one that benefited from it due to their superior education and incomes, the other that suffered from it owing to their lack of both economic and educational advantages. The latter is the vast sector of the population that Hillary Clinton called the ""deplorables,"" but is better known as the ""Make America Great Again"" folks or MAGA base. That community will not easily forget either the sufferings brought about by the deindustrialization spearheaded by Apple and other well-known TNCs or the slights they endured from Hillary, whom they regard as being in the pocket of Wall Street. A second reason for the strength of the deglobalization wave is that the multilateral order that served as the political canopy or system of governance for free trade and unobstructed capital flows is on the brink of collapse. The World Trade Organization, which was once described as the jewel in the crown of multilateralism, no longer functions as a system for governing world trade, partly owing to sabotage by the United States, when under Obama and later Trump and Biden, Washington could no longer rely on favorable rulings in trade disputes. The International Monetary Fund has not recovered from its reputation of promoting austerity in developing countries and its push for unfettered capital flows that brought down the Asian tiger economies. The World Bank also is discredited for its complicity in imposing austerity measures as well as for the wrong-headed policy of export-oriented industrialization for Global North markets that the Bank prescribed as the route to prosperity for developing countries -- one that is now especially fatal for those who followed it given the ultra-protectionism sweeping the United States. Third, national security, both economic security and military security, has displaced prosperity through trade and investment as the principal consideration in relations among countries. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have banned the transfer of advanced computer chips to China, and more such measures will follow. Reorganizing and regionalizing, if not nationalizing, access to and supply lines for key resources for advanced technologies like lithium, rare earth, copper, cobalt, and nickel is now an overriding concern, the aim being not only to monopolize these sensitive commodities but to prevent competitors from getting hold of them. The issue is not the inevitability of deglobalization but what form deglobalization will take. Deglobalization marked by ultra-protectionism in trade relations, unilateralism and isolationism in economic and military relations, and the creation of a domestic market geared principally towards the interests of the racial and ethnic majority is one way to deglobalize. That is indeed where Trump is leading the United States. But there is another way to deglobalize, the key elements of which I laid out in my book Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy 25 years ago. One, we do not demand a withdrawal into autarky but continued participation in the international economy, but in a way that ensures that instead of swamping it, international market forces are harnessed to assist in building the capacity to sustain a vibrant domestic economy. Two, we propose that via a judicious combination of equality-enhancing redistributive measures and reasonable tariffs and quotas, the internal market will again become the engine of a healthy economy instead of being an appendage of an export-oriented economy. Third, we promote participation in a plurality of economic groupings-those that allow countries to maintain policy space for development, instead of imprisoning them in a single global body, the World Trade Organization, with a uniform set of rules, one that favors the interests of transnational corporations instead of the interests of their citizens. Fourth, inspired by the work of Karl Polanyi, we advocate the re-embedding of the market in the community, so that instead of driving the latter, as in global capitalism, the market is subject to the values and rhythms of the community. And finally, in contrast to the far right, we uphold the notion of community as one where membership is not determined by blood or ethnicity but by a shared belief in democratic values. That is the alternative we offered a quarter of a century ago. This fluid system of international trade that allows especially the economies of the Global South the space to pursue sustainable development is not far from the flexible global trading system before the takeoff of globalization in the late eighties, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Twenty five years ago, we were promoting and we continue to promote a route of progressive deglobalization, one that avoids the extreme of the doctrinaire dystopia of corporate-driven globalization, on the one hand, and, on the other, savage unilateralism and protectionism. This route to deglobalization is not new, nor, some would claim, particularly radical. Keynes' common sense advice, addressing the global situation in the 1930s, is very relevant to our times, ""Let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national."" Had we taken this route, I dare say, the chances are great that we would not be in the terrible mess the world is in today, with the threat not only of trade war but of real war at its doorsteps. There is still time to take this route, but the window of opportunity is closing fast.",The Smirking Chimp,2025-10-01T09:56:02Z,http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/walden-bello/115031/deglobalization-towards-the-right-or-left,2025-10-01 18:30:13.647692,0.1372549019607843
Foundation taps pandemic-era 'resilience fund' as nonprofits brace for funding cuts | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . The Hawaii Community Foundation has reactivated its Hawaii Resilience Fund to confront what leaders say is one of the most severe threats to the state's nonprofit sector in decades: the loss of federal funding that sustains food programs, housing assistance, child welfare and other essential services for hundreds of thousands of residents. According to HCF, more than $97 million in federal grants to Hawaii nonprofits has already been cut, frozen or delayed, with as much as $300 million more at risk. The fallout could affect more than 500,000 residents who rely on nonprofits for daily support -- from children to elders -- and trigger layoffs across a sector that employs 80,000 people, or roughly one in eight workers in the state. ""The Hawai'i Resilience Fund is designed to complement -- not duplicate -- state resources by offering more nimble, transparent, and transformative support,"" Terry George, HCF president and CEO, said in a statement. ""Our goal is to collectively build a nonprofit sector that is prepared, not just reactive; collaborative, not siloed; sustainable, not fragile."" George then told the Hono­lulu Star-Advertiser that being ""prepared, not just reactive"" requires nonprofits to strengthen their capacity before a crisis hits -- diversifying revenue streams beyond federal dollars, setting aside operational reserves and investing in fundraising to build stronger local donor bases; involves candid discussions among boards and leadership about long-term sustainability -- including exploring alternative strategies when necessary. He added that many nonprofit leaders are already confronting the challenge directly by grounding their decisions in their core mission and values. George also said the decision to relaunch the fund came after months of warning signs. As early as spring, nonprofits began reporting cancellations of existing federal contracts or threats that such contracts could be pulled. The situation worsened after Congress passed a reconciliation bill, clarifying the scale of reductions ahead. ""The tipping point was that we began hearing early this spring about cancellations of existing federal contracts for nonprofits,"" George said. ""Once the reconciliation bill was passed by Congress and signed into law, many of our nonprofit partners were now much clearer that they were facing dramatic funding shortfalls for the coming years."" The concern was that these cuts would erode nonprofits' ability to sustain basic operations, threatening the safety net for vulnerable residents. That sense of urgency, George said, mirrored the climate in 2020, when HCF first created the Resilience Fund at the height of the pandemic. After realizing the scope of the challenge, HCF sought input from its nonprofit partners, surveyed 22 peer foundations, and commissioned the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization to produce an analysis of financial risks to the sector. That report is scheduled for release on Thursday. At the same time, HCF and the Harold K.L. Castle Foundation seeded the fund to enable a rapid response. Nearly $300,000 in initial grants are already in motion, Hee said, to help measure the impact and provide immediate assistance. HCF also committed $500,000 of its own reserves and is aiming to raise at least $1.8 million by the end of October from philanthropic, corporate and individual partners. ""This is about collective community response, not any single funder solving the problem alone,"" George said. ""Every contribution matters."" Two initial grants totaling $146,000 have already been distributed: >> $46,747 to UHERO: The research group is mapping Hawaii's dependence on federal funding, identifying canceled and frozen grants and projecting risks to both organizations and the services they provide. >> $100,000 to the Hawaii Alliance of Nonprofit Organizations, or HANO: The statewide network will expand staffing and technology systems to provide technical assistance and policy advocacy for nonprofits navigating the crisis. George explained the strategy: ""When fashioning a grantmaking strategy, it helps by starting with clear data on the nature of the problem. That's why we commissioned research from UHERO. It also helps by building the capacity of anchor organizations such as HANO. ... Together, these grants provide intelligence, UHERO, and infrastructure, HANO, for effective response."" Early indications suggest health and education organizations are being hit hardest, including some Native Hawaiian-serving programs affected by the elimination of the federal Native Hawaiian Education Program. UHERO's forthcoming report is expected to provide deeper analysis. Meanwhile, the potential impact on services is already coming into focus. George pointed to one nonprofit that operates multiple domestic violence shelters where more than 90% of the operating budget comes from federal sources. He also cited estimates from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: roughly 22,000 Hawaii residents could lose SNAP benefits and another 49,000 may lose Medicaid coverage in the coming years due to new work requirements. ""That will put pressure on local food banks and health-related nonprofits by significantly raising demand for their services,"" he said. While the Resilience Fund will provide short-term assistance, HCF leaders emphasized that its broader mission is to help nonprofits adapt to a new funding reality. Beginning in September, an open call will invite organizations to apply for grants designed to support operational transformations, restructuring or the development of new funding models. Alongside direct grantmaking, HCF plans to strengthen nonprofit capacity through technical assistance. In partnership with HANO, it will launch a resource hub offering coaching, legal guidance, financial planning and wellness support for nonprofit leaders. The fund will also invest in collective advocacy, backing sector-wide communications and policy engagement to ensure nonprofits have a strong voice in decision­-making. At the same time, HCF intends to keep its approach flexible, allowing grants to evolve in response to shifting community needs as the funding crisis unfolds. George said the foundation will prioritize organizations with the greatest need, community importance and capacity to maximize resources. Smaller, community­-based groups may also benefit, though HCF's reach will depend on how much is ultimately raised for the fund. The COVID-19 pandemic offered lessons that now guide HCF's approach. During that time, the foundation learned to trust nonprofits to identify their communities' needs, rely on data to drive decision-making, work closely with other funders and government and remain flexible enough to adjust as circumstances change. That model of pooled funding and rapid response, she noted, allowed HCF to move $12.2 million into the community during the pandemic. Today, the foundation hopes to replicate that impact -- only this time to counteract federal disinvestment. HCF acknowledges that philanthropy cannot replace federal dollars entirely. ""There's no way that we can fully replace federal dollars with philanthropic grants, so we'll have to focus on catalytic opportunities to build capacity to get through this period of stress,"" George said.

Yemen's Houthi rebels claim missile attack on Dutch-flagged ship in the Gulf of Aden,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility early on Wednesday for an attack this week that left a Dutch-flagged cargo ship ablaze and adrift in the Gulf of Aden, underlining the range of their weaponry and their campaign targeting shipping over the Israel-Hamas war. The attack on Monday on the Minervagracht was the most serious assault in months by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Gulf of Aden, which is some distance from the Red Sea where they have sunk four vessels since November 2023. It came as Israel engages in a new ground offensive targeting Gaza City and efforts to reach a ceasefire again hang in the balance. Meanwhile, the Middle East also remains on edge after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. The Houthis separately threatened to ""employ all means and instruments available"" to target several American oil firms. The Houthis fired a cruise missile that targeted and struck the Minervagracht, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said. Saree accused the the ship's owners, Amsterdam-based Spliethoff, of violating ""the entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine."" Initially, the U.S. Navy-overseen Joint Maritime Information Center said the Minervagracht had no ties to Israel, but a note Tuesday said the center was ""reviewing vessel affiliations for possible links to Israel."" The attack wounded two mariners on board the Minervagracht, whose 19-member crew hailed from the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine. They were forced to evacuate the ship after the strike inflicted substantial damage. Spliethoff said Wednesday it was working with ""international authorities and salvage experts to safeguard and secure the vessel."" A European naval force operating in the region, known as Operation Aspides, said Tuesday the Minervagracht was on fire and adrift after the crew's rescue. ""We would again like to express our deepest concern over this week's incident which was a direct attack on our innocent seafarers and a breach of the right of free navigation,"" Spliethoff said in a statement. The Houthis have launched missile and drone attacks on over 100 ships and on Israel in response to the war in Gaza, saying they were acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. However, some of the group's targets have had tenuous links or no connections at all to Israel. The Houthi attack widens the area of the rebels' recent assaults, as the last recorded attack on a commercial vessel in the Gulf of Aden before the Minervagracht came in August 2024. Their attacks over the past two years have upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The Houthis stopped their attacks on shipping and Israel itself during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump, before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthi campaign against shipping has killed at least eight mariners and seen four ships sunk. Meanwhile, the Houthis said Wednesday they had levied sanctions against multiple American oil companies, including Chevron Corp, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp., as well as individuals and two ships. The rebels in the past have issued such designations before launching attacks.",ABC News,2025-10-01T09:58:17Z,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-claim-missile-attack-dutch-flagged-126102096,2025-10-01 18:30:13.648894,-0.388235294117647
Bronze Star veteran launches GOP campaign for Massachusetts governor | Today Headline,"When reflecting on his career, Mike Minogue highlights that he's gone from ""soldier to CEO."" Now, the Republican combat veteran and business executive has a new mission as he declares his candidacy for governor in deep blue Massachusetts, where Democratic Gov. Maura Healey is running for re-election next year. In a campaign launch video first shared with Fox News on Wednesday, Minogue said that ""working people have been left behind"" and that Massachusetts' ""current one-party system isn't working. What we need is a new kind of public servant."" FIVE RACES TO WATCH WITH FIVE WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY 2025 ""I'm running to be a new kind of governor, one with the faith, the heart, and the grit to serve,"" Minogue announced. Minogue is a West Point graduate and Airborne Ranger who was awarded a Bronze Star during his service in Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Gulf War. HEAD HERE FOR FOX NEWS' 2025 ELECTION COVERAGE He noted that his military career ""carried me home to Massachusetts, where I became the CEO of Abiomed for 19 years, a public company that built the world's smallest heart pumps."" And the husband and father of five emphasized, ""I've spent my life running towards problems and fixing them, to make a big difference.""

"September VC funding hits $2.19B, reaching $8B for Q3 - Cryptopolitan","IDO remained highly active, raising over $6.7B through leading token sale platforms. Crypto VC funding ended September with a total of $2.19B, with several notable rounds. Investment activity remains lower than average, as funds shift their focus to new projects. Crypto VC funding in September reached a total of $2.19B, on the back of several large-scale deals. Funding activity is lower than average, as investors reconsider their target companies. For the whole of Q3, VC funds raised over $8B for various projects, though the number was inflated by outliers. For most of 2025, seed rounds are declining, while strategic and undisclosed ad-hoc fundraising is growing. Funds no longer seek out hot new tokens, as the market remains oversaturated. Instead, funds prefer late-stage projects. Competition from DAT companies has also skewed fundraising. For September, Coinbase Ventures was the leading fund, involved in seven deals. Animoca Brands, a former leader, has diminished its investment footprint. The USA was the leading region for the past month, with over $700M in deals. Other VC rounds were international, mostly focusing on Southeast Asia and Europe. VC funds still focused on AI projects as the most promising venue, in addition to infrastructure and on-chain tools. VC funding activity serves as a proxy for general market recovery. September's levels were slightly higher than August, with $2B in deals. For the past month, the end result may include additional deals closed a few days later. The month also closed higher thanks to Kraken's self-led round for $500M. The Helius Medical raise for a SOL treasury was also counted toward VC funding rounds. Other prominent rounds included Forward Capital and Inversion Capital for $26.5M. Some of the latest rounds did not have a retail component and were mostly handled by funds, with no public sale component. For retail opportunities, traders turned to the new wave of IDOs. Public funding remained robust, with 155 registered sales and raises. For September, IDO funds raised $6.77B, the second-best month for the year to date. The robust token sale trend hinges on platforms, which aggregate already interested users. For September, Ethereum saw 20 IDOs, with 26 raises on BNB Smart Chain, 18 on Base, and only four on Solana. IDO sales make up over 77% of all raises, with a limited number of high-profile ICOs. The model has displaced VC funding plus public presale, as retail investors seek out projects specifically focusing on a fair public sale. Binance Wallet campaigns had the biggest returns to date, due to the token curation and targeted liquidity events. The Gate Launchpad and Mexc were in the second and third place, with returns of over 130%. The Gate launchpad remained the most diverse one, hosting the largest number of projects from different sectors.",Cryptopolitan,2025-10-01T10:09:02Z,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/september-vc-funding-reaching-8b-for-q3/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.649476,-0.003921568627450966

HART turns over Skyline's new segment to the city | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . Skyline's latest segment, which runs 5.2 miles from the old Aloha Stadium, past the airport to Middle Street in Kalihi, is officially being handed over to the city Department of Transportation Services today. As part of the more than $10-billion, 18.9-mile-long rail project, the new extension, dubbed Segment 2, is scheduled to open for public ridership Oct. 16. But before Skyline's driverless trains could roll for revenue service, the elevated guideway route with four stations, built by Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, had to first undergo a weeks-long testing regime. ""Trial operations, a required two-phase comprehensive testing program conducted by HART and Skyline operator Hitachi Rail Honolulu JV, (HRH), needed to be completed before Segment 2 of the rail system could be certified as ready for passenger service,"" HART Executive Director and CEO Lori Kahikina said. She noted the first phase, trial-running, began July 26, and successfully concluded July 31. ""In this phase, the system underwent a series of operational tests to evaluate overall readiness,"" she said. The second phase, the system service availability demonstration, began Aug. 2, and successfully concluded Sept. 13, she added. ""In this phase, HRH was required to operate the system at an average service availability of 98.5% over a rolling 30-day period,"" Kahikina said. DTS helped oversee the train trials. ""DTS provided an over-the-shoulder review with HART throughout the entire testing period,"" Travis Ota, the department's information specialist, said. ""Once this process was complete, HART transferred the assets to DTS through a capital asset transfer."" Now, the city awaits Segment 2's formal opening date. ""The public will be able to ride Skyline between Kualakai East Kapolei and Kahauiki Kalihi Transit Center Station on Middle Street starting at 4 a.m."" Oct. 16, Ota said. ""Regular operations continue on the 16th and 17th, and riders will need to pay their fares with loaded HOLO cards to enter stations and board TheBus."" DTS plans a fare-free weekend for Skyline, TheBus and TheHandi-Van on Saturday, Oct. 18, and Sunday, Oct. 19, he said. ""Riders wishing to ride free will still need a HOLO card to enter stations or board TheBus,"" Ota said. ""However, no funds will be deducted from HOLO cards."" He noted the new extension will provide service to major employment centers on Oahu, including Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, the Mapunapuna and Lagoon Drive industrial area, and the Kalihi Transit Center on Middle Street. ""With this five-mile, four-station addition, Skyline now connects riders to and from major destinations, for work or play,"" Ota said. ""With Segment 2, Skyline service hours will also expand to 4 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily, including weekends and holidays."" Alongside Skyline's expansion, DTS says it will launch new, rapid TheBus lines to improve connectivity to and from Chinatown, Downtown Honolulu, Kakaako, Ala Moana, Waikiki and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. New bus routes include: >> A Line: Frequent, limited-stop service between Ahua Lagoon Drive Skyline Station and UH Manoa. Replaces Route A, with 10-minute peak frequency. >> U Line: Expedited service between Ahua Lagoon Drive Skyline Station and UH Manoa/Kaimuki via H-1 freeway. Runs every 60 minutes, with additional peak-hour trips on weekdays. >> W Line: Frequent, limited-stop service between Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and Waikiki. Replaces Route 20, with 10-minute peak frequency. According to Ota, Segment 2's addition further expands the city rail's assets. ""There will be a total of seven trains running between East Kapolei and Kalihi Transit Center at once, when Segment 2 begins operations,"" he said. ""There are a total of 20 trains in the fleet."" Still, DTS expects more work will need to be done prior to the next phase's official opening. ""HART will construct and install a new bus stop fronting the mauka entrance to the Lelepaua Daniel K. Inouye International Airport station before opening day,"" Ota said. ""This new bus stop will allow residents and visitors easy access between Skyline and the new W Line to and from Waikiki."" But, according to Kahikina, the bulk of the Segment 2 construction is completed. ""With the exception of a few minor, non-safety critical punch list items, there are no outstanding issues or concerns,"" she said. Meanwhile, Segment 2's construction -- like much of the city's long overdue, over-budget rail project -- was neither smooth nor inexpensive. In July 2023, the project's prime contractor, Shimmick/Traylor/Granite Joint Venture, or STG, filed a more than $99.1 million lawsuit in 1st Circuit Court against HART for alleged unpaid extra time and work. The contractor claimed HART failed to compensate the joint venture for delays stemming from a prematurely issued contract, and problems with utility relocation work that were beyond the company's control and held up its work building the rail line toward Kalihi. In 2016, HART awarded STG its original $875 million contract to build the rail line from areas east of Halawa to Kalihi, officials noted. But by December 2023, HART boosted its work contract with Segment 2's builder to nearly $1 billion to settle the lawsuit. At that time, HART's board of directors voted to approve a proposed settlement with STG for more than $59.9 million. That approval, considered a change order under what was termed a ""global settlement agreement,"" meant the builder's contract -- then at more than $930 million -- would be increased to a total contract price of $990 million. In exchange, STG agreed to finish the airport route by early 2024. Kahikina confirmed this week that HART's ""current contract value"" with STG is still $990 million. Overall, she explained that completing Segment 2 marks an important milestone. ""Our original schedule had us finishing in December 2025, but, at the mayor's direction, we pulled together and made it happen by October,"" Kahikina said. ""I'm so thankful to be surrounded by such a hardworking, dedicated team who gave their all to deliver on this goal.""",Honolulu Star Advertiser,2025-10-01T10:05:00Z,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/01/hawaii-news/hart-turns-over-skylines-new-segment-to-the-city/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.650596,0.1686274509803922

"Whistleblower claims leveled against PUC exec unfounded, inquiry finds | Honolulu Star-Advertiser","Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . The majority of allegations that the attorney serving as the Public Utilities Commission's chief of policy and research is unqualified and created a toxic work environment were found to be unsubstantiated by state investigators. According to a Sept. 11 letter from the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs obtained by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, a ""significant majority of the issues were found to be unsubstantiated."" On Sept. 10, DCCA received a Confidential Workplace Investigation Report from a consultant hired to look into allegations raised in an anonymous letter to state lawmakers in June. The letter alleged that Randy Baldemor intimidated and berated staff and described a temper that left staff reporting directly to him fearful. The anonymous letter, titled ""Whistleblower Complaining About the Public Utilities Commission,"" alleged that Baldemor was hired by PUC Chair Leo Asuncion, who announced at a December 2024 holiday party that he was hiring Baldemor as his top aide and that ""Randy also lives in Hawaii Kai and they barbeque together with HECO (Hawaiian Electric Co.) executives."" The letter to lawmakers alleged that Baldemor had ""zero experience working in electric, gas, water, wastewater, and/or telecommunications industries"" or with Young Brothers. He was accused of using his position at the PUC to create programs that benefited his former private sector employer. The anonymous letter led to a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection. In the Sept. 11 letter from DCCA director Nadine Y. Ando, she wrote that during the two-month probe into the allegations the investigator had identified ""20 issues based on the allegations"" made in the complaint. ""None of the issues identified were found to be substantiated as a whole. A significant majority of the issues were found to be unsubstantiated. In the case of the few issues that were found to be substantiated in part (there were only 5) the partial facts substantiated were not considered to be determinative of the overall claim or issue,"" wrote Ando. ""In sum, it was specifically found that Randy Baldemor and Leo Asuncion, as well as the PUC Personnel officer who oversaw the hiring process related to Randy Baldemor's hiring, had not violated any DCCA or state policies. DCCA, therefore, considers the matter closed."" Baldemor, in a statement to the Star-Advertiser, said he was on an approved vacation June. 24 when the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection published and held a hearing on an ""anonymous, unsigned letter containing unsubstantiated allegations against me and the Public Utilities Commission."" ""Certain news organizations reported on the hearing, further spreading these claims,"" said Baldemor, noting the DCCA found no violations of state policies related to the allegations. ""Rather than allowing due process for workplace investigations, the Senate Committee chose to publish anonymous claims without verification. Anonymous, unverified claims exploited through government channels and amplified by the media erode public trust, undermine responsible governance, and disrupt the workplace,"" he said. ""I take due process and my responsibility as a public servant seriously. It is an honor to serve at an agency shaping policy to improve the lives of Hawaii's people, alongside dedicated colleagues committed to the work needed in these challenging times."" Baldemor previously held public service leadership positions at the Hawai'i Tourism Authority, and as the deputy director at the Department of Human Resources Development, director of strategic initiatives at the governor's office, deputy director with the state Department of Taxation, and deputy chief information officer for the Office of Information Management and Technology. He resigned as HTA's chief operating officer in March 2018 after an ethics investigation resulted in a $6,000 fine. In December 2017, the Hawaii State Ethics Commission fined Baldemor and three other HTA executives a combined $12,000 for violating the state ethics code by accepting, and sometimes soliciting, airline upgrades for business trips between 2014 and 2016. Baldemor accepted six business-class flight upgrades during official travel to Japan, China and Europe and a hotel upgrade from Starwood and ""did not report any of the above flight upgrades that he accepted by filing a Gifts Disclosure Statement with the Commission by the statutory deadline of June 30, 2016,"" according to the commission's Oct. 17, 2017, findings. Baldemor argued and the commission agreed that HTA employees had a custom or practice of soliciting courtesy upgrades from airlines, and that this custom or practice ""pre-dated his tenure with HTA"" that began in 2015. Baldemor did not file gift reports for any of the flight upgrades as ""required by HRS § 84-11.5 until after the Commission notified HTA of its investigation in September 2016"" and the commission found that Baldemor ""likely violated the Gifts Reporting Law."" The commission also questioned HTA hotel upgrades in a Dec. 14, 2017, memo that said it appeared HTA personnel were choosing hotels and then executing a tailored comparison search to make it appear their selection was the least expensive. An Ohio native, Baldemor earned a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Florida and got his law degree from the University of Washington's Law School. He also earned an interdisciplinary graduate certificate from the Global Trade, Transportation and Logistics Studies Program at the University of Washington.",Honolulu Star Advertiser,2025-10-01T10:05:00Z,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/01/hawaii-news/whistleblower-claims-leveled-against-puc-exec-unfounded-inquiry-finds/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.652964,0.02745098039215677
"Kerala LoP VD Satheesan Alleges Rs 1100 Crore GST Scam, Calls it ""Tip of Iceberg""","Kerala opposition leader VD Satheesan has alleged a massive GST scam involving Rs 1100 crore in fraudulent transactions, resulting in a Rs 200 crore loss to the state. He accused the government of shielding corrupt officials and demanded a CBI probe. Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala opposition leader VD Satheesan has leveled serious allegations against the state government, claiming that a massive scam linked to GST fraud has come to light. Speaking to the media, he described the revelations as ""shocking,"" pointing out that a single gang was behind fraudulent transactions amounting to Rs 1100 crore. Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred SourceAllegations of Large-Scale GST Fraud According to Satheesan, registrations were carried out using the names of unsuspecting common people without their knowledge, while the fraudulent financial transactions were routed through the scamsters' own accounts. He noted that while the Pune Intelligence Unit managed to uncover the scam, the state's response was limited to canceling the registrations. Highlighting the gravity of the issue, the opposition leader said that the direct loss to the exchequer stands at Rs 200 crore-money which has not yet been recovered. Adding to the concern, he said the defrauded individuals were never informed about the manipulation of their details. Satheesan warned that this could be the visible part of a much larger network, with unofficial reports suggesting nearly 1,000 similar scams may be operating. ""The GST system is collapsing. What we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg. There are no effective safeguards to prevent fraudulent registrations, no foolproof mechanisms in place,"" Satheesan said, adding that the situation amounts to both tax fraud and data theft. He went further to allege that sections of GST officials themselves have links with the fraudsters, accusing the government of deliberately shielding these officials. To ensure accountability, the opposition leader demanded a CBI investigation into the scam. Gold Plating Controversy Satheesan also raised fresh questions regarding the gold plating controversy at temples under the Devaswom boards. Referring to the gold plating that was done in 1999 with a ""40-year guarantee,"" he asked why it was showing signs of fading now and why no inquiry had been initiated despite proof of weight reduction. He further demanded transparency by calling for an inquiry into the role of sponsors on Devaswom boards, insisting that the matter cannot be brushed aside. The opposition leader's press conference thus combined two sharp criticisms-allegations of a GST scam reflecting poor governance and corruption, and the long-unresolved issue of gold plating mismanagement.

Will Taiwan move half its chip manufacturing to the US? Apparently not,"Taiwan has rejected the idea of producing 50 percent of its semiconductors in the United States, according to the island's top tariff negotiator, amid growing pressure from Washington for increased chip manufacturing on American soil. Speaking in Taipei on Wednesday, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun responded to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's suggestion of a 50-50 production split between Taiwan and the US. ""I want to clarify that this is the US's idea. Our negotiation team has never made a 50-50 commitment to a chip split,"" Cheng told reporters in Taipei, according to CBS19 News. ""Please be rest assured that we did not discuss this issue this time, and we will not agree to such a condition,"" she said. Taiwanese official Cheng recently returned from Washington, confirming that negotiations over new US tariffs on Taiwanese shipments ""made some progress."" This comes as Taiwan scrambles to finalise a tariff agreement with the US following President Donald Trump's administration imposing a temporary 20% levy that has alarmed local manufacturers. The tension is amplified by Taiwan's booming technology exports. Soaring global demand for AI-related technology has fueled Taiwan's trade surplus with the US, putting it directly ""in Trump's crosshairs."" Trump has also threatened to impose a ""fairly substantial tariff"" specifically on imported semiconductors. As the island's cabinet noted, more than 70% of Taiwan's exports to the US consist of information and communications technology, including these critical chips. In an attempt to avoid the tariffs, Taipei has made several commitments: increasing investment in the US, buying more American energy, and boosting its own defense spending to over 3% of GDP. This delicate trade situation is tied to the concept of the ""silicon shield,"" as Taiwan produces more than half of the world's semiconductors and nearly all of the high-end ones. This concentration of manufacturing has long been viewed as a deterrent against potential aggression from China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, and as a powerful incentive for the US to defend the island. However, a US sentiment shift toward domestic production is evident. In a recent interview, Lutnick stated that moving 50% of Taiwan's chip production to the United States would ensure, ""we have the capacity to do what we need to do if we need to do it."" Lutnick confirmed the ongoing pressure on Taipei, stating, ""That has been the conversation we've had with Taiwan, that you have to understand that it's vital for you to have us produce 50 percent.""",Firstpost,2025-10-01T10:03:06Z,https://www.firstpost.com/world/will-taiwan-move-half-its-chip-manufacturing-to-the-us-apparently-not-13938460.html,2025-10-01 18:30:13.653574,-0.04313725490196074

What You Need to Know About Annuities,"Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance and retirement planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: How do income annuities work, and how they are different from investing in something that pays out income like bonds? A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond. They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what's called ""longevity risk pooling,"" which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you're the one who lives to be 99, you're the winner in that situation. That's one reason that payouts are higher than you'd see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can't get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end. Q: How can these types of annuities help with retirement planning? A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household's basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses -- housing, taxes, healthcare -- total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That's an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it. Q: Savings annuities, or ""deferred annuities,"" allow investors to get market exposure in addition to income. What are some key savings annuity types? A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you're in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular ""fixed index"" annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum. Q: These products are more complicated than income annuities, and they carry more risk and higher costs. How can investors make sure they know what they're getting into with these products? A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into. At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn't there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you're getting with this product that you couldn't get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don't sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they're able to make good on whatever promises they're making. Q: What are the tax implications of annuities? A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you'll owe taxes on any money that hasn't been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate. _____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Sarajevo International Airport Meets EU Standards In Security Context - Sarajevo Times,"Sarajevo International Airport in May this year took over the duties of counter-sabotage inspection from the Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and so far more than 500.000 pieces of hand luggage have been inspected, and more than 75.000 required additional inspection. However, as stated by Sarajevo Airport, not a single case has been recorded that would endanger the safety of passengers, staff, or flights. In this way, Sarajevo Airport proves that safety is not a matter of status, but of principles and systems, and in a security context can match many airports in the European Union (EU). Based on available information, through the Baggage Handling System (BHS) from the beginning of the year until the end of August, more than 450.000 checked pieces of luggage were processed, and more than 40.000 of them were sent for manual inspection. As a result, almost 10.000 prohibited items were removed from luggage, which further confirms a serious security approach in all operations. These data also confirm that Sarajevo Airport, although BiH is not a member of the EU, has not received a single complaint from other airports that luggage inspected at our airport was poorly inspected, thereby confirming the highest level of security and quality of work. ""With the increase in traffic volume (by the end of this year, more than 2.000.000 passengers are expected), we are aware that potential challenges are also increasing. We encounter different situations which, within the framework of civil aviation at the airport, in the largest number of cases, we mark as events. In the past period, none of these events endangered the safety of the airport, and therefore not the safety of passengers. All these events were resolved efficiently, with full cooperation and coordination with the Border Police Unit and the Customs Office. We did not call them incidents because most often these are situations when passengers, due to haste, lack of information, or sometimes negligence, come to the airport and in their luggage have items that cannot be brought onto the airplane. Such items we confiscate, but we leave passengers the possibility of reclaiming them, if the items are not of such nature that they require further support of the Border Police Unit,"" they emphasize from the Airport. For actual incidents, which can be marked as a potential danger, the Airport has appropriate plans and readiness of the responsible services to reduce risk and prevent possible escalation. The Airport is also not immune to false threatening reports, but everything is assessed in an emergency procedure, and with planned action declared harmless. Incidents are usually marked as ""abandoned luggage"" or ""unattended luggage,"" and in all cases were declared harmless by the Border Police Unit. ""When it comes to goods, we rarely encounter shipments that can be classified as prohibited or goods smuggled through the airport. We believe the reason for this is that senders, through freight forwarders and other entities, are usually beforehand informed about what can and cannot be transported by air,"" they state from Sarajevo Airport. The airport operator, as they add, possesses appropriate security equipment and conducts security screening of all goods and mail intended for export through the airport, which is certainly another reason why Sarajevo Airport is avoided as an option for potential smuggling. In terms of the type of processed goods through the Cargo Center of the Public Enterprise International Airport ""Sarajevo"", to the greatest extent, products of the pharmaceutical, defense, and automotive industry are processed for export, as well as valuable shipments of commercial banks and biological substances such as blood samples, stem cells, and similar. The average amount of cargo processed through the Cargo Center J.P. Sarajevo International Airport d.o.o. Sarajevo in the past three years (2022-2024) amounts to 2.723 tons, of which 89.3% (2.443 tons) accounts for cargo shipments, while the remaining 10.3% (280 tons) are postal shipments, mostly of public postal operators in the Federation of BiH (FBiH).

Ashaiman rocked by fire incident as inferno destroys over 100 structures,"Don't miss out! Get your daily dose of sports news straight to your phone. Join YEN's Sports News channel on WhatsApp now! A massive fire gutted parts of the Ashaiman Light Industrial Area in the early hours of Tuesday, September 30. The fire destroyed over 100 wooden structures, a car and two metal containers. The Ghana National Fire Service, in a Facebook post, said it took about an hour to bring the fire under control. ""The distress call was received at 03:31 hrs, firefighters arrived at the scene at 03:38 hrs to confine the fire at 04:13 hrs. The blaze was brought under control at 04:36 hrs, and finally extinguished at 06:35 hrs."" The service said it was able to save more than 20 wooden structures, several containers, and eight vehicles. There were also no injuries or fatalities recorded during the incident. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, with the fire service urging calm as they carry out a full assessment of the incident. In August, a fire broke out at the Suame Post Office market in the Ashanti Region, destroying about 300 shops. In that instance, traders and residents claimed firefighters arrived at the scene too late to prevent major losses. The official cause of the remains unknown, according to Adom News. Also in August, a fire outbreak at Madina Redco left several traders counting their losses after shops were destroyed. In July, one of Kumasi's popular radio stations, Pure FM, went off air after a fierce overnight fire destroyed its studio equipment. According to eyewitnesses, the July 23 fire, which occurred late in the night, took over three hours to be brought under control. In April, residents of Tse Addo in the La Dade-Kotopon Municipality were left counting their losses after a raging fire destroyed parts of their community. Properties worth millions were destroyed by the residential inferno on April 15, 2025. Reports indicated that the fire hit the community during the night, leaving residents in the community devastated. The cause of the fire is yet to be made public. Fire officers responded to the incident, but their efforts were in vain as the blaze had already destroyed many properties. This proposal came in the wake of documented struggles of the fire service during the Adum fire in Kumasi.

"Exporters remain optimistic on overseas trade, survey finds","Almost all Enterprise Ireland client companies looking at new markets in response to US moves on tariffs Most Irish exporters are optimistic about expansion over the next year despite ongoing challenges in global trade, a new survey has found. The Enterprise Ireland data said 97 per cent of exporters expect to expand into new markets, while two-thirds believe their export sales will increase this year and 93 per cent are expecting growth in 2026. It comes despite evidence of a dampening in demand among exporters for the second consecutive month in September, according to the latest AIB purchasing managers' index. Optimism is strongest in the technology and services sector where 70 per cent of Enterprise Ireland clients foresee an uplift in exports this year, followed by 60 per cent of industrial and life sciences firms. Among the top targets in terms of markets for the companies are the euro zone, with the UK and US following. However, a number of challenges were identified by Enterprise Ireland client companies, including global uncertainty due to regulations and tariffs, the cost of doing business and staff retention. To help counter that, 98 per cent of businesses said they were taking steps to improve competitiveness. Almost 90 per cent said they are integrating or planning to integrate AI into their business operations. Companies are divided on the potential impact of US tariffs, with 49 per cent expecting a negative impact. Exporters say they are responding by diversifying into new markets, securing new customers and reviewing supply chains. ""While Irish businesses are navigating trade policies changes, there is growing reason for optimism, and this is reflected in the results of Enterprise Ireland's IMW survey,"" Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, Peter Burke, said. ""It is encouraging to see that in response to geopolitical volatility, many Irish companies have accelerated their digital strategies and are expanding into new markets. These changes will enhance the productivity and competitiveness of Irish SMEs."" Enterprise Ireland chief executive Jenny Melia said the optimism and ambition shown by Irish exporters was ""hugely encouraging."" ""Almost every company we surveyed is taking action to strengthen competitiveness, and many see AI and digitalisation as key assets in winning new international business,"" she said.

EEOC Sues Apple Over Alleged Firing of Jewish Employee Who Observed the Sabbath,"How Walmart Plans to Prepare America's Largest Private Workforce for an AI-Driven Future EEOC Sues Apple Over Alleged Firing of Jewish Employee Who Observed the Sabbath By: Fern Sidman The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has launched a high-profile legal battle against Apple, accusing the technology giant of religious discrimination and retaliation against a Jewish employee at its Reston, Virginia, retail store. The case, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the caption EEOC v. Apple, Inc. (No. 1:25-cv-1637), centers on claims that Apple refused to accommodate the man's Sabbath observance and ultimately terminated him in January 2024. According to a report that appeared on Tuesday at VIN News, the lawsuit represents one of the most significant clashes between religious liberty protections and corporate scheduling practices in recent years, with potential implications far beyond Apple's famed glass storefronts. The employee, whose name has not been disclosed in public filings, worked for Apple for 16 years, making him one of the longest-serving members of the Reston store staff. VIN News reported that his conversion to Judaism in 2023 became a turning point in his professional trajectory. Upon adopting Orthodox observance, he asked his new store manager to excuse him from work on Fridays and Saturdays so that he could fully observe the Jewish Sabbath. Apple allegedly denied the request, citing uniform scheduling policies that it claimed applied to all employees. The complaint, however, underscores that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires employers to make ""reasonable accommodations"" for religious observances unless doing so creates an ""undue hardship"" on the business. Shortly after his request was denied, the longtime employee began facing discipline. The VIN News report noted that Apple cited him for grooming violations, a move that attorneys now argue was pretextual and retaliatory. Matters came to a head in January 2024, when Apple terminated his employment -- mere days after he renewed his plea for accommodation. The EEOC's public statements make clear the gravity with which the agency views the case. ""Employees should not have to violate their religious beliefs to keep their jobs,"" said Debra Lawrence, Regional Attorney for the EEOC, in a statement quoted in the VIN News report. The lawsuit contends that Apple's actions constituted a direct violation of Title VII, which not only prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion but also bars retaliation against employees who request accommodations. By disciplining and ultimately firing the employee, the EEOC alleges, Apple punished him for exercising his federally protected rights. The VIN News report highlighted that the lawsuit follows unsuccessful attempts at mediation and settlement between the EEOC and Apple. Typically, the EEOC prefers to resolve disputes through conciliation before escalating matters to court. That negotiations collapsed in this case suggests, according to legal experts, that the parties' positions were irreconcilable. Now, with the lawsuit filed in federal court, the stakes are far higher. If Apple loses, it could face not only financial damages but also injunctive relief requiring the company to change its policies on scheduling, religious accommodation, and retaliation prevention. As of press time, Apple has not publicly commented on the litigation. Requests for statements from VIN News reporters went unanswered, though Apple has historically positioned itself as a progressive company on issues of diversity and inclusion. This silence has only intensified scrutiny. How could a corporation that has branded itself as a champion of personal freedom and equity be accused of failing to protect a fundamental religious right enshrined in federal law? The lawsuit arrives at a time when courts and regulators are increasingly attentive to the boundaries between corporate operations and religious rights. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the meaning of ""undue hardship"" in religious accommodation cases, raising the bar for employers who deny accommodations on the grounds of inconvenience or cost. VIN News reported that this precedent could loom large in EEOC v. Apple. For decades, employers argued that even modest disruptions constituted an undue hardship. But recent rulings have narrowed that interpretation, requiring businesses to demonstrate that accommodating religious observance would cause significant difficulty or expense. Applied to the Reston case, this standard may work against Apple, which is unlikely to argue credibly that adjusting one employee's Friday and Saturday shifts would cripple operations in a store staffed by dozens. At the heart of the lawsuit is the sanctity of the Jewish Sabbath, which requires observant Jews to refrain from work and commerce from sundown Friday through sundown Saturday. The report at VIN News explained that this observance is not merely a preference but a core religious commandment, non-negotiable for Orthodox Jews. The EEOC complaint highlights that Apple's refusal forced the employee into an impossible bind: choose between livelihood and faith. Legal analysts say such scenarios are precisely what Title VII was designed to prevent. The case is not limited to accommodation alone. VIN News reported that the EEOC is equally focused on claims of retaliation. The timing of the employee's discipline and termination -- coming immediately after renewed requests for Sabbath accommodation -- raises red flags. Retaliation cases often hinge on evidence of suspicious timing, disparate treatment, or pretextual justifications. In this instance, grooming violations cited against a 16-year veteran may strike jurors as selective enforcement, especially when juxtaposed with his prior record of service. Jewish advocacy groups have been quick to seize on the case as emblematic of a larger struggle for religious freedom in the workplace. The report at VIN News noted that several Orthodox organizations have pledged to monitor proceedings closely, viewing them as a litmus test for the strength of federal protections. ""This is not just about one man in Virginia,"" said one communal leader. ""It's about whether observant Jews, or any religious people, can bring their whole selves to work without fear of reprisal."" The case is expected to move forward in the coming months with pretrial motions and potential discovery into Apple's internal policies, scheduling records, and disciplinary histories. VIN News reported that the court could also hear testimony from managers, co-workers, and experts on religious accommodation. If the EEOC prevails, remedies could include back pay, compensatory damages, and an order requiring Apple to implement more robust religious accommodation policies across its U.S. operations. Conversely, if Apple successfully defends itself, it could set a precedent narrowing the scope of religious rights in corporate workplaces. Ultimately, the lawsuit against Apple is about far more than one employee's Sabbath observance. It is about the enduring tension between America's most powerful corporations and the civil rights protections that safeguard its workers. The VIN News report emphasized that for Apple, which touts a brand synonymous with innovation and inclusivity, the optics of fighting against a Jewish employee's right to observe the Sabbath could prove damaging, whatever the legal outcome. As the case proceeds, it will test not only the strength of federal statutes like Title VII but also the willingness of corporations to align their public values with their internal practices. In the words of Debra Lawrence, as cited in the VIN News report: ""No one should be forced to choose between their faith and their job. That is not only the law; it is the principle of a free society.""",The Jewish Voice,2025-10-01T10:03:25Z,https://tjvnews.com/business-a-technology/eeoc-sues-apple-over-alleged-firing-of-jewish-employee-who-observed-the-sabbath/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.657707,-0.03529411764705881
HKFP Lens: Hong Kong runs red with patriotism on China's 76th National Day,"Tsim Sha Tsui's harbourfront ran red with patriotic displays on Wednesday to mark the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

This is why your Starbucks just closed - The Boston Globe,"As she passed the store on the way to work, she was dismayed to see its windows papered over. When she texted her husband to lament, he had more bad news: His local Starbucks at Rowes Wharf had also shuttered. Across Greater Boston, consumers have been forced to change up their coffee routines this week after Starbucks announced it was closing 19 local shops. The shuttering of about 400 stores in the United States and Canada is part of a larger $1 billion restructuring effort that also included laying off 900 corporate employees. It's the latest, deepest round of cost-cutting after years of waning sales, longer wait times, and higher prices that have alienated customers of the once-ubiquitous coffee giant. But more than that, said CEO Brian Niccol, it reflects a desire to bring the soul back to Starbucks, shedding underperforming stores and focusing on creating the best experience they can at the rest. The chain's decision to cut back at this moment has left industry insiders reading the tea leaves (or coffee beans, if you will) as they interpret what the move means. Is it a sign of looming recession? A real estate play? A reaction to tariffs? Or does it signify the death of the ""third place"" role between work and home that Starbucks had long embraced? In truth, it's a bit of all of the above, said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University's Nolan School of Hotel Administration. ""Starbucks is a phenomenon and they have been since their inception,"" he said. ""From a third-place perspective, the pandemic really changed the dynamic of how people engaged in these types of places. Consumer behavior changed, and Starbucks needed to figure out how to compete in that space."" Ron Shaich, the Brookline-based founder of Panera and Au Bon Pain, who is now the lead investor in the Tatte, Life Alive, and Cava chains, said that previous Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson focused on integrating apps and online orders to maintain a level of service during the COVID-19 pandemic. But in the process, he turned the chain into ""an adult beverage machine with a digital front."" ""It became an automat,"" Shaich said. While digital tools may expedite lines and drive loyalty from customers like Querzoli, they removed some of the personal touches that Starbucks had long been known for -- details like having baristas hand-write customers' names on cups, a move that Niccol re-introduced this year to mixed results. ""They essentially cannibalized their in-store experiences,"" Shaich said. ""It was very clear that Starbucks had lost its differentiation and its specialness. It wasn't a third place, it was the antithesis of it."" The coffee landscape has also changed dramatically, said George Howell, the owner of the eponymous local chain, who sold his earlier concept, The Coffee Connection, to Starbucks in 1994 for $23 million. Today, he said, there's any number of ""third wave"" specialty coffee shops in the city, both independents and higher-end chains with ambiance and ample seating like Blank Street and Caffè Nero. There's obviously no shortage of Dunkins around here for those who want a quick cup on the run, and Chinese chain Luckin Coffee is making a big push into the United States in an attempt to go toe-to-toe with Starbucks. ""They're getting squeezed at both ends,"" Howell said. The decision by Starbucks is likely also a real estate play, Howell said. In a moment when coffee prices are climbing rapidly and commercial real estate valuations are plummeting, it makes sense to reassess underperforming stores and exit pricey leases. The question, Howell wondered, was how Starbucks can continue to claim dominance without being in key locations like Harvard or Davis Squares. ""They are talking about going back to being what they used to be, but they have removed themselves from so many central locations,"" he said. ""That's surprising to me."" Some also interpret the move to close stores as an emboldened act, pushing back against recent labor activity that's led to the unionization of 650 stores nationwide. Five of the stores that were closed locally were unionized, including the locations in Harvard Square, Cleveland Circle, and at 874 Commonwealth Ave. near Boston University, where workers held a lengthy strike in 2022. It's happening in a moment when corporate America seems to be taking a more hostile stance against labor organizing, said Clare Hammonds, a professor of labor studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While Starbucks didn't exclusively shut down unionized shops, she said, the decision to close several of them will likely have a chilling effect on organizing efforts. ""Companies often claim when workers unionize that this is going to cause such financial strain,"" she said. ""Now you can make that argument even more forcefully."" Starbucks Workers United said last Thursday that the closures were made without input from Starbucks' baristas. It's planning a rally this weekend in Harvard Square to continue to push for the company to better support its workers. ""Fixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out,"" the union said in a statement. As for Querzoli, she's adjusting to a new reality as she rethinks her coffee commute strategy. ""Now I have to be extra prepared in the morning,"" she said, and will have to go out of her way to find another Starbucks, or be prepared to ""fight all of the other Charlestown moms"" for her morning cup.",The Boston Globe,2025-10-01T10:08:05Z,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/01/business/starbucks-closing-boston-why/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.658436,-0.05098039215686279
Navigating FX Risk in the Age of Tariffs,"Ever since the turn of the century, consumers around the have enjoyed a world with plenty of commercial options and access. Globalization, the force behind making countries more dependent on each other, brought along a period of tremendous efficiency and built a network of manufacturers and service providers that transcended national geography and resource limitations. Going back to the origins of international trade, Ricardian theory posits that it is best for countries to work with one another, focus and specialize on what they can produce best, and trade accordingly to make for a wealthier society. However, the benefits of such a system are now being more scrutinized than ever, with political power battles now embedded with challenges to the status quo. Read also: Strong Economic Data Masks Growing Strains from 2025 Tariffs Some proponents have suggested the entire enterprise has been a mistake, and vast inequality is evidence that policies need to provide fixes. Historically, tariffs have been one way to take a step back from facilitating trade, with the intention of protecting and closely managing developments for industries. Today, tariffs have been imposed in large part to decouple the United States from China, particularly when it comes to technology and the advancement of sophisticated semiconductors which can be crucial to the safety and protection of national security. As the current U.S. administration sees it, it is highly risky to rely on and coordinate with China's tech firms, as these are trying to dominate the global arena. More importantly, there is a push to do more locally and rely less on anything made by countries that aren't aligned with U.S. interests. In a new method of negotiating better trade terms and making concessions involving political goals, the U.S. is using tariffs. They are alternatives to financial sanctions, used temporarily and tied to deadlines that can be delayed. While it confuses markets, the idiosyncrasy of it all has created opportunities for other nations. Many countries have desired better terms with the U.S. for a long time-or to be perceived as acceptable substitutes to China for critical energy sources and low-cost manufacturing. Since the U.S-Dollar centered system has been shaken, the instability of the Buck has made for opportunities in the Emerging-Market currency pairs and given muti-year highs to majors. The Euro, for example, has hit its best point in four years. The Dollar Index (DXY) suffered a terrible first half of the year, showing the weakest 6-month period since the trackers' invention in 1973. Tariffs are not typically perceived as an instrument that fosters growth, but rather as a ""tax"" that can break the business equation for several firms. This led to a loss in economic momentum that registered a contraction in Q1 of half a percent and has slowed down 2025's average economic growth from 2.5% in 2024 to 1.25% now. The latter figure was achieved thanks to a 3.0% reading in Q2. Since the Buck has proven vulnerable to deep losses, vendors in other nations that had never asked to be paid in their local tender are now demanding a way to receive payment in something other than just USDs. This has in turn made companies more conscientious of their Net-Landed cost, the total cost of delivery that includes charges in duties, shipping, as well as conversions. More than ever, we have seen companies plan ahead with Forward Instruments, contracts that can safeguard a price for a period down the line and be hedged until maturity when a fixing settles the total balance. These instruments are for non-Majors such as Indian Rupee (INR), Philippine Peso (PHP), Brazilian Real (BRL), Colombian Peso (COP), and even frontier currencies such as Vietnamese Dong (VND). As far as the ability to foresee where things are going, there geopolitical concerns, especially about the escalation of armed conflicts in the Middle East and the intense war of Russia and Ukraine. Following FX flows will demand more out of participants who will have to be specific about their area or region of interest as tariffs will have blanket effects as well as unique consequences to certain partnerships. We have already witnessed trade agreements between the U.S. and the EU as well as Japan be accepted, but the details of the terms remain a point of contest within the policymakers of these economies. While Mexico and Canada try to remain friendly with the U.S., the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is likely to be scrutinized and perhaps there will be calls for changes. Since the guidance has been blurry, forecasting long-term has become very difficult. We must also take into account that central bank policy decisions may no longer cause the same effect as before, something we have witnessed in 2025 as the first half of the year did not result in currency value losses for the Euro (EUR) nor Mexican Peso (MXN) after the European Central Bank and Bank of Mexico (Banxico) both exercised rounds of loosening by cutting interest rates. Following the Fed's announcement on September 17th, there were no promises of lowering borrowing costs regardless of the pains in ""stagflation,"" a phenomenon where economic growth is hard to find while prices remain stubbornly upwardly trending. The event resulted in a ""hawkish cut,"" meaning that the Fed slashed as expected, but sounded too confident to assume they will be stimulus-driven going forward as well as worried about inflation being elevated. It leaves the narrative for the Dollar still quite mixed. Because nothing has been consistent, volatility has made us pivotal in helping clients adjust rapidly and intake information that matters while separating from what is just noise. Turbulent times or times of change may bring with them a sense of desperation and perhaps impotence, but we have the ability to use good banking relationships to minimize risk and more importantly, make sure that payments and business flow smoothly. We are prepared to take on the commercial impact. Ultimately, we are a bridge connecting all out there, that has solid foundations and has handled the weight of consequences well even after the pandemic shocks. Expect American relations to play a major role going forward as well as the need to understand the sustainability of BRICS as a long-term adversary for leverage. Remember, the ugly part about tariffs is that they come with retaliation.",Global Trade Magazine,2025-10-01T09:00:55Z,https://www.globaltrademag.com/navigating-fx-risk-in-the-age-of-tariffs/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.659070,0.3254901960784313

It applies AI and machine learning (ML) tools to clients' data for applications such as predictive analytics, threat detection, facial recognition, and biometrics, among others. Though the company points out that it is present in multiple areas such as defense, intelligence, border security, travel, hospitality, manufacturing, and supply chain, the bulk of its revenue comes from government contracts. The similarity that BigBear.ai's business has to that of Palantir's explains why investors have been buying this stock hand over fist. But then, a closer look will tell us that BigBear.ai's stock price surge isn't justified by its poor financial performance. The company reported an 18% year-over-year decline in its revenue in Q2 to just under $40 million. Management attributed this sharp drop to ""lower volume on certain Army programs,"" which tells us that its reliance on federal contracts for a big chunk of its revenue isn't paying off. Moreover, BigBear.ai's margins shrank, and its losses increased on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, Palantir is enjoying outstanding growth in its business by attracting both commercial and government customers. This clearly suggests that BigBear.ai isn't finding much traction in the fast-growing AI software market. Additionally, the company's revenue backlog indicates that it doesn't have much visibility going forward as well. That's because only a small portion of its backlog is funded. Almost 95% of the $380 million backlog it reported at the end of Q2 is either unfunded or unexercised, which means it will only be recognized as actual revenue if its customers decide to buy its solutions. We have already seen that BigBear.ai struggled last quarter thanks to lower demand from a key government customer, which also forced it to lower its 2025 guidance. In fact, BigBear.ai's top line is set to drop by double-digit percentages this year, suggesting that it may find it difficult to deliver more upside to investors, especially considering that its price-to-sales ratio of 12 is on the expensive side. While Bigbear.ai is finding it difficult to grow its business despite operating in a lucrative market, SoundHound AI isn't facing any such problem. The company's revenue in the second quarter was up by a whopping 217% from the year-ago period to $43 million. The good part is that SoundHound AI's growth trajectory has been picking up in recent quarters. The pick-up in the company's growth isn't surprising, considering that it has been quick to build a solid customer base through its product development moves and acquisitions. SoundHound AI's voice AI solutions are used by customers in the automotive, hospitality, restaurant, financial services, retail, and healthcare industries. What's more, it was sitting on a much bigger potential revenue backlog of $1.2 billion at the end of 2024. The fact that it has been growing at an outstanding pace clearly tells us that it has been successfully converting that massive backlog into revenue. That's also the reason why the company has raised its revenue guidance for 2025. Its top line is on track to double this year to $169 million, which is the midpoint of its guidance range. Another thing worth noting is that SoundHound is growing at a faster pace than the 23% annual growth rate of the conversational AI market, which means it's winning a bigger share of this lucrative space that's expected to generate over $79 billion in annual revenue by 2033. As a result, there is a good chance that SoundHound will be able to sustain its remarkable growth rate in the long run and eventually become a much bigger company. That's why investors would do well to buy it following its slide this year. Of course, the stock is expensive right now at 47 times sales, but that seems justified, considering how fast it is growing and its solid prospects. As such, buying SoundHound AI over BigBear.ai seems like the smart thing to do for anyone looking to choose from one of these two AI stocks right now.",Inside The Star-Studded World,2025-10-01T10:06:49Z,https://todayheadline.co/better-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-bigbear-ai-vs-soundhound-ai-todayheadline/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.659514,0.1215686274509804
Town centre opticians set for launderette conversion,"The vacant premises of a town centre opticians could become a new launderette. A planning application has been submitted for the conversion of the property in Duckworth Street, Darwen. The Urban Future Planning Consultancy Ltd has submitted a supporting Planning & Heritage Statement for the proposal to Blackburn with Darwen Council. It says: ""The application site is located within Darwen town centre and has been vacant ever since the opticians ceased operating. ""The applicant seeks to put the vacant commercial unit into active use through the introduction of a laundrette. ""The proposals would create jobs for local people, promote consumer choice, have positive supply-chain effects and create an active frontage whilst generating additional footfall into the town centre. ""The proposal would also generate additional income for the local authority through additional business rates. ""The site falls within the designated Darwen Town Centre Conservation Area. ""Duckworth Street, where the application site is located, has a smaller-scale feel characterised by modest stone-built two-storey buildings with ground-floor shops which predate the railway. ""The site is not identified in the Conservation Area appraisal as being of a positive contribution to the Conservation Area. ""Many retail units along Duckworth Street have been altered with modern shop fronts and new windows. ""In principle, the proposals are acceptable. ""The scheme includes the insertion of roller shutters internally. ""Laundrettes are often targets of crime, given the use of coin-operated machines with money held on-site. ""The applicant considers it paramount to have roller shutters as a form of security. ""Many of the neighbouring commercial units feature external roller shutters. This scheme will internalise the shutters to minimise visibility. ""The proposal represents sustainable economic development which is suitable for a town centre.""",Lancashire Telegraph,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/25506822.darwen-town-centre-opticians-set-launderette-conversion/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.659726,0.2392156862745098
Derelict buildings in Dublin city to be made into homes for gardaí and nurses | BreakingNews,"A three-year roadmap has been unveiled to turn empty and derelict buildings in Dublin city into homes for the likes of gardaí, nurses, and teachers. Middle Abbey Street and North Frederick Street will be part of a pilot that will see property owners given support to regenerate their buildings. Enforcement action will be taken against those who do not engage. Speaking on Newstalk, Richard Guiney from business group Dublin Town said the strategy is welcome. ""I'd like to see some commercial use of the ground floor to maintain the footfall, but I've been in plenty of buildings in Dublin city, the likes of Henry Street etc, where you've got 3,000 or 4,000 square foot of unutilised property that could make quite attractive apartments."" The Irish Times reported that the council's ""bold urban-rejuvenation pilot"" aims to accelerate the provision of cost-rental homes for essential city workers. Both streets in the north inner city have high levels of vacancy and dereliction, and while some buildings are in council ownership, most are privately owned. The council will offer supports and incentives to building owners to bring their properties back into use. However, where it encounters ""non-co-operative owners"", enforcement will be ""prioritised and escalated"" up to compulsory acquisition. The conversion of vacant buildings or unused space above shops into homes for essential workers was one of the 10 ""big moves"" recommended by the Taskforce for Dublin, the €1 billion plan to revitalise the area around O'Connell Street published last October by then taoiseach Simon Harris. Essential workers listed in the report included healthcare, public transport and council workers, as well as gardaí, teachers and retail and hospitality staff, all deemed essential to the operation of the city but could not afford to live there. Speaking on Newstalk, Councillor Cian Farrell said the first phase will see a digital map created of the two streets. ""So we've a really good baseline of what's going on in the street, where can we intervene, what buildings, is it occupied, is it activated to its fullest extent, what condition is it in, what planning history is available and what development potential does it have,"" he said. ""And this is the core of the whole pilot. If we don't have this information, we're kind of throwing darts in the dark.""",Breaking News.ie,2025-10-01T10:08:12Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/derelict-buildings-in-dublin-city-to-be-made-into-homes-for-gardai-and-nurses-1813299.html,2025-10-01 18:30:13.659981,0.2862745098039217
'I'd be amazed if the Chancellor hikes our costs again',"The boss of pub and brewery firm Shepherd Neame says he would be ""astonished"" if Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled any further measures which would hit the hospitality trade's bottom line in her November Budget. The sector is still counting the cost of a hike in employers' National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage - which for the Faversham-based firm cost them £2.6 million, according to its latest financial figures for the last year. That cost, it says, it ""expects to absorb through the 2026 financial year"". But Jonathan Neame, CEO of the company, says he is keeping his fingers crossed the Chancellor does not seek to hammer the pub and restaurant industry again when she finally unveils her Budget on November 26. He is also buoyed by an expected drop in business rates - but does not expect to see any drop in VAT, called for by some in the sector. He told KentOnline: ""I would be astonished if the government decided to go at the sector again on things like National Insurance because the pushback, not just from us, but from all consumer-facing small businesses, has been profound. ""Clearly, the other side of the coin is, 'will these taxes slow consumer demand?' - that is an unknown. ""But I think the industry will continue to lobby, given the fact it is chronically overtaxed and overregulated. I just hope the message has got through."" He says the shift over the last 10 years has made it difficult for all businesses - regardless of the sector. He added: ""I think it's staggering the UK has gone within a decade from being one of the best places in the world to do business to arguably one of the most challenging. ""There are any number of reasons for that, but there are plenty of own goals, which has slowed economic activity and reduced opportunity. All businesses want is certainty. And what businesses will find very difficult to overcome is more and more tax, more and more regulation, and, in the UK's case, what is now a very high labour model and a very high energy model. In terms of global competitiveness, those are unsustainable positions."" Britain's oldest brewery delivered a solid set of financial figures for the year ending June 28 - with a record Christmas, strong trading last summer and a good first six months of 2025. Explains Jonathan Neame: ""We're very pleased with our pub trading. And we're definitely pleased that we continue to do better than others in the sector. ""There's lots of negative narrative about pubs, but what you don't hear so much about is all the pubs that are doing really well. So we're very pleased with that. ""Of course, the big challenge for the sector is cost. We had a very strong first half of the year, which arguably was the first period for some time where there hadn't been a new major cost shock. ""If that had continued to the end of the third quarter, you would have seen a similar, if not better, performance. ""But then in the final quarter, we picked up the packaging tax, we picked up the National Insurance and all the other stuff. ""That is a most unwelcome and new challenge the sector has to face. And it's going to take us 12 months or so to to work our way through that. But we will work our way through it. And as a consequence, we will continue to invest at the same rate for a time when the inflation environment is somewhat more benign."" Revenue for the firm was down 4.6% over the year to £164.3m while underlying operating profit was £13.7m - down 2.2% on the year before. That dip was due to added costs and a decrease in its off-trade sales - such as supermarkets - of its beer brands which continues to see a decline since the sharp spike during the Covid years. It has been further hit due to packaging tax, high-energy bills, and increased glass cost as well as a switch by consumers to more session ales. Concludes the Shepherd Neame boss: ""What have we done about it? We've really invested with great success in terms of building our heartland business, by which we mean selling beer to local customers in the on-trade, local pubs, clubs, cricket clubs, football clubs, whatever it might be. ""We've seen good growth in that area. We're in a transition from off-trade to on-trade, from national to local, from ale to newer brands.""",Kent Online,2025-10-01T10:06:27Z,https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/i-d-be-amazed-if-the-chancellor-hikes-our-costs-again-330548/,2025-10-01 18:30:13.660418,0.03529411764705892

Lake Victoria Gold Ltd.: Building the Starter Pit: Lake Victoria Gold Mobilizes Drill Rig at Imwelo's Area C,"Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Lake Victoria Gold Ltd. (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) (FSE: E1K) (""LVG"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the commencement of a 4,000-metre, multi-purpose drilling campaign at the Area C zone of its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project in northwestern Tanzania. The program is designed to support short-term production readiness, resource expansion and conversion, and final pit design optimization. This campaign forms a key component of LVG's strategy to initiate a low-capex open-pit operation at Imwelo, with future underground development to be evaluated as part of ongoing high-grade exploration and resource growth. Mobilization of the first rig is underway this week, with drilling scheduled to commence October 6, 2025. A second rig has been ordered to accelerate the program and is expected to mobilize in the coming weeks. Strategic Context The Imwelo Project, located just 12 km from AngloGold Ashanti's Geita Gold Mine, is fully permitted under a 10-year mining license. Backed by a simple development plan and metallurgical recoveries >90%, the Company is targeting first gold within 12 months of commencement of construction. Area C is the first zone planned for production and has an average grade of 3.7 g/t Au. It also represents one of the highest-grade zones within the Imwelo historical resource envelope. Previous intercepts include: 2 m @ 5.06 g/t Au from 15 m and 6.8 m @ 14.6 g/t Au from 33.2 m (IMWRC-037)7 m @ 3.22 g/t Au from 27 m (IMRC-014)2 m @ 7.5 g/t Au from 22 m (IMWRC-038) Reported intercepts are down-hole lengths; true widths are unknown. (Source: Measured Group Pty Ltd., Geology and Resource Estimate Report - Imwelo Project, Tanzania, May 2017.) Marc Cernovitch, President & CEO of Lake Victoria Gold, commented: ""By mobilizing now and adding a second rig, we're advancing Imwelo on two fronts-short-term production readiness and resource growth potential. This drill program is designed to tighten mine scheduling, validate pit and slope design, and test down-dip and western extensions at Area C."" Program Highlights Strike extensions. Step-outs to the west will test continuity across the interpreted fault. Geophysics and mapping indicate mineralization may be offset rather than terminated beyond the current pit limits; these holes will assess continuity and potential expansion of the open-pit resource envelope.Depth extensions. Historical drilling at Area C has, on average, tested only to ~45 metres. The planned holes are designed to intersect mineralization at ~100 m and ~200 m down-dip. If mineralization continues at depth as interpreted, results could improve confidence, support potential resource expansion, and help progress the case for future underground targeting of higher-grade zones.Geotechnical work. Select diamond holes will be oriented for structural logging. Data will be used to update geotechnical domains and slope designs for Area C's final pit shells.Metallurgical work. Representative core will be composited for confirmatory testing, with an emphasis on the transition horizon to inform recovery assumptions and early-stage mine scheduling. Seth Dickinson, P.Eng., Chief Operating Officer, added: ""This program is about turning plans into mine-ready decisions-validated pit design and targeted step-outs for potential growth. With two rigs, we expect steady results that support a disciplined transition toward production at Imwelo."" Qualified Person The scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by David Scott, Pr. Sci. Nat., who is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. Scott is a Director and Officer of the Company. Cautionary Note on Production Decision The Company cautions that it has not completed a feasibility study on the Imwelo Project that establishes mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. As a result, there is increased uncertainty and a higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with the Company's production decision. In particular, there is no certainty that the planned low-capex open-pit operation will be economically viable or that planned production will occur as anticipated. Risks include, but are not limited to, variations in grade and recovery, unexpected geotechnical or metallurgical challenges, cost overruns, funding availability, and operational or permitting risks.

New gin launches as a love letter to North Yorkshire market town,"Jago Packer, owner of the Market Weighton Wicstun Distillery, created the Pickering Watercress & Cucumber Gin as something of a love letter to the market town, having been an artisan producer stallholder at the monthly This Little Piggie Market for two years. Having fallen for the town's charms, Jago was keen to create the gin on behalf of the Pickering Town Community Interest Company to help support funding for future community projects. Flavoured with organic watercress from Pickering's historic Willowdene Trout and Watercress Farm, it reflects the town's heritage and character. Recommended reads: The CIC wanted to capture the essence of Pickering and suggested the botanicals could include Willowdene watercress which grows organically on silt beds in pure spring water, still using methods that would have been used when the farm first started back in 1870. The town's community spirit is also bottled thanks to the cucumbers that have been donated by residents from their allotments. The bottle's label, featuring Pickering's market place, has been designed by Richmond artist Richard O'Neill who specialises in contemporary travel art. Beyond the 1940s Weekend, the gin will be on sale at Pickering's October and November markets as well as online https://wicstun-distillery.co.uk/products/pickering-watercress-cucumber-gin with a donation from each of the 70cl bottles, priced £38, supporting the CIC's future projects for the town. Mike Potter, chairman of Pickering Town CIC, said: ""There is a real buzz in the town which is down to the thriving community we're lucky to have, so what better way to celebrate that spirit than with our own gin. ""We're proud to be launching it during a weekend that celebrates the resilience of civilian life during the wartime years; a period that showed perfectly how people could come together and get things done as well as find laughter even during the hardest of times."" The 1940s weekend will see shops, cafés, inns and attractions re-creating the sights and sounds of the period, giving visitors the chance to step back in time as they stroll through Pickering as well as travel by shuttle bus to the nearby authentic World War 2 experience, the Eden Camp where there's a programme of music and dances to enjoy.

The Dry Creek and West Tundra Flat targets together account for an inferred resource of 15.6 Mt at 336 g/t AgEq* for 168.6 million silver equivalent ounces. Drilling at both targets consisted of a series of infill and step-out holes designed to test areas near historical high-grade drill intercepts and modelled domains where the structural controls on high-grade mineralization were not fully resolved. Multiple holes at each target intersected mineralized zones consisting of variable proportions of massive, semi-massive, and disseminated sulfides (Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5). Assays are pending from all holes drilled. Based on observations from drilling together with results from ongoing geological modelling, multiple mineralized lenses and domains at Dry Creek and West Tundra Flats targets remain open along strike and down-dip. The company will integrate all new assay data with the geological modelling to guide vectoring towards additional VMS-related, high-grade mineralization in 2026. Quality Assurance and Quality Control Quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) protocols for drill core sampling at the Red Mountain Project followed industry standard practices. Core samples were typically taken at 1.0 m intervals in mineralized zones, and 3.0 m intervals outside of mineralized zones. Sample lengths were adjusted as necessary so as not to cross lithologic and mineralogic boundaries. QAQC check samples were inserted into the sample stream with one blank, one duplicate (coarse), and one certified reference material (CRM) occurring within every 20 samples. Drill core was cut in half, bagged, sealed and delivered directly to ALS Minerals Fairbanks, Alaska for transport to the ALS Minerals Laboratories labs in North Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS Minerals Laboratories are registered to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 17025 accreditations for laboratory procedures. Core samples were analyzed at ALS Laboratory facilities in North Vancouver using four-acid digestion with an ICP-MS finish. Gold analysis was by fire assay with atomic absorption finish, or gravimetric finish for over-limit samples. Over-limits for silver, zinc, copper, and lead were analyzed using Ore Grade four-acid digestion. The standards, certified reference materials, were acquired from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, British Columbia and selected to represent expected mineralization.

Kilimanjaro climb raises funds for Warrington charity,"A GRUELLING climb to the top of Africa has helped raise funds for a cause close to home. David Parker, managing director of Warrington accountancy firm Purple Accounts, reached the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro and raised more than £1,600 for the dementia charity Speak Up. Mr Parker said: ""It was the toughest thing I've ever done. ""The exhaustion was overwhelming, but seeing the sunrise and finally reaching the summit was beyond words. ""Sharing that moment with my daughters made it even more emotional and unforgettable."" His journey began after hearing a retired RAF fighter pilot speak about her own climb during an entrepreneur conference. Inspired by her story, Mr Parker set his sights on Kilimanjaro and quickly gained two companions -- his daughters, who volunteered to join him. The family spent four months preparing with hikes up to 37km long, including climbs up Snaefell in the Isle of Man and Scafell Pike, England's highest peak. They began their ascent in Tanzania on September 6, trekking through rainforest, alpine desert, and volcanic terrain. After reaching the summit base late on a Friday evening, they set out for the final push at 11pm, climbing through the night across ice and loose scree. The challenge turned into a fundraising effort after Mr Parker was asked if he was climbing for a cause. He chose to support Speak Up, which runs the Warrington Dementia Project, describing dementia as an issue close to his heart. He said: ""So many people are touched by dementia, including my own family. ""I'm delighted that through this challenge we've been able to raise funds to help provide much-needed support for others living with the condition."" Founded in 2007, Purple Accounts is a family-run business that supports entrepreneurs and small business owners in Warrington and across the UK. The firm provides compliance services such as tax, payroll, and bookkeeping, alongside helping clients save time, grow profits, and keep more of what they earn. The funds raised from this adventurous pursuit will provide support for dementia which can provide a lifeline for more families affected by dementia.","Warrington Guardian - news, sport, Wolves, info, cars, jobs and homes in Warrington, Cheshire.",2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/25503494.man-scales-kilimanjaro-warrington-dementia-charity/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.287499,0.2156862745098038
"YOU'RE HIRED, or so you thought. The rise in fake job scams targeting younger Americans","OMAHA, Neb. (KMTV) -- From the emergence of artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty and everything in between, younger Americans are having a harder time finding a job. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds climbed to 10.5 percent in August. It's the highest level in nearly four years and more than twice the national unemployment rate. While looking for jobs younger Americans are having to look out for something else. ""Traditionally, scams go after the elderly population because they're not as tech savvy. This situation is the reverse,"" GuidePoint Security Federal Chief Technology Officer Jean-Paul Bergeaux said. He's talking about fake job scams. According to the Federal Trade Commission, reported losses from job scams tripled between 2020 and 2023 -- and cost Americans more than $220 million dollars in just the first half of 2024. ""They're very prevalent right now and they're growing,"" Bergeaux explained. ""I think a lot of it comes from the virtual work environment we live in. Now that many expect white collar jobs to be remote it allows the bad guys to hide."" He continued, ""They really want to get your personal information. The golden goose for them is to convince you that you have a job and ask for your bank account information, so that they can say they're going to pay you, and then they just take your money."" Bergeaux says there are things to look out for. ""It has to be a job that offers some sort of remote work,"" Bergeaux said. ""If there's a refusal to go into a physical meeting where you can talk to somebody or a live video meeting where you can see and interact with people, those are serious red flags."" Another red flag is if they take your conversation off offical platforms and to platforms like WhatsApp, Snapchat, etc,. Bergeaux says its usually foreigners targeting young Americans in these cases, and the emergence of generative AI has made it more difficult to spot the scam, since it can write the message for the cybercriminals and eliminate language barriers. He also stressed the importance of familiarizing younger Americans on the HR process -- something many have not experienced. If you do fall victim of a scam -- report it to the FBI at ic3.gov. Also, be sure to lock your credit report, bank account and anything that may have been compromised.",KMTV,2025-10-01T10:02:50Z,https://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/youre-hired-or-so-you-thought-the-rise-in-fake-job-scams-targeting-younger-americans,2025-10-01 18:30:20.287967,-0.2470588235294118
Business travel pros reveal baggage survival secrets - Tourism News Africa,"With Europe set to scrap controversial hand-luggage fees by late 2025, and US authorities hinting at an end to the two-decade-old liquids ban, airlines face a luggage revolution on multiple fronts. Sure, business travel has its glossy moments: premium lounges, power suits, and sealing deals over cocktails in a city bar. But increasingly, it's what happens to your suitcase that makes or breaks the trip. And right now, that humble piece of luggage has become ground zero for passenger frustration. 'Luggage rage', that volcanic moment when your bag fails to appear at the carousel, is driving measurable drops in airline satisfaction scores globally. Even when flights run smoothly, a delayed suitcase can torpedo an airline's Net Promoter Score overnight. With global air traffic hitting a record 5.3 billion passengers in 2024, even a small percentage of mishaps translates to millions of frustrated travellers, and airlines are feeling the heat."" Corporate Traveller's business travel experts share their tips (and tales direct from the trenches). Transfers remain the riskiest point in the baggage journey. Whether it's incorrect stickers or a simple loading failure, it's never ideal to arrive at your destination without the bag you carefully packed. Take Kamoelo Mosola, SDR Team Leader at Corporate Traveller South Africa, who flew to Bremen ready for a German winter. His suitcase, however, was rerouted to Miami. ""My sensible wool trousers were apparently enjoying a spontaneous beach holiday while I froze my socks off,"" he recalls. The bag turned up three days later, by which point the story had become funny (albeit inconvenient). Or Nikyle Reddy, Corporate Traveller's Business Development Manager, who discovered his bag had detoured to Turkey instead of Lisbon (thanks to a different sticker attached to the bag). The suave looks he'd packed for the welcoming yacht party? Less ""James Bond"" and more ""Mr Bean"" in a pair of borrowed slacks, but nothing a couple of Aperol Spritz couldn't fix! ""Transfers are where most bags go astray,"" says Herman Heunes, GM of Corporate Traveller South Africa. ""We always advise travellers to remove old stickers, double-check tags and keep essentials in their carry-on, because even rare mishaps can throw off a business trip."" According to SITA's 2025 report, 46% of mishandled bags are delayed at transfer points. International travellers face eleven times the risk compared to domestic flights. How to sidestep the transfer drama: Not all luggage disappears. Some make it to arrivals looking much worse for wear. Around 18% of mishandled bags are damaged, often thanks to conveyor belts, tight connections, or the sheer speed demanded of baggage handlers. Corporate Traveller's Multimedia Designer, Eulalia Richarte, still remembers retrieving her suitcase, patched together with duct tape. As she wheeled it forward, the seams gave way, spilling her belongings across the floor in front of customs while she still held on resolutely to the handle! ""Nothing like having an audience while gathering up your socks,"" she laughs. Bag battles like these aren't just embarrassing. They soak up productive hours, leave your team scrambling, and often end with an unplanned shopping trip. Sometimes a ""delayed bag"" isn't lost at all. It's simply that you've accidentally walked off with a stranger's suitcase because it looked just like yours. This happened to Regional Operations Manager Rategang Moroke, who thought she'd avoided baggage claim blues by buying a distinctive gold suitcase for her Mauritius trip, and yet still accidentally swapped suitcases with a stranger (with excellent taste). ""Even 'unique' bags get mixed up,"" laughs Heunes. ""We tell clients to always check the name tags, no matter how confident they are about their luggage choice."" Funny in hindsight, yes. But lost and damaged luggage can create a real headache for business travellers. Time spent hunting for clothing, buying chargers or toiletries, and rescheduling plans, often while running on little sleep, adds up quickly. ""Business travel margins are tight,"" observes Heunes. ""A delayed bag doesn't just inconvenience the traveller; it can derail entire project timelines and client relationships."" The good news is that change is happening fast. The surge in personal tracking devices tells its own story: Apple AirTags, Samsung Galaxy SmartTags, and Tile trackers are becoming as essential as passports for nervous business travellers. Singapore's Changi Airport now uses AI-powered systems that cut transfer mishandling by over 30%, while Delta credits RFID technology with a 25% drop in lost bags. Meanwhile, regulatory winds are shifting. The EU's decision to eliminate hand-luggage fees will force budget carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet to completely rethink their ancillary revenue models. Across the Atlantic, TSA's hints about ending the 20-year-old liquids ban could make carry-on-only travel far more appealing - no more tiny shampoo bottles or ritual water dumping at security. There's even been a case of a passenger using an AirTag to track down stolen luggage and finding the thief wearing his clothes. Interestingly, as global airline passenger volumes continue to soar, the overall mishandling rate is declining. SITA's latest data shows it dropped to 6.3 bags per 1,000 passengers, meaning you have a 99.37% chance your bag will arrive safely. ""The industry is getting better, but business travellers can't afford to be the unlucky 0.63%,"" says Heunes. ""Smart preparation and choosing the right partners makes all the difference.""",Tourism News Africa,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://tourismnewsafrica.com/business-travel-pros-reveal-baggage-survival/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.289197,-0.2235294117647059
"Stocks mixed, gold hits record as US government shuts down","With no clear path out of the impasse over a funding deal, agencies warned the government shutdown would halt the release of a closely watched September employment report and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400m. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures dropped about 0.6% each on Wednesday. Gold prices climbed to $3,895 an ounce, hitting a record high for a third straight session. European shares were mostly higher, with the pan-continental STOXX 600 up 0.4%. Britain's FTSE 100 and Switzerland's SMI outperformed, boosted by healthcare stocks which jumped on expectations they could avoid excessive US import tariffs after President Donald Trump struck a deal with Pfizer on prescription drug prices. With Friday's nonfarm payrolls report expected to be absent, investors may place greater weight on the ADP National Employment Report due later today. Forecasts are centred on a modest gain of 50,000 private-sector jobs. ""The shutdown ought not to have any major effect on markets,"" said Lars Skovgaard, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank. ""I wouldn't rule out that it can add some jitters but you shouldn't be worried about it. We're not,"" Skovgaard added. Futures now imply a 95% chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in October, up from 90% from a day earlier, with around a 75% probability of another move in December. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said in a note that if the shutdown lingers, September inflation reports in mid-October could also be negatively affected. ""An extended period where the US Bureau of Labor Statistics is not operating at full strength could affect data-collection efforts for other reports, which may impact the quality of the data,"" he said. On Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.9%, after an 11% surge the previous quarter. South Korean shares rose 0.9%, adding to the 11.5% gain in the last quarter, after data showed its exports rose at the fastest pace in 14 months in September. Taiwan's shares gained 0.6%. The island's top tariff negotiator said on Wednesday that Taiwan will not agree to a deal with Washington for half of all semiconductor production to take place in the US. Chinese markets, including Hong Kong, were closed for a public holiday. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar index slipped for a fourth straight day and was last down 0.2% to 97.59. The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1756, while sterling was up 0.2% at $1.3474. The dollar was off 0.6% at 147.06 yen, after a Bank of Japan survey showed confidence among big Japanese manufacturers improved for a second quarter, heightening the chance of an interest-rate hike as soon as this month. In the Treasuries market, yields were steady in European morning trade. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield was flat at 4.156%, having risen 1 basis point the day before. Oil prices were steady after two consecutive days of losses as investors weighed potential OPEC+ plans for a larger output hike next month against the prospect of shrinking inventories in the US.

Q & A: What CT residents should know about their money and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed into law, a major spending and tax-cutting package called H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The bill has been praised by some and criticized by others. We talked with Heath Grossman, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and partner with Johnson Brunetti, the Wethersfield-based retirement planning and investment firm, to ask him his thoughts on what this new law could mean to real people. What do you see as the major components of One Big Beautiful Bill that people most need to know about? The One Big Beautiful Bill introduces far-reaching changes in taxes, social spending, defense and energy policy. It makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, keeping lower individual and estate tax rates in place while expanding deductions for small businesses. For workers and families, taxes will stay low. Some workers whose compensation includes tips, and overtime can see some of that income being tax free. The bill also raises or alters the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a key issue for residents of high-tax states. Conversely, as tax cuts must be paid for, this bill reduces funding for social safety net programs -- one major example is Medicaid, which faces new work requirements, stricter eligibility verification and reduced state support. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill will significantly raise the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion over 10 years and could cause millions to lose health coverage. Who will tend to benefit from it? Who could be adversely impacted, at least financially? In a general sense, most everyone should benefit tax-wise from this bill to varying degrees; the tax cuts are broad ranging. By making the previous 2017 tax cut permanent, the standard deduction will remain at high levels and tax rates will remain at reduced levels. What's more, the additional deduction of $6,000 per person for those 65 and over can be a positive. This additional deduction is not permanent, though. In terms of potential adverse impacts, people who rely on Medicaid or SNAP benefits could be impacted, as SNAP benefits would also be cut back by shifting costs to states and enforcing additional work obligations and administrative burdens. What are you advising clients right now who come to you with concerns about this new law? At the outset, we are advising clients to update their withholding to minimize potential tax overpayments. This also adds importance to people considering Roth IRA conversions, especially for folks that are 65 and over. For those who are concerned it could have a negative impact on them, should they alter their long-range planning, stick with their current plan, or is it a hybrid of the two? This is a very common question and a good one. And the answer really comes down to people should stick with the plan they have already set for themselves -- trust the plan, trust themselves. Could there be a reason to make some alterations depending on what the market is doing as a result of this bill? Of course, there always are. But the worst thing people can do at a time like this is panic. If there is a plan for retirement in place, stick with it and make adjustments as needed. If they have no plan as of yet, this is an ideal time to put one together. Some economists have said the cuts in this bill, coupled with the uncertainty created by the administration's changing plans for tariffs on imported goods and supplies, could create a level of chaos that may not be financially healthy. Do you agree, and if so, what could the impact be? People are always wise to detach their politics from their overall investment strategy -- a strategy like that is designed to last for decades, and with politics, obviously, positions and policies can change every few years, if not from year to year. The bill as signed into law certainly has generated its share of discussion and concern in many sectors, but that only turns to chaos when people start reacting rashly and emotionally. If they remove emotion from the equation, they will be much better off in letting their investments work for them. Finally, looking ahead, what are the key steps individuals and families should take now to prepare themselves -- financially and mentally -- for the changes One Big Beautiful Bill could bring? Looking ahead, individuals and families can take several practical steps to prepare for the possible impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill. First, it is important to review household budgets with an eye toward flexibility; changes to tax deductions, credits and benefits could either increase or reduce take-home income, so families should understand where their money goes and know where they can tighten spending if need be. Building or reinforcing an emergency savings fund is also wise, especially if healthcare or food assistance costs rise due to new eligibility rules or work requirements -- having the equivalent of a few months of salary in savings is a good rule of thumb. On the positive side, families who may benefit from extended tax cuts should consider how to use that relief strategically; this could be done by paying down debt, investing in education or saving for retirement, to name just three good examples. But mental preparedness matters too. Policy shifts often bring uncertainty and understanding that adjustments may be required can reduce stress, so people should stay engaged, ask questions of employers and use this to make better informed decisions.",Hartfort Courant,2025-09-30T10:28:28Z,https://www.courant.com/2025/10/01/q-a-what-ct-residents-should-know-about-their-money-and-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.290714,0.2392156862745098

Speaking on the increases, leading broker of Health Insurance Ireland, Dermot Goode, said customers should never rely on the average figures quoted above. ""In many cases, the actual increase will well exceed these average figures. More importantly, consumers are forgetting there there were other increases earlier in the year, which are also coming their way.""

You've got less than 5 years to rescue your money from AI and stablecoins. Here's what to do.,"Previous Fourth Turnings had the decency to unfold over decades. This one's happening at internet-fueled hyperspeed. The CEO of Anthropic -- a company that makes artificial brains smarter than actual brains -- said half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could vanish in one to five years. This is like the guy who invented the guillotine telling you he's made some really exciting efficiency improvements. By 2030, every baby boomer will be of retirement age and expecting the government to keep its promises, which is adorable in the way that believing in Santa Claus is adorable -- except Santa Claus doesn't owe $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Medicare needs $78 trillion. Social Security needs $23 trillion. State pensions need miracles. We were planning to pay for this by taxing workers, except -- surprise -- the robots are taking those jobs. It's like planning to pay your mortgage by winning the lottery, except you forgot to buy a ticket and the lottery has been discontinued. History shows us three ways out: inflation, default or war. Being American, we're going for the triple crown. But digitally, because we're modern. Some smart people saw this coming. Bitcoin BTCUSD went from drug-dealer currency to a $2 trillion asset class. Gold GC00 has been quietly beating stocks. Everyone's trying to get their money out of dollars and into something the government can't print more of. But here's where it gets beautiful, in the way a mushroom cloud is beautiful from a distance. Washington just blocked the escape route. Stablecoins move $190 billion daily -- more than Visa V and Mastercard MA combined. The biggest stablecoin issuer, Tether, USDTUSD owns $127 billion in Treasury bonds, making it a bigger lender to Uncle Sam than most countries. But stablecoins are terrible investments. They're designed to be worth exactly one dollar forever, earning nothing. The real play is owning companies like Circle CRCL that collect fees on every transaction. Think toll roads, not cars. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants to channel $3.7 trillion through stablecoins into Treasurys over the next decade. That's not monetary policy; it's monetary conscription. The world's central banks know this game is ending. China is hoarding gold. Europe is building independent payment systems. They see what's coming: a monetary reset where the dollar's exorbitant privilege ends, not through Chinese conquest but through American fiscal exhaustion, accelerated by AI destroying the tax base. When the only financial world you've ever known is ending, you want to own things that don't require faith in government competence. Fourth Turnings are brutal for conventional investment portfolios. But Fourth Turnings also create generational wealth for those who recognize the opportunities. Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie built their fortunes in the chaos of the 1860s-1870s. Families who bought U.S. stocks in 1932 or real estate in 1945 created dynasties. Today's opportunity lies in assets governments can't debase or confiscate digitally -- yet. Real assets that generate income even when money's worthless. The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, because someone has to own the robots replacing us. Gold and silver SI00, which have outlasted every empire that thought it was different. Bitcoin -- digital gold that, unlike stablecoins, can't be forced to buy Treasury bonds at gunpoint. Fourth Turnings resolve the same way my New Year's resolutions do: Complete abandonment of previous promises and a system nobody saw coming. Here's what actually happens: whoever has the guns and the goods makes the new money rules. The Civil War? The Union had more guns and factories, so state currencies died and greenbacks were born. World War II? The U.S. had all the gold, half the world's production, and the only unbombed factories, so the U.S. at Bretton Woods made everyone accept dollars as the new gold. Then, when that got inconvenient, Nixon canceled that deal faster than a streaming service subscription. Today America's got a problem. It has the guns but not the goods. China makes everything from your iPhone to your underwear. The U.S. owes money that would make a drunken sailor blush. And the only thing growing faster than U.S. debt is AI eating jobs like Pac-Man eating dots. These awkward facts force three changes: First, a new monetary system where the dollar shares top billing with a basket of currencies and commodities. It's like being demoted from CEO to co-CEO, except your co-CEO owns the factory and you owe him money. Second, stablecoins become the new financial repression. It's the same scam we pulled after World War II, forcing people to hold bonds paying less than inflation -- except now it's global and digital. Tether just announced a special U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin called USA₮. Every digital-dollar USA₮ transaction is a mandatory loan to Uncle Sam -- at whatever rate he feels like paying. Third, the imposition of wealth taxes -- because when you can't tax paychecks that don't exist, you tax the house, the 401k and that boat you're living on because you sold your house. Politicians who swore on their mother's grave never to touch retirement accounts will explain that mom would want you to be patriotic. Five years before this Fourth Turning becomes whatever comes next. In that time, expect the Fed to lose independence faster than a college freshman with a credit card. The dollar will lose its monopoly like Standard Oil, except that it will make everyone poorer. AI will eliminate jobs while stablecoins conscript savings. Your portfolio should be positioned like you're planning for a hurricane, an earthquake, and a plague of locusts, because financially speaking, that's the combo platter we ordered. Own things that survive regime changes. Avoid anything that can be ""repurposed"" for the greater good. And remember: In times like these, the return OF your capital beats return ON your capital like rock beats scissors. When the world's largest asset manager and the 'bond king' both agree -- run to gold, silver and bitcoin AI will take your job in the next 18 months. Here's your survival guide. And now for Washington's next trick -- sawing the dollar's value in half",Yahoo!

Hanza completes acquisition of Milectria,"Sweden EMS provider Hanza has completed the acquisition of Milectria, a contract manufacturer of electrical systems for the defence industry. The acquisition is described as an important step in Hanza's LYNX program and strengthens the group's capacity and geographical presence. Hanza's launched its LYNX program earlier this year with the aim of accelerating growth in the defence and security industry, while also securing capacity for other customer segments. The acquisition of Milectria creates a dedicated platform to meet volume increases in these areas. Milectria has approximately 300 employees and operations in Finland, Estonia, and Abu Dhabi. The deal adds four new production units with highly specialised expertise that strengthen and complement Hanza. A business unit with proprietary products has been excluded from the deal and will be retained by the sellers. As these products have been manufactured in Milectria's factories and will now be relocated, significant capacity will be freed up for contract manufacturing. The purchase price amounts to EUR 17.1 million, corresponding to approximately SEK 190 million. At the time of acquisition, Milectria had a turnover of just over EUR 30 million. An additional purchase price of up to EUR 18 million may be payable, based on sales growth during the period 2025-2027, which assumes that Milectria will more than double its sales during this period.",Evertiq,2025-10-01T10:07:48Z,https://evertiq.com/news/2025-10-01-hanza-completes-acquisition-of-milectria,2025-10-01 18:30:20.294079,0.2627450980392156

You must exit your car and hand over your papers, but say nothing. I suggest you say, ""I invoke my 4th, 5th, 6th and 14th amendment rights and choose to remain silent."" Then exercise that right. We don't want you driving if you are intoxicated. However, if police are going to jail you, it must be legal. The field sobriety test, in my opinion, is purposely designed to be a subjective collection of evidence to use against you, not help you. We are not required to perform the test.

Kenya in China talks as US partnership hangs in balance,"Kenya has launched high-level negotiations with China aimed at recalibrating its trade strategy, as the country faces mounting uncertainty over its partnership with the United States and the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Foreign Affairs and Diaspora Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi confirmed a Kenyan delegation is in China under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation framework to push for a preferential trade deal that could expand market access for Kenyan exports. ""This is critical for us, critical for Africa, bearing in mind the volatility we are seeing in the global trading arena,"" Mudavadi said on Monday during a reception that marked the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China at the Chinese embassy in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. For two decades, AGOA has provided duty-free access for Kenyan exports, particularly textiles and apparel, to the US. However, exporters are facing an uncertain future as the pact was set to expire on Tuesday, with Washington offering little clarity on its renewal. The recent imposition of 10 percent tariffs on some Kenyan goods has heightened pressure on government to diversify trade partnerships. Mudavadi has termed China's preferential trade policy with African countries as a turning point and an opportunity for countries on the continent to move away from aid dependency towards sustainable, reciprocal trade, while strengthening regional integration through the African Continental Free Trade Area. He encouraged other African countries to take advantage of the timely policy in order to realize a predictable, reliable and consistent trade arrangement. ""It is upon us, both individually and collectively, to take more seriously any opportunities of consolidating trade arrangements with our developing partners,"" Mudavadi said. China's Ambassador to Kenya Guo Haiyan hailed the East African country as a trusted partner of Beijing and reaffirmed China's commitment to strengthening cooperation. Guo pointed to Beijing's decision to expand zero-tariff treatment for African nations, including Kenya, as a demonstration of China's long-term commitment to shared prosperity.",China Daily,2025-10-01T10:07:30Z,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202510/01/WS68dcfc37a310f735438b3490.html,2025-10-01 18:30:20.294659,0.1607843137254903
"China, Tanzania and Zambia seal deal to revitalize TAZARA railway","China, Tanzania and Zambia have signed agreements to revitalize the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), one of Africa's landmark transport corridors. The project, valued at an approximate total of $1.4 billion, is the result of more than 18 months of negotiations. The project will include an initial $1.1 billion investment, to be followed by $238 million in additional investment. The China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), which originally built TAZARA between 1970 and 1976, will spearhead the revitalization. According to a statement released on Tuesday, the work will include refurbishment of the track from Dar es Salaam to New Kapiri Mposhi, an upgrade to major workshops, maintenance of the existing line, and the purchase of 34 new locomotives, 16 passenger coaches and 760 wagons. At Monday's signing ceremony in Beijing, Frank Tayali, Zambia's minister of transport and logistics, said the revitalization was ""not just about restoring a railway line but reigniting a vision of regional integration, economic growth and shared prosperity"". Tayali added that the project would provide farmers, traders and industry with a critical link to markets across the region while creating new opportunities for young people. Makame Mbarawa, Tanzania's minister of transport, emphasized the project's potential to stimulate economic growth and employment in both his own country and Zambia. CRCC Chairman Dai Hegen said the company's track record in Africa, including the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway and the TAZARA Memorial Park, are evidence of its long-standing partnership with the continent. The TAZARA railway, often referred to as the ""Uhuru Railway"", was first constructed with Chinese support as a symbol of solidarity and cooperation.",China Daily,2025-10-01T10:07:30Z,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202510/01/WS68dcfb50a310f735438b348b.html,2025-10-01 18:30:20.294925,0.2862745098039217
Letter: Review insurance laws after HMSA court ruling | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . Mahalo nui loa to Dr. Frederick Nitta, his legal team and the justices of the Hawaii Supreme Court for a decision that should improve access to health care. Dr. Nitta, speaking truth to authority, successfully challenged and exposed the process of delaying and denying health care coverage by HMSA. Hopefully, this decision will encourage the state Insurance Commission, with assistance from the attorney general, to review the unconscionability of prior authorization requirements for all health care insurance companies, thus protecting patients' and providers' rights. Perhaps, in a process like the Insurance Commission's rate oversight for health care insurance, the commission could streamline or eliminate unnecessary prior authorizations.

Capitan Silver Corp.: Capitan Silver Identifies New High-Priority Targets at Cruz De Plata and Provides Property Update,"Highlights: Mineralized system at the Cruz de Plata (""CDP"") project is significantly larger than previously outlined.Cumulative silver-mineralized vein structures have grown to more than 20km from 7km (previously announced on May 24, 2023). These structures have been identified from surface sampling and mapping on the newly consolidated land package. A large granodiorite intrusion identified to the north of the main Jésus María trend is a key feature for locating mineralization at Cruz de Plata, with the main silver trend now found to wrap around the intrusion on its western and northern contact within the folded sedimentary package. All known lithologies at the CDP project contain precious and base metal mineralization.Six (6) new priority targets identified and being advanced to the drill-ready stage.Property-wide geophysical survey commissioned and should be completed by Q1 2026.Assays pending for 38 reverse-circulation (""RC"") drill holes with additional holes being drilled every week.Fully Funded Phase 1 Drill Program expanded by 50% to 15,000m. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 1, 2025) - Capitan Silver Corp. (TSXV: CAPT) (""Capitan"" or ""the Company"") is pleased to provide an update for its Cruz de Plata silver-gold project, located in Durango, Mexico. The Company reported today that a surface exploration campaign on the newly acquired 2,171-hectare strategic land package (See Company press release dated August 22, 2025) has identified several new high-priority targets and high-grade mineral showings that include significant extensions to known mineral structures, which the Company is now advancing to the drill-ready stage. These discoveries are significant as they validate management's thesis that the hydrothermal system at Cruz de Plata is much larger than what was previously known, with the mineral footprint and structures now shown to extend several kilometres to the north of the current limits of the 2025 drill program. A key takeaway is that mineralization is observed to be hosted within all known geological units identified at Cruz de Plata, further increasing the potential for new targets, and increasing the potential of the property. Alberto Orozco, CEO of Capitan Silver, commented: ""The continued growth and evolution of Cruz de Plata has been tremendously exciting for the Company. What began as a handful of isolated silver targets has expanded into a much larger mineralized system. The new detailed geological map and surface sampling highlights how robust the Cruz de Plata system can be, while immediately giving us multiple new targets to aggressively move to a drill-ready stage. We would also like to announce that we are upsizing our Phase One Drill Program by 50%, for a total of 15,000 metres, which is fully funded. Mr. Orozco continued, ""the airborne geophysical survey that the Company has commissioned, will be the first property-wide initiative for target generation and expansion by covering the entire project area with new and detailed geophysical data."" Property Consolidation Summary The Company's original (2020) property package contained two isolated high-grade silver vein targets, Jésus María and San Rafael, as well as the disseminated gold target (Capitan Hill) to the south of the Jésus María showings. In 2022, Capitan completed its first property acquisition at Cruz de Plata, growing the property by 261.42 hectares and connecting the Jésus María and San Rafael targets, which formed the Jésus María silver trend (See Company press release dated December 6, 2022). On August 22, 2025, the Company announced the acquisition of a key property covering a total surface of 2,171.4 hectares, completing the consolidation of the Cruz de Plata property package (See Figure 1). Prior to the latest acquisition, the Company conducted a detailed mapping and surface sampling program that, together with the newly acquired data from the previous operator, has formed the basis of a new understanding of the controls of the mineral system and the discovery of multiple new targets. Figure 1 below shows the starting and current land position for the Cruz de Plata project. Figure 1: Capitan Silver's original land position in 2020 for the Cruz de Plata silver-gold project is shown in green with the strategic acquisitions in 2022 and 2025 shown in pink and blue respectively.

Exploration crews systematically followed this contact with further mapping and sampling to evaluate the possibility of the silver mineralization continuing along the entire contact of the granodiorite intrusive and the sediments. Results of this survey, which also included compilation data from previous operators, validated this hypothesis (See Figure 2).

To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7373/268684_5292b213f48e7878_003full.jpg The current geological thesis suggests that the genesis of the hydrothermal mineralization at Cruz de Plata occurs somewhere below the granodiorite, with the documented radial fractures in the intrusive unit being the main conduit transporting the mineralization across the property. As the mineralized fluids reach the sediment rock package, they form the silver vein trend in a combination of replacement zones and hydrothermal breccias. As mineralized fluids continue to flow further away from the source along these radial fractures and cross the boundary of the Tertiary volcanic unit, this is where the Company believes the gold mineralization is deposited (in the cooler temperature part of the mineralized system - Capitan Hill). This potentially explains the relationship of the Gully Fault (believed to be one of several key radial fractures) to both the Jésus María silver vein trend and the Capitan Hill gold deposit. Recent Surface Exploration and New Discoveries Capitan's exploration team conducted a reconnaissance-scale surface evaluation of the newly acquired land package consisting of mapping, surface trenching and soil sampling, with the objective of identifying new targets. Early field work provided further evidence of structural and lithological controls for silver and gold mineralization; mainly the silver system emplacing around and proximal to the contact with an intrusive granodiorite body (Figure 2). In addition to identifying high-grade silver mineralization around the granodiorite intrusive, the Company has identified the potential for the silver zone to grow via radial structures cross-cutting the granodiorite intrusion. Strong silver and gold grades have been returned from prospecting and are described below. Additionally, the Company has defined the lithological contact between the folded sedimentary package and the overlying, younger volcanic rock package across the easternmost portion of the property package. This environment is prospective for additional disseminated gold mineralization, similar to what is found at Capitan Hill. Prior to the commencement of the surface program, Capitan commissioned a new high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (""DTM"") and satellite image from Pacific Geomatics of Vancouver, BC to help field crews identify old historic workings and areas of potential outcrop. This provided field crews with a more efficient method of evaluating the property and led to a reduction in the time spent seeking these new targets. This program, still in its early stages, has resulted in the discovery of at least six (6) new mineral showings, including significant extensions to known mineralized structures across the newly acquired land package, which are described below (Figure 3).

To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7373/268684_5292b213f48e7878_004full.jpg Description of Targets Casco Norte (High-grade Gold and Silver) - NEW Casco Norte is located in the central portion of the newly consolidated property package (See Figures 2 & 3) and consists of a series of workings and pits that trend roughly west-northwest, and has been traced along strike for 150m. Mineralization consists of sheared and brecciated, strongly silicified granitic to granodioritic intrusive that is at least 3-4m in width. A series of grab and chip samples were taken across the old workings, which returned moderate to high-grade Au values, ranging from trace to the best value returning 4,291.2 g/t AgEq (See Table 1). Despite the low topographic relief of the area, overburden depth is surprisingly thin, which will allow for further surface exploration work, including mechanical trenching. Follow-up work will begin on this target in the next several weeks. Jésus María Northwest - NEW Jésus María Northwest is located along the north contact of the sediment-granitic intrusive boundary, approximately 400-500m northwest of the western most drillholes of the main Jésus María silver zone. The showing consists of an old mine working in an area of low topographic relief, with little outcrop, that trends roughly north-northwest. Capitan geologists were able to enter the old workings and obtain a sample for analysis and have confirmed that mineralization closely resembles the main Jésus María zone. This discovery is significant as it extends the Jésus María zone approximately 800m to the west and north, suggesting it wraps around the main granodioritic intrusive body. Sampling from the main showing returned significant values ranging from trace to high-grade values with the best value returning 2,268.1 g/t AgEq (See Table 1). Follow-up work will continue in this area and will include soil geochemistry, possible mechanical trenching, and geophysics. Jésus María East - NEW The extension of the Jésus María silver trend to the east hosts the historic San Rafael mine and has seen small amounts of drilling by Capitan in 2022. Capitan geologists have traced similar style mineralization onto the newly consolidated land package, adding approximately 1.2km of strike to this zone. A series of grab and chip samples have been taken along this zone, with analysis returning values ranging from trace to high-grade mineralization with the best value returning 1,337.5 g/t AgEq. Additional surface work in this area will include mapping and mechanical trenching to upgrade this target to the drill-ready stage. San Rafael West - NEW The San Rafael West zone is the northernmost of the veins and structures that are part of the east-west trending Jésus María silver trend. This zone is located just to the north and west of the El Casco Property boundary, approximately 500m to the north of the Jésus María showings (See Figures 2 & 3). High-grade silver mineralization has been traced over a strike length of approximately 150m with grab and chip samples ranging from trace to high-grade with the best value of 1,379.1 g/t AgEq being returned (See Table 1). Mineralization is hosted in hornfelsed sediments, very proximal to the sedimentary granite intrusive boundary. This target remains open along strike to the east-and west. La Providencia La Providencia consists of a series of pits and shallow workings that trend northwest and can be traced along strike for approximately 400m. Mineralization is hosted in sheared and brecciated granodioritic intrusive and dips steeply to the southwest. Capitan geologists have taken a series of chip and grab samples within the workings and along the surface expression of the veins at higher elevations. The best values returned include 381.6 g/t AgEq. Additional surface work, including mechanical trenching, will be conducted at this target to upgrade it to drill-ready stage. La Purisima - NEW The La Purisima showing is located within the northeastern portion of the Capitan claim group, approximately 4.5km northeast of the main Jésus María trend (See Figures 2 & 3). This portion of the mining claim group was - until recently - quite isolated, with little incentive to explore further due to the very small size of the surrounding mining claim (approximately 200m north-south in dimension). The recent property consolidation has changed these circumstances significantly with the infilling of the property to the south. As a result, field crews were sent to evaluate this area further. La Purisima occurs at the northern contact between the granodioritic intrusive and limestone sediments, with mineralization resembling more of a skarn-like appearance, from the limited exposure observed at this time. The showing consists of a series of old pits and shafts that occur in an area of very low topographic relief, over a strike length of approximately 50m. Grab and chip samples from this area returned polymetallic Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn, with values ranging from trace to 241.6 g/t AgEq. Follow-up work will continue, in this area with additional prospecting, and possible mechanical trenching. Jésus María North - NEW This target consists of east-northeast and northwest striking structures that have been mapped and sampled in the sedimentary unit, along the north contact of the intrusive. Outcrop in this area is minimal, so future exploration targeting will rely on expanding the soil geochemistry program and airborne geophysics. El Tubo Hill Gold The El Tubo Hill contains a very similar stratigraphy to the Capitan Hill oxide gold deposit where Tertiary volcanics rest unconformably over the deformed sedimentary unit. At Capitan Hill, the contact between the two units is marked by the Capitan vein, with mineralization then expanding from that point both underneath into the sediments and above towards the volcanics, forming a large volume of gold mineralization. At El Tubo, low-grade gold mineralization has been identified in outcrop, along the contact between the two units. Additionally, soil geochemical sampling returned anomalous values over a strike length of approximately 500m. Expanded 2025 Drilling Program The Company is pleased to report that it will be upsizing its 2025 Phase One Drilling Program from 10,000m to 15,000m. Capitan has completed just over 8,000m of drilling to date, with assays pending for 38 drill holes. With new drill holes being delivered to the lab weekly, the Company will continue to update the market as assay results are received. Airborne Geophysical Program Capitan is pleased to report that it has engaged the services of Expert Geophysics Services of Newmarket, Ontario, to complete a property-wide 385 line-km regional airborne magnetic and magneto-telluric survey. The results generated from this survey will include magnetic maps and their various derivatives, as well as apparent conductivity and resistivity maps that can be used to help identify new alteration zones, geological features and lithologies, and extensions of existing zones (including fault structures), up to depths of 1km.

International Coffee Day: The world's favorite ritual - ProtoThema English,"From Italian espresso to Greek frappé and Vietnamese iced coffee, the world celebrates a timeless ritual that connects cultures through a single cup Coffee is much more than a hot drink. For millions of people, it's both a daily necessity and a daily pleasure, while for many cultures it stands as a symbol of tradition. From Brazil to Côte d'Ivoire, and from Europe to Asia, every place has its own ""sacred"" way of enjoying it. Somewhere between aromas, brewing secrets, and small rituals, a universal language is born -- one spoken without words: the language of coffee. In the East, coffee is a matter of patience: brewed slowly in hot sand or in a cezve, giving the beans time to release their full aroma. In Italy, where life moves at a dizzying pace, the espresso provides a quick but powerful burst of energy. In Greece, Greek coffee -- with its signature kaimaki foam -- is a point of reference, though its ""authorship"" is shared with the Turkish tradition. One thing is certain: good coffee begins with a good blend. Soil, climate, water, and air shape the character of each bean. The two main varieties, Arabica and Robusta, branch into countless shades, with Brazil, Jamaica, Vietnam, and Tanzania among the world's top sources. But in the end, the ""perfect coffee"" is always the one that best suits our own habits. Espresso Romano In Italy, coffee culture has strict rules. Ristretto is the ultimate obsession, while ordering a cappuccino after a meal is considered nearly sacrilegious. In the north, strong coffee is preferred; in the south, lighter. Naples proudly boasts the best espresso bars. Among the more unusual variations is the Espresso Romano, served with a twist of lemon peel -- though its actual connection to Rome remains questionable. Americano Despite its name, the Americano was born in Italy, when U.S. soldiers during World War II diluted espresso with hot water. In the U.S., though, the favorites are different: the Gibraltar (similar to a macchiato) and the Red Eye (espresso combined with drip coffee). The average American drinks 3.5 cups per day, with Seattle still reigning as the country's coffee capital. Mediterranean and Exotic Flavors In Spain, mezcla coffee is distinguished by its caramelized taste, as the beans are roasted with sugar. In Portugal, mazagran is served cold with lemon and ice, while in Germany the Pharisaer mixes coffee with rum and whipped cream. In Vietnam, coffee is made with condensed milk and ice, while in Greece, the frappé has become the ultimate summer drink. Coffee brewed in the cezve (or briki) traveled from Yemen and Cairo to Constantinople and Athens. For Turks, it is part of their cultural heritage; for Greeks, a daily ritual. Tradition dictates that the coffee should simmer slowly in hot sand or ash to create the perfect foam. Some prefer it strong and thick (meraklidikos), others lighter -- but all agree it is a custom with deep roots.",protothemanews.com,2025-10-01T10:07:38Z,https://en.protothema.gr/2025/10/01/international-coffee-day-the-worlds-favorite-ritual/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.299027,0.411764705882353
"Lifeway to shake-up board after Danone ""co-operation"" deal","Lifeway Foods can ""move forward with clarity and stability"", the kefir maker's CEO has said, after the company struck a ""co-operation"" deal with minority shareholder Danone. The relationship between Lifeway and Danone - which invested in the business in 1999 - has become strained over the last 12 months after the US group rejected two takeover bids from the French giant and the companies embarked on litigation against each other. This summer, ""representatives"" of Danone and Lifeway started talks to ""reset"" the relationship and hold discussions over a ""potential acquisition"". However, last month, Danone said it would not table another offer and would weigh up whether to sell its 22.7% stake. The Activia maker said it would also ponder whether to support a move by the Lifeway's largest shareholder to replace the company's board. But, in a statement issued yesterday (30 September), Lifeway announced a multi-faceted agreement with Danone. The deal will see Lifeway ""refresh"" its board by appointing four new directors. By the end of the month, the company will also separate the roles of chair and CEO, which have been held by Ms. Smolyansky. The businesses have also agreed to ""stay"" the litigation between them. ""Lifeway has always been about resilience, innovation and community. This agreement allows us to move forward with clarity and stability, while continuing to focus on what matters most: bringing probiotic-rich foods to more families and creating value for our shareholders,"" Ms. Smolyansky, currently Lifeway's chair, president and CEO, said. ""We are pleased to have this agreement in place as we enter this next chapter of growth."" The litigation between the companies had centred on a shareholder agreement that Danone said Lifeway had breached with a share award to Ms. Smolyansky earlier this year. Lifeway said the shareholder agreement violated state law in Illinois, where the company is based. As well as halting the litigation, the new co-operation deal between the two companies will see Lifeway agree to comply with the shareholder agreement that had been the source of the tension. Danone has agreed to waive certain rights, including its right to appoint a member of the Lifeway board. The Actimel owner has also said it would not support the move to replace by Lifeway's board if it is put forward before the end of June next year. In July, Ludmila and Edward Smolyansky, the mother and brother of Julie, who are the company's largest shareholders, submitted a ""definitive consent statement"" to the SEC, seeking to replace Lifeway's board, including Julie, with nominees ""focused on restoring accountability, transparency and long-term shareholder value"". The move was the latest salvo in a long-running family dispute that has seen Ludmila and Edward publicly criticise how Julie was running the company. Under the terms of Lifeway's new deal with Danone, the three new candidates to join the US group's board will be independent directors and ""unaffiliated with Danone, Edward and Ludmila Smolyansky, Lifeway, or any current Lifeway officer or director"". Director Pol Sikar will leave the board by Lifeway's 2025 annual meeting. Jay Scher and one additional director will step down by the company's 2026 annual meeting. Just Food has asked Danone for comment and approached representatives for Ludmila and Edward Smolyansky for a reaction to the agreement.",just-food.com,2025-10-01T10:07:35Z,https://www.just-food.com/news/danone-lifeway-deal/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.299507,0.07450980392156858
Letter: Aloha spirit on display at canceled Swims concert | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . I was at the scheduled Teddy Swims concert on Friday. After an excellent opening act by Seven Suns, Teddy came out and sang a couple of songs. It was obvious that he was not well. He was struggling to sing, clutching his neck, and looking red-faced. I was so proud of the crowd when it was announced that the concert was canceled because he wasn't well. There were some groans, which was understandable, but I didn't hear any boos or jeers from the crowd. Everyone was so gracious, kind and understanding despite the disappointment.

Letter: Dems had reason to buck Kirk resolution | Honolulu Star-Advertiser,"Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser r? Log in now to . A recent letter writer questioned U.S. House Democrats' votes on House Resolution 719 honoring Charlie Kirk (""Dems show poor form in vote on Kirk resolution,"" Star-Advertiser, Sept. 25). Did he actually compare that resolution with June's bicameral H.R. 519 condemning an attack on Minnesota state legislators, or even Senate Resolution 391 condemning Kirk's assassination? If so, it should be obvious that House Republicans were, as Jimmy Kimmel noted, trying to score political points. The resolution honoring Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman has two very short clauses praising her public service. The one for Kirk has 10, some extolling him not only for ""exercising his God-given right to speak freely"" (how ironic), but also for ""always seeking to elevate truth, (and) foster understanding."" S.R. 391 was much more along the lines of H.R. 519, and was passed unanimously. Not that I expect the letter writer to be convinced that these are good reasons for House Democrats' voting ""present."" The Honolulu Star-Advertiser welcomes all opinions.

"Charlie Javice, Convicted of Defrauding JPMorgan Chase, Sentenced to Over 7 Years in Prison","Prior to her sentencing, Javice, 31, told the court she was ""haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous"" A start-up founder convicted of defrauding banking giant JPMorgan Chase was sentenced to 85 months in federal prison on Monday, Sept. 29. Charlie Javice, who was named on the Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list, was found guilty in March of conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud and securities fraud for inflating the number of customers of her company Frank in order to ""fraudulently induce"" JPMorgan to purchase it for $175 million, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. ""Javice perpetrated a $175 million fraud -- repeatedly lying about the success of her startup company and even hiring a data scientist to create fake data to back up her lies,"" said prosecutor Amanda Houle. Prior to her sentencing, Javice, 31, told the court she was ""haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous,"" Associated Press reported. ""Not a day goes by that I do not replay my mistakes, searching for meaning,"" Javice said, per Business Insider. ""Not a day passes that I do not feel profound remorse."" ""I don't think you will be committing any crimes, and I think you will be devoting your life to service,"" US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein told Javice during Monday's sentencing, per Business Insider. ""But others need to be deterred."" According to prosecutors, Javice founded Frank in 2017 to help students simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a government form for students seeking financial aid for college or graduate school. Federal prosecutors said in 2021 Javice began to pursue buyers for Frank, one of which was JPMorgan. ""Javice represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or 'users,'"" according to a press release. ""In fact, Frank had approximately 300,000 users."" According to prosecutors, when the banking giant wanted to verify the number of Frank's users and the amount of data collected about them, Javice allegedly created a ""synthetic data set"" to add more customers -- and even ""caused"" a third-party vendor to ""convey"" the phony spreadsheet to JPMorgan.

"Developers CRG, Related Midwest break ground on Illinois quantum computing park","Gov. JB Pritzker's vision for South Chicago to become the Silicon Valley of quantum computing is taking shape. Developers and elected officials broke ground Tuesday on the state's quantum campus, where Palo Alto, California-based PsiQuantum will build the country's first utility-scale quantum computer. The first phase is about 30 acres and designed by Lamar Johnson Collaborative. It comes more than a year after Pritzker, alongside developers, city and county leaders, announced the 128-acre Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park at the former U.S. Steel South Works facility. Co-developers CRG and Related Midwest purchased the land from U.S. Steel this month -- the last step needed after the project netted city approvals last year. The developers received financing for the land purchase from funds managed by private credit lender Blue Owl Capital. ""This project has been marked by individuals who decided this was going to happen and wouldn't let it not happen,"" Related Midwest CEO Curt Bailey said. ""Number one [on] the list: Governor Pritzker."" The park is estimated to have an economic impact of $50 billion over the next 20 years, Mayor Brandon Johnson said. It's also projected to create thousands of jobsfrom quantum computing to construction and retail. PsiQuantum will create 150 jobs, as the campus' anchor tenant. The 500-person company expects to hire more as it grows its presence at the campus. The park is the crown jewel of what Related Midwest and CRG have dubbed Quantum Shore Chicago, the 440 acres where U.S. Steel used to operate. The steel mill closed in 1992, and various redevelopment plans for the site withered over the years. Developers envision Quantum Shore as a hub for innovation, drawing businesses from fields such as quantum computing, technology and health care. Advocate Health Care will build a new 52-bed hospital on Quantum Shore's north end. The park will consist of more than 100 acres on the south end of the site. It will include a cryoplant, equipment labs, research and office spaces for local universities and private companies. PsiQuantum will occupy a 80,700-square-foot office and research building, and several buildings will be built in the future for the company. Quantum computing creates infinite combinations of the binary bits used by computers to calculate larger and more complex problems. It could lead to the manufacturing of new medical drugs and make sensitive data almost impermeable to hacking, among other possibilities touted by experts. Other companies like IBM and Diraq recently announced they'll join the park. The U.S. Department of Defense's research and development agency, or DARPA, will also take residency, where it will establish a program to test quantum computing prototypes. ""This can be an engine of transformational economic growth,"" Pritzker said of the campus. ""With new jobs at all skill levels, innovation at a rapid pace and a global scale, and a major influx of demand in construction and manufacturing and retail and agriculture and services and beyond -- that is a level of impact that can anchor growth for Illinois and a revitalization of this very neighborhood that will span generations."" Some small businesses and neighbors are excited about the benefits the quantum campus will bring, after the land sat underutilized for decades. But others have reservations. The Coalition for South Works CBA has been pushing for a legally binding agreement, or a community benefits agreement, that would ensure residents benefit from the project. The coalition includes residents and more than 40 organizations like the Alliance of the Southeast, as well as businesses and churches. The coalition presented an updated community benefits agreement in early September, which sought assurances that residents wouldn't be poisoned by contaminants lingering at the site, displaced by rising property values and would benefit from the site through new jobs. Community members, who held their own press conference Tuesday, said they wanted to meet with developers and the governor's office to discuss what reinvesting in South Chicago should look like. ""For this to work, all parties must work together,"" resident Freddie Batchelor said. ""Let the community -- meaning the coalition -- come to the table in the form of a community benefits agreement. Let's create a win-win situation."" A spokesperson for Related Midwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the community benefits agreement.. Related has said the development team will ""prioritize small and emerging local businesses,"" during the construction and operation of Quantum Shore Chicago. It also plans build affordable housing on vacant lots in the neighborhood. Jorge Perez, owner of bakery Chico's Oven in South Chicago, said he's been waiting years for something new at the old U.S. Steel South Works site. He said his father worked at the steel mill. Perez set up shop in South Chicago with the hope ""that one day, something would happen here."" He thinks the impact of the park will reverberate throughout South Chicago, bringing more companies. ""I know others are coming; it's just a matter of time. We've been stuck on this moment for a long, long time waiting for this,"" Perez said. ""South Chicago is open for business.""",Chicago Sun-Times,2025-10-01T10:00:04Z,https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/10/01/related-midwest-crg-breaks-ground-illinois-quantum-computing-park-us-steel-south-works,2025-10-01 18:30:20.301854,0.02745098039215677
22 million paying over the odds for energy bills - here's how to save up to £715,"By switching providers, households can save an average of £271, and 1 in 10 can save up to £715 per year. Although energy bills fell by 7% in July to £1,720 for the average household, they are still almost £500 a year more than the average energy bill in April 2021, and are expected to rise by another £100 in April next year Alastair Douglas, Below, TotallyMoney CEO, says the best way to save is to switch: ""The reality is that you won't be left without heating or electricity. Your pipes and plugs stay the same, and the only change is who sends you the bill. ""Most switches take place within seven working days, and your new supplier handles all the paperwork - so you have nothing to worry about. They'll even contact your old supplier to cancel your account. All you'll need to do is give a final meter reading and you're done."" No, This is physically impossible because your gas and electricity flows through the same pipes and cables regardless of who is charging you. ""Engineers will only need to visit if you're moving house or getting a new meter installed. For a standard switch, no one needs to come to your home,"" says Alastair. He adds: ""Energy firms need to be more transparent with customers, because these myths are not only leaving households cold, but also out of pocket. 22 million are currently paying the maximum amount suppliers are allowed to charge for energy. ""Loyalty doesn't pay, but changing energy suppliers can - and that's why we've launched a new energy switching service. Comparing providers takes minutes, and your energy supply won't be affected during the changeover. So, check to see if you're free to switch, and if you've not changed providers in the last year, then it's likely that you can start saving money."" (Image: Nous) Greg Marsh, household finance expert and CEO of AI money-saving tool Nous.co, agrees: ""Most can save hundreds of pounds a year by switching to a new fixed deal. Households who switch with Nous.co typically save more than £150."" He also recommends making sure your direct debit is set at the right level. ""It's a good idea to have some credit built up around now, but not too much. If you've got credit worth more than twice what you pay each month in credit, you should reduce your monthly payments,"" he says. -- Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) September 22, 2025 He says: ""If your home doesn't have a smart meter, take a manual reading on the day, or as soon as you can afterwards. Otherwise you may be charged for too much energy under the new price cap. ""Turning the thermostat in your home down by just 1°C can reduce your energy bills by as much as 10%, for a typical household that's around £17 a month."" If given the go-ahead, new tariffs could be available by the end of January. Standing charges are applied daily, regardless of how much energy the customer uses, and are used to cover the cost of supplying energy to homes and businesses. They also cover the costs of building new network infrastructure and keeping the power on when energy suppliers go bust. Recommended reading: Martin McCluskey, minister for energy consumers, says of the reduced Standing Charge proposals: ""Consumers should have freedom and choice when choosing an energy tariff that works for them. ""This proposal will make more tariffs available on the market, giving people more options to pay lower standing charges if that suits their needs. ""It is an important step towards building an energy market that puts families first and we will continue to look at how we can go further."" Ofgem said the new lower standing charge tariff mandate would be likely to only be a short-term measure while it moots permanent changes to allocate costs within the system, as the UK shifts towards renewable energy.",Daily Echo Sport,2025-10-01T09:58:54Z,https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/25508377.ofgem-price-cap-22-million-paying-maximum-energy-bills/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.302374,0.1294117647058823
Skills training to support Guinea's industrial transformation - ECDPM,"Guinea has among the largest bauxite reserves in the world. Adding domestic value to these reserves is both a political and a development priority for Guinea. But persistent skills shortages remain a significant constraint. At the same time, access to bauxite is a geopolitical priority for the EU, where critical raw materials (CRMs) are at the heart of its green transition and industrial competitiveness. Meeting both Guinean and EU objectives requires investments in human capital development. This policy brief analyses an approach being undertaken to address systemic skills shortage and drive industrial transformation through a public-private development partnership. It outlines the rationale for Guinea's newly created Centre d'Excellence et de Perfectionnement pour l'Industrie et l'Alumine de Guinée (CEPIAG). It looks at key challenges and emerging lessons from its design phase, and conditions necessary for the initiative's success. It draws insights from a recent political economy analysis (PEA) of Guinea's skills ecosystem in relation to the emerging alumina industry, conducted as part of UNIDO's WISE framework (1), and a multi-stakeholder workshop facilitated by ECDPM, which carried out this analysis. (2) Guinean efforts to promote local value addition in the bauxite sector are gathering new momentum. The country holds an estimated 40 billion tons of bauxite reserves, representing around one-third of global reserves, with 23 billion tons located in the Boké region. In 2024, the country was the world's leading bauxite exporter, with 145 million tons shipped. Yet, the potential to convert this mineral wealth into human development is constrained by, among other factors, the lack of local skilled labour and suppliers. As a result, the majority of the exports are raw materials, destined for China to be refined. Direct job creation in bauxite refining is limited due to the capital intensity of downstream activities. It is therefore key for Guinea's local content policies to focus on developing domestic capabilities to supply to refineries, i.e. generate backward linkages. Without a strong supplier base that fills the 'missing middle' between small (and mainly informal firms) and large foreign and sophisticated operators, most of the economic value will flow abroad. Persistent skills shortages remain a significant constraint, hindering Guinea's ambitions of greater value addition and beneficiation of raw materials. The national education system faces challenges in producing a skilled industrial workforce needed for many specialised roles (including engineers, industrial mechanics, electricians and precision welders), forcing companies to rely on expatriate workers. Additionally, the lack of skilled workers in industrial maintenance services also hinders local suppliers' ability to meet industrial sector's standards. Guinea's education and industrial systems involve multiple ministries and agencies, often with overlapping mandates, weak coordination systems, and limited institutional capacities to design and implement policies. More specifically, skills development in Guinea falls under the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education (MESRSI) and the Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (METFPE), with additional sectoral roles played by the Ministry of Mines and Geology (MMG) and the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and SMEs (MCIPME). These factors put significant brakes on turning Guinea's mineral potential into reality. The Alteo Refinery Guinea (ARG) is a €1.5 million greenfield project aimed at constructing a state-of-the-art alumina refinery in Kamsar. ARG investment project will meet 9 to 10% of the European union's demand for specialised alumina and up to 95% of its gallium needs, with buyers exclusively based in the EU. ARG was declared a project of national interest by the Guinean government in May 2024, marking a turning point: it projects generating value addition equivalent to 3% of Guinea's GDP, and includes the creation of the CEPIAG, a public Center of Excellence designed to address the country's persistent industrial skills gap. The ARG investment reflects a broader shift to implement the 2011 Mining Code (amended in 2013) that increases pressure on mining companies to invest in local refining. The Government of Guinea, Alteo and UNIDO therefore entered into a public-private development partnership (PPDP) to facilitate the design and implementation of the CEPIAG to ensure a suitable trained, skilled workforce. CEPIAG's mission is not just to fill immediate vacancies (of 800 workers) in the ARG refinery, but to become a catalyst for long-term economic and workforce transformation. (3) It is designed to help Guinea's shift from raw material exporter to industrial player, by creating a pipeline of skilled workers and suppliers meeting the needs of the mineral processing sector, and other industries. In this way, the CEPIAG is a promising private-led, public-good-oriented skills solution. Moreover, to ensure long-term sustainability the CEPIAG is intended to be integrated into, and to strengthen, existing national education institutions, rather than bypassing the public education and training system or creating a parallel system. Boké is strategically positioned at the centre of Guinea's mining activities, making it a potential lever for both industrial and educational development, serving not just national but also regional needs. Based on context and institutional analyses, two existing public institutions have been selected for the CEPIAG: the 'Ecole Régionale d'Arts et Métiers de Boké' for the technical training component and the 'Institut Supérieur des Mines et Géologie de Boké' for the higher education component. In fulfilling the CEPIAG's dual objectives of addressing the skilled labor needs of an individual investor (Alteo) and strengthening Guinea's broader education and industrial systems, several challenges became apparent. These offer valuable lessons for other opportunity-driven TVET initiatives. Reconcile immediate needs with structural reform The CEPIAG's dual objectives represent different timelines and scope - whereas ARG represents an immediate skills need of an individual refinery investment, systemic change within Guinea's education system is a long-term ambition - and underlying priorities don't naturally align. There is a deeper tension between the way the two actors operate - while industry is faster to react and adapt, driven by short-term operational demands and profit considerations, public institutions, are focused on long-term sustainability, often move slower, and grapple with limited resources, bureaucratic fragmentation, and competing political and budgeting priorities. Thus, the CEPIAG must follow a sequencing process to balance immediate (private) and long-term (public) priorities. To achieve this, the CEPIAG will deliver tailored-made one year training courses for the ARG during the construction and commissioning phases. This will be accompanied by simultaneous efforts to reform the country's higher education and TVET system by developing long-term courses that can be rolled-out in other training centers, including modular professional training courses for other employers. Focus on transferable skills Beyond the specific needs of the ARG, public curricula and training programmes must prioritise foundational industrial skills in trades where high demand is projected. These include industrial mechanics, electricity, welding, industrial engineering, and chemistry, among others. Given the broad applicability of these skills, workers in these trades will be employable beyond the scope of a single industrial project, ensuring long-term workforce adaptability and sustainability. Industry-driven skills development There is a tension between being demand-driven for specific investments and demand-driven for the labour market as a whole. In order to meet the wider economic transformation needs of the economy, curricula must be demand-driven to meet labour market expectations. This involves co-developing curricula with industry - beyond specific firms - prioritising practical training over theory (including internships or apprenticeships), and equipping training centres with modern training equipment and trained trainers that can prepare trainees for current industry standards. The challenge is to respond to the narrower, specific, short-term investment needs of a firm while satisfying wider industry needs. Collective solutions and economies of scale to address skills shortages If designed as a trusted, turnkey solution to address Guinea's industrial skills shortages, the CEPIAG may also help to boost private sector confidence in the national education and TVET system. The ARG investment in the CEPIAG includes support to institutional capacities for opportunity-driven TVET. Further, the purchase of modern equipment, curricula development and training of trainers could serve as a proof of concept for other industrial actors to invest in the CEPIAG, ensuring long-term sustainability for the newly created centre of excellence. This is provided the CEPIAG is framed as a collective solution, not just for the ARG. Achieving this 'crowd-in' effect will require clear communication, strategic compromises and joint ownership by public and private actors, including broader industry engagement in curriculum design. The CEPIAG was officially and legally created in August 2025, as a public Center of Excellence. As the learning curve continues, some issues around the CEPIAG still remain to be resolved. The most prominent among them include the following. Building trust for collaborative governance in the skills sector Beyond the technical and financial challenges, the creation of CEPIAG is also a governance and institutional coordination issue. In order to overcome institutional fragmentation between the multiple ministries with a mandate (see above), and sometimes duplication, the CEPIAG project has already brought together public institutions, a private investor (ARG), and development partners (UNIDO) around a shared objective of skills development for alumina. This alignment must now evolve into functional collaborative governance in the CEPIAG: one that fulfils the vision for systemic change in industrial skills development by effectively engaging private sector (beyond ARG) in its governance, financing and training delivery, while enabling joint public-private leadership, avoiding institutional silos, and ensuring accountability. However, collaborative governance can be slow, clashing with investors' strict timelines, and resulting delays could undermine the ability to address both immediate private sector's needs and long-term workforce development goals. Balancing responsibilities and securing long-term support Key questions still remain on how to ensure the long-term sustainability of the CEPIAG: who should pay, for how long, and under what terms? (4) While Alteo has committed funding to the initial phase (5), future success will depend on defining roles, sharing costs and mobilising diverse funding to ensure financial sustainability of the CEPIAG. The relevant question is how to achieve it in practice. Scaling up of the CEPIAG requires further capital investment, necessitating funds from a wider range of sources, including private firms, development banks and partners. But while private firms will contribute if skills training by CEPIAG are relevant for their workforce, development partners will emphasise public-goods orientation. Private firms may require skills that are plant-specific and as such may be expected to take greater financial responsibility for training in such skills, including capital expenditures, such as the initial investment in infrastructure, equipment, and facilities, curricula development and training of trainers. On the other hand, the costs of highly transferable skills may be more equally distributed with the public sector covering operational costs, including staff salaries, maintenance, and curriculum updates, as these are aligned with its mandate to foster long-term societal benefits. Positioning CEPIAG at the core of Guinea's industrial transformation will require targeted action in other key areas after the pilot phase. These include the following: Empowering local suppliers and SMEs Turning Guinea's resource wealth into real industrial development - along with job creation - will require the emergence of a class of larger and more productive firms that can provide goods and services required for large mining projects. The CEPIAG could play a game-changing role in this regard. With a mandate that goes beyond individual private projects, CEPIAG training could be linked to supplier development, enabling domestic SMEs to scale by building the right technical, managerial and compliance related skills to become such reliable suppliers. Exploring regional opportunities The CEPIAG was conceived to serve Guinea's alumina value chain, but has broader relevance given the largely transferable skills, not just in Guinea but also in the sub-region. In fact, the CEPIAG's long-term viability depends on its ability to serve multiple sectors, attract multiple partners, and meet evolving needs. In that sense, Boké is more than a location, it is a strategic launchpad. With the right support, CEPIAG could evolve into a regional hub for industrial and technical training, similar to AUDA-NEPAD's Centres of Excellence that anticipate sectoral skills needs across Africa, especially in CRM sectors. Realising this ambition requires planning for scale: designing modular programmes in partnership with industry, investing in infrastructure and staff capacity, and forging partnerships with other world-class Centers of Excellence, and regional institutions like ECOWAS, the African Minerals Development Centre (AMDC), among others. Placing skills at the centre of a 'mutually beneficial EU-Africa partnership' The EU's Global Gateway strategy reaffirms that strengthening global supply chains must go hand in hand with investments in human capital, including education, training, and research systems. ARG's investment directly supports the development of the local workforce and indirectly suppliers, driving value addition in the Guinean bauxite-alumina sector, enhancing local industrial capacities, and promoting inclusive economic development. In so doing, it aligns with the EU's strategic objectives of diversifying CRM supply sources and reducing dependence on high-risk providers in the aluminium value chain. The CEPIAG can therefore be positioned as a shared-value project, fostering skills development and industrial growth in Guinea while strengthening Europe's supply chain resilience and corporate sustainability agenda. Beyond this narrative alignment, the strategic relevance of the CEPIAG needs to be optimised by proactively positioning it within EU frameworks, particularly those related to CRMs, and mutually beneficial investments, and engaging relevant EU instruments. (6) At the same time, challenges around the timelines and modality of the EU's programming and funding cycles also point to the need for a shift towards more flexible and adaptive approaches to support skills development for sustainable investments. (7) Importance of a neutral facilitator As highlighted above, public and private entities work with very different timelines, with distinct ambitions and objectives. Thus, a public-private partnership, while potentially serving the public good, requires much coordination and facilitation to derive benefits. Such facilitation requires time, resources and specialised expertise to align expectations, build institutional capacities to drive public-private collaboration in TVET and strengthen the CEPIAG, until such a time that it can stand independently.

3 Undervalued International Value ETFs,"Zachary Evens: Markets keep chugging ahead despite everything going on in the world, contributing to swollen valuations just about everywhere you look. A handful of areas remain undervalued despite broader growth, though. International stocks have lagged for a long time but clawed back lost ground in 2025. Even still, the portfolios of some international value ETFs are still undervalued more than halfway through 2025. If stock prices converge with their fair value estimates, it could offer compelling upside for investors. Moreover, a renewed emphasis for some of the more steady but economically significant global companies could spur further growth, too. These three undervalued international value ETFs are poised to benefit. First up is Schwab Fundamental International Equity ETF, which trades under the ticker FNDF. It charges just 25 basis points a year and returned 21% over the first seven months of the year. That's a great run, but not enough to pull its price back up to the portfolio's fair value estimate. This is a unique ETF. It will be nudged by market trends, but its contrarian index means that it still generally marches to the beat of its own drum. It tracks a research affiliate's fundamental index, which includes developed-market stocks outside the United States. Instead of weighting its holdings by market capitalization, this index weights stocks by several fundamental metrics, including sales and cash flow. At each rebalance, it increases exposure to the stocks that have become cheaper relative to those metrics and trims those that have become more expensive. The result is an allocation firmly on the value side of the Morningstar Style Box but still diversified across most of the international developed market. As international stocks rallied this year, the fund benefited from stakes in several high-performing global conglomerates like Samsung SSNLF and Shell SHEL. Consistent exposure to steady companies coupled with broad diversification should extend its track record of solid risk-adjusted returns and earns the ETF a Silver Morningstar Medalist Rating. Next up is iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF, ticker EFV. It charges 33 basis points annually and also earns a Silver Morningstar Medalist Rating. It effectively courts the value factor and should do well when value stocks do well. The ETF market-cap weights the cheaper half of the broad-based MSCI EAFA index. Market-cap weighting is an efficient way to build the portfolio since it harnesses the market's collective wisdom of the relative value of each stock. This keeps turnover low and ensures the ETF accurately portrays the international value market. Like peers, it leans into financial stocks, but that lean is more pronounced here. Multinational banks are some of the biggest global stocks, so they claim more weight here than elsewhere. This means large banks like HSBC HSBC and Allianz ALIZY can steer fund performance. Luckily, they did well to start the year and helped the fund earn its 23% return in 2025 through July. The last ETF performed the best of the three through the first seven months of 2025. Dimensional International Value ETF, ticker DFIV, returned nearly 24% in 2025 through July, placing it near the top of the foreign large-value category. It earns a Silver Medalist Rating and charges 27 basis points annually. The ETF follows a strategy familiar to Dimensional investors. It maintains a highly diversified portfolio but leans into smaller stocks, profitable stocks, and those trading at low valuations. Profitability and low valuations have historically been associated with market-beating returns, so that should give the fund a long-term edge.

"CREDAI, NAREDCO urge RBI to cut repo rate in next meet to enhance housing demand","New Delhi, Oct 1 (PTI) Realtors' body CREDAI and NAREDCO on Wednesday urged the RBI to reduce the key repo rate in the next monetary policy to boost demand for residential properties, especially of affordable homes. They also hoped that banks would pass on the benefits of previous rate cuts to existing and new home loan borrowers. On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept key interest rates unchanged as it waited for greater clarity on the impact of US tariffs as well as playout of earlier rate cuts and recent tax reductions. Since February, the repo rate has been cut by 100 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Commenting on the RBI policy, CREDAI National President Shekhar Patel, said, ""The RBI's decision to hold the repo rate at 5.5 per cent gives the housing sector the steadiness it needs amid global uncertainty. Predictable borrowing costs allow buyers to plan long-term and give developers the clarity to progress financing and projects."" He noted that the recent GST rates rationalisation has lifted consumer sentiment and increased demand across sectors. ""While markets had anticipated a 25-basis point cut today, we remain hopeful the RBI will deliver a cumulative 50-basis point easing this fiscal in two tranches, which would further support activity,"" Patel said. It is essential that banks pass these benefits to both new and existing borrowers so policy continuity and tax reform translate into sustained demand through the festive season, the CREDAI President said. During the first nine months of the 2025 calendar year, housing sales have been lower across the top seven cities compared to the year-ago period, due to the higher base effect and also a sharp rise in prices of residential properties in the primary (first sale) housing markets of these cities. G Hari Babu, National President of NAREDCO, said, ""The decision to keep the repo rate at 5.5 per cent alongside the projected real GDP growth of 6.8 per cent is welcome. However, just as the government has boosted various sectors by cutting GST, a reduction in the repo rate is needed to energise the real estate sector."" He urged the RBI to consider bringing the repo rate below 5.5 per cent in the next MPC meeting. ""Lower interest rates will strengthen homebuyers' confidence, increase housing demand, and particularly benefit the affordable housing segment. Supporting industries linked to real estate, such as cement, steel, electricals, piping, and interiors, will also see growth,"" said Hari Babu. CREDAI and NAREDCO are the two major industry bodies of real estate developers with a combined membership of more than 15,000.

"758,000 could be owed thousands by HMRC - here's how to access your money","HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is urging the 758,000 eligible people who have not claimed their matured Child Trust Fund to find their accounts, worth on average £2,242 each. Child Trust Funds are long term, tax-free savings accounts which were set up for children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 with an initial government deposit of at least £250. Young people can take control of their account at 16, but once the account holder turns 18 it matures, and they can decide whether they want to withdraw the money or re-invest it. The eligible people are now aged between 18 - 23 years old. Angela MacDonald, HMRC's Second Permanent Secretary and Deputy Chief Executive, says: ""If you're between 18 and 23, you could be sat on a savings payout and not even realise it. Just search 'find my Child Trust Fund' on GOV.UK to find your savings account today"". With September being the most common birth month, thousands of 18 year olds have become eligible to claim their Child Trust Fund savings pot. If young people, or their parents or guardians already know who their Child Trust Fund provider is, they can contact them directly. More than 563,000 young people went online to find their Child Trust Fund in the 12 months to the end of August 2025. September 2024 was the busiest month when over 71,000 searches were submitted. It takes about 5 minutes to submit a request to find a Child Trust Fund using the online tool and, for most, less than 3 weeks to hear back. You just need the young person's National Insurance number and date of birth. For those who don't have their National Insurance number to hand, they can quickly and easily download it from the HMRC app and keep it in their digital wallet for whenever it's needed. Shelley Doorey-Williams, CEO of the London Foundation for Banking & Finance says: ""As a committed member of the YFCG (Youth Financial Capability Group), the London Foundation for Banking & Finance welcomes HMRC's call for young people to claim their Child Trust Fund savings. Recommended reading: ""It's encouraging to see the Government making efforts to reunite people with money they may not even realise was theirs. ""With an estimated average of £2,242 waiting in unclaimed accounts, this is real money at a crucial time, that can help young people right at the start of their financial lives."" The savings accounts are not held by government but are held in banks, building societies or other saving providers.

The EU's ambitions need African resources: Can it disrupt Chinese-controlled supply chains?,"The EU's green and digital ambitions depend on a stable supply of critical raw materials like lithium, cobalt and graphite. With growing concerns over value chain security and dependence on single countries like China, the EU has launched the Critical Raw Materials Act to build more resilient supply chains. But how can Europe build new partnerships, particularly in Africa, to achieve this? In this episode of Europolis, Chloe Teevan is joined by ECDPM's Poorva Karkare, senior policy analyst and expert on industrialisation and regional integration in Africa. They discuss the complexities of the EU's strategy, the role of partner countries in Africa, the much-discussed Lobito Corridor project, and the unavoidable influence of China. Poorva argues that true strategic autonomy for the EU may require innovative partnerships that leverage, rather than exclude, Chinese capabilities in African countries. Why is Europe suddenly so concerned about raw materials? The EU's push for a Critical Raw Materials Act isn't happening in a vacuum. It's a direct response to a world of increasing geopolitical shocks and fragile supply chains, a reality driven home by the COVID-19 pandemic. The conversation explores how this quest for ""strategic autonomy"" is rooted in fears of dependency, particularly on China, which could weaponise its control over these essential resources. A clash of perspectives: 'Critical' vs. 'Strategic' minerals The language used by different actors reveals a major challenge. For the EU, minerals like lithium and cobalt are 'critical' inputs for its green and digital industries. But for African partner countries, they are 'strategic' assets for building their own economies. This episode unpacks how these nations are no longer content to simply export raw resources; they are demanding opportunities for local value addition, processing, and industrialisation as part of any new deal. Can the much-hyped Lobito Corridor really cut out China? The Lobito Corridor, an ambitious infrastructure project linking the DRC and Zambia to an Angolan port, is often hailed as Europe's answer to Chinese dominance. The reality is far more entangled. From the Chinese-rehabilitated railways and ports to the Chinese joint ventures in the mines themselves, China's presence is deeply embedded in the project. The discussion reveals that even with this new route, the raw materials are still destined for one place for processing: China. A pragmatic path forward: If you can't beat them, work with them? Given China's manufacturing prowess, its dominance in refining, and Europe's own high energy costs, competing head-on is not a realistic strategy. This episode explores a more pragmatic and controversial idea: what if the EU leveraged its market power to incentivise Chinese companies to move their refining operations to Africa? This could create a win-win-win scenario: Africa gets value-adding industries, the EU gets a more secure supply of refined materials, and China retains access to the European market. Are the EU's tools fit for a new strategic purpose? High-level strategy is one thing, but on-the-ground implementation is another. A fascinating case study from Guinea, involving a French firm's plan to build an alumina refinery, exposes a critical gap. The EU's existing development and cooperation instruments are often not designed to support these kinds of large-scale, strategic industrial projects. The conversation highlights how this mismatch between ambition and available tools poses a significant hurdle to the EU's new agenda.",ECDPM,2025-10-01T10:07:10Z,https://ecdpm.org/work/eus-ambitions-need-african-resources-can-it-disrupt-chinese-controlled-supply-chains,2025-10-01 18:30:20.306289,0.02745098039215677

ADB aims to boost cooperation with Azerbaijan's private sector,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) carries out approximately 8 billion dollars of private sector investments annually, and we intend to increase this, said Marina Rose Best, the Asian Development Bank's Country Director for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, during a panel discussion on the third day of the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), APA-Economics reports. She noted that there are concrete examples in this direction in Azerbaijan: ""In 2023, we allocated a $10 million loan to the Veyseloglu company. This is for delivering products along the value chain to the market. There was also a climate component -- the company purchased electric refrigerated trucks for food transportation. Products are even stored at different temperature regimes in the vehicles: ice cream in one compartment, apples in another. This increased logistics efficiency. Additionally, we provided a $500,000 technical assistance grant to enable farmers to join this value chain. In 2021, we approved a $20 million loan for ""Məktəbəqədər Subika"", aimed at strengthening microfinance services for small farmers. That same year, a $5.9 million loan was allocated to the Avrora company. This also supported the logistics and market access value chain for agricultural products."" ""All this shows that cooperation with the private sector is very important for supporting agriculture. We want to further increase our involvement in this area in Azerbaijan.

"Nigeria @65: The Worst Is Over, Tinubu Tells Nigerians","Glamtush reports that President Bola Tinubu on Wednesday assured Nigerians that the country's ""worst days are over."" He declared that his economic reforms are beginning to deliver results and that hope is rising for a more prosperous nation. Tinubu gave the assurance in his nationwide broadcast to celebrate Nigeria's 65th Independence Day anniversary. Tinubu said his administration had chosen ""the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today"" since coming into office in May 2023, and that Nigerians are now beginning to see tangible results. ""I am pleased to report that we have finally turned the corner. The worst is over, I say. ""Yesterday's pains are giving way to relief. I salute your endurance, support, and understanding. ""I will continue to work for you and justify the confidence you reposed in me to steer the ship of our nation to a safe harbour,"" the President said. Tinubu hailed the resilience of Nigerians, saying the country had survived a civil war, military rule and political crises, and is still striving to build ""a more perfect union."" He described the 65th anniversary as a moment for reflection on the sacrifices of the nation's founding fathers and the progress achieved since Independence in 1960. The President highlighted achievements in education and healthcare, noting that Nigeria has grown from just two tertiary institutions at Independence to 274 universities, 183 polytechnics and 236 colleges of education by 2024. Tinubu defended his economic reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies and the unification of foreign exchange rates, which he said ended decades of distortions and rent-seeking. According to him, these difficult decisions freed resources for investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare and social programmes. He argued, ""In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. ""Our administration has redirected the economy towards a more inclusive path, channelling money to fund education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and critical economic infrastructure."" The President reeled out a list of 12 economic milestones achieved in the last two years and four months in office. He said Nigeria's GDP grew by 4.23 per cent in the second quarter of 2025, the fastest in four years, while inflation had declined to 20.12 per cent, the lowest level in three years. The President added that non-oil revenue had risen sharply, debt service costs had reduced, foreign reserves had increased to $42.03bn, and the tax-to-GDP ratio had grown to 13.5 per cent. He also noted that Nigeria had posted trade surpluses for five consecutive quarters, with manufactured exports up by 173 per cent and non-oil exports now representing 48 per cent of total trade. Oil production, he said, had recovered to 1.68 million barrels per day, while local refining had restarted for the first time in four decades, alongside the export of aviation fuel. Tinubu argued that the naira had grown more stable. He also boasted of improvements in credit ratings, a booming stock market, and the Central Bank's first interest rate cut in five years as evidence of renewed investor confidence. The President said his government was investing heavily in security to consolidate economic gains. ""They are winning the war against terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes. We see their victories in their blood and sweat to stamp out Boko Haram terror in the North-East, IPOB/ESN terror in the South-East and banditry and kidnapping,"" he said, adding that peace had returned to hundreds of communities and thousands of displaced persons had gone back home. He also promised to prioritise food security and agricultural production to lower food costs. ""We must build the roads we need, repair the ones that have become decrepit, and construct the schools our children will attend and the hospitals that will care for our people. We have to plan for the generations that will come after us,"" Tinubu said. Addressing young Nigerians, the President described them as the ""greatest assets of this blessed country,"" highlighting initiatives such as the Nigeria Education Loan Fund, which has already benefited over 500,000 students, and credit schemes like Credicorp and YouthCred that provide loans for housing, devices and resettlement. He added that the government was pushing ahead with the $600m iDICE programme, backed by international development partners, to support the digital and creative sectors. Under the social investment programme, Tinubu said N330bn had been disbursed to eight million households. He also cited significant progress in transport infrastructure, including rail, roads, airports, and seaports, with major projects such as the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway and the Eastern Rail Project underway. Tinubu acknowledged the pain of reforms but urged Nigerians to remain patient. ""I have always candidly acknowledged that these reforms have come with some temporary pains. ""The biting effects of inflation and the rising cost of living remain a significant concern to our government. ""However, the alternative of allowing our country to descend into economic chaos or bankruptcy was not an option,"" he said. The president concluded his third Independence Day address with a call for productivity and national unity, saying, ""Let us be a nation of producers, not just consumers. Let us farm our land and build factories to process our produce. ""Let us patronise 'Made-in-Nigeria' goods. I say Nigeria first. Let us pay our taxes. Finally, let all hands be on deck. ""With Almighty God on our side, I can assure you that the dawn of a new, prosperous, self-reliant Nigeria is here.""",Glamtush,2025-10-01T09:58:40Z,https://glamtush.com/nigeria-65-the-worst-is-over-tinubu-tells-nigerians/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.307441,0.3490196078431373

How Chapman's is making ice cream Canada's comfort food,"David Olive is a Toronto-based business columnist for the Star. Ice cream ranks high on the list of discretionary items that are among the first to be cut from household budgets in difficult economic times. So, it's a surprise that Chapman's, Canada's biggest independent ice-cream maker, has just announced a $200-million expansion to its facilities in Markdale, Ont. The 175,000 sq. ft. expansion, which adds a third plant to Chapman's production complex, is supported by an interest-free loan of as much as $27 million from the Ontario government. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW It will make Chapman's the largest single-site ice-cream producer in North America. Even during the current cost-of-living crisis, demand is growing for Chapman's products. The firm makes about 280 items including ice-cream bars, cones and sandwiches, frozen yogurt, sorbet and water ice treats. Chapman's needs more capacity for a planned wider range of products, and for potential overseas expansion. It's a wonder that this all-Canadian enterprise has thrived against the colossi of Switzerland's Nestlé S.A. (Parlour, Häagen-Dazs), the world's biggest food company, and Britain's Unilever PLC (Ben & Jerry's, Breyers, Good Humor). The two offshore Chapman's rivals boast combined revenues of $258 billion. As a private, family-owned business, Chapman's doesn't disclose its financial performance. But Chapman's says it is posting record revenues. Chapman's has greatly benefited from the Buy Canadian movement. ""Since March, we've seen month-over-month record sales,"" Ashley Chapman, son of co-founders Penny and David Chapman and chief operating officer of the firm, said at a news conference in September. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""Canadians are really picking up this anti-American sentiment, and that couldn't be better for Chapman's ice cream right now,"" he said. But the secret of the 52-year-old Chapman's success might be its commitment to new-product development. In addition to traditional ice cream, Chapman's makes frozen treats that are free of nuts, gluten, added sugar, lactose and eggs. It also makes low-calorie, non-allergenic and kosher products. Chapman's latest new flavours include peach melba and butter tart ice cream, which COO Chapman describes as a ""quintessentially Canadian flavour."" Chapman's two existing plants are in Markdale, a hamlet of about 1,200 people in Grey County south of Owen Sound. Chapman's will increase its workforce by about 200 people when its newest plant comes onstream next year, raising total employment to more than 1,000 workers. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The starting wage at Chapman's is $22.75, compared with Ontario's minimum wage, which rises to $17.60 on Oct. 1. Husband and wife entrepreneurs Penny and David Chapman had just six employees when they launched their business in 1973. They started with only 15 flavours. The couple opted against the common practice at the time of selling to scoop shops that served highway traffic and instead sold only to retailers. Today, Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro carry wide selections of Chapman's products. Their labelling is sometimes misleading, though. The big grocers' online stores often identify foreign brands as ""Prepared in Canada,"" wrongly suggesting that they are made by Canadian firms. Oddly, Metro's online store awards bold maple leaf icons to the likes of Häagen-Dazs but to only a few of the many Chapman's products it carries. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW This is unlikely to be a banner year in profits for Chapman's. The Chapman family decided in March to freeze its prices until the end of the year. Chapman's will absorb tariff-related extra costs, unlike Walmart and other major firms that have said they will pass the added costs to their customers. ""Food insecurity was already an unacceptable problem in Canada,"" Ashley Chapman told Toronto Life magazine in March in explaining why he and his parents decided to freeze prices. ""Tariffs are just going to make everything worse."" Ashley Chapman has been scrambling this year to find alternatives to Chapman's longtime U.S. suppliers of fruits and nuts, including almonds (California), pecans (Georgia) and black cherries (Michigan). Chapman's is increasingly sourcing from Europe, and Ashley Chapman expects the change will be permanent. ""We've got to get rid of the uncertainty in our business,"" Chapman said. ""And unfortunately, sourcing anything from the United States equals uncertainty under (U.S. President Donald) Trump."" Chapman's is ""doing some major changes and giving a lot more business to Canadians firms instead of American,"" he said. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""These are two-, three- and four-year contracts. So even if Donald Trump wakes up smarter than he did yesterday"" the U.S. suppliers will be out of luck, Chapman said. Chapman supports Canada's supply management system in dairy products that protects from foreign competition the small family farms that supply Chapman's. He hopes the system, a target of Trump's ire, isn't bargained away in negotiations between Canada and the U.S. to resolve the trade disruption. With its consumer-friendly pricing, attention to R&D, above-average pay and business expansion at a tough time for Ontario manufacturers, Chapman's is giving new meaning to ice cream as a comfort food.",The Star,2025-10-01T10:06:26Z,https://www.thestar.com/business/the-inside-scoop-on-how-canadas-ice-cream-giant-chapman-s-is-rising-above-tariffs/article_4756f33d-c902-4dcb-8a8c-08b13231afca.html,2025-10-01 18:30:20.308351,-0.003921568627450966
Building Supply Shortage Hits Jakarta's Central Business District,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Colliers Indonesia has stated that the office market in Jakarta is facing a supply constraint, particularly in the Central Business District (CBD). Since the end of 2023, Colliers Indonesia has noted that no new office buildings have entered the CBD market. Head of Research Department at Colliers Indonesia, Ferry Salanto, estimated that this situation would continue until 2027 and that new supply would only be available in 2028. ""Since the end of 2023, until 2027, the supply in the CBD has been very limited, even non-existent. Only around 2028 will there be a new supply,"" he said in a virtual presentation on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. According to Ferry, developers are still hesitant to launch new projects in the CBD. They are waiting for the demand to recover first before deciding to build new office buildings. ""We can see that developers are still holding back and continually monitoring demand growth,"" he said. For the period from 2024 to 2027, an additional supply of new office projects only emerged outside the CBD. From early 2025 until the third quarter, Ferry stated that the new supply is estimated to be around 125,000 square meters, all of which are outside the CBD. ""The total supply in Jakarta is around 11.4 million square meters,"" said Ferry. Out of this total, more than 2 million square meters are still unoccupied. In terms of occupancy, Ferry mentioned that the office occupancy rate in the CBD reached 75.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, outside the CBD, it is 69.3 percent for the same period. When viewed based on building classes in the CBD, the largest vacancy rate, 48.9 percent, is recorded in Class A office buildings, most of which are located in the CBD.

ADB: Preliminary talks underway with Azerbaijan government on agricultural cooperation,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced a $40 billion investment program by 2030 to transform food systems earlier this year, said Marina Rose Best, the Asian Development Bank's Country Director for Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, during a panel discussion on the third day of the Baku Climate Action Week (BCAW2025), APA-Economics reports. She said that part of this approach is also reflected in the ADB's partnership strategy with Azerbaijan: ""There is no need to explain the importance of agriculture for Azerbaijan - you already know it well. But in numbers, about 36% of the population works in agriculture, and it makes a significant contribution to GDP outside the oil and gas sector. However, despite its importance, the sector is seriously underfunded. For example, only 10% of irrigated land has modern irrigation systems. This is a huge gap. The ADB has not been widely involved in agriculture in Azerbaijan so far, but we intend to change this. Initial talks with the government are currently underway."" She said that the areas of interest for the ADB include monitoring and forecasting river basins, modernizing irrigation systems and filling investment gaps, applying digital and new technologies in agriculture, and working directly with farmers to improve their knowledge and skills.

Why fast casual is 'Partying like its 1995',"California Tortilla and Noodles and Co are embracing throwback pricing promotions as part of a broader trend of brands using nostalgia to engage with customers and drive traffic. October 1, 2025 by Cherryh Cansler -- Editor, FastCasual.com Let's take a trip back to 1995. If you needed to talk to a friend, you had to call their house phone and talk to their mom. The biggest fashion trend involved baggy jeans and super thin eyebrows. (Mine have never recovered) ""Netflix and chill"" did not exist. Watching a movie meant spending 30 minutes at Blockbuster looking for a VHS tape that wasn't already rented out, and the only food you could have delivered was pizza or Chinese. Things were simpler, weren't they? Well, two fast casual chains are taking us on a nostalgic trip back to those glory days, celebrating their 30-year anniversaries by offering throwback prices on some of their most popular menu items. California Tortilla, a Maryland-based chain known for its unique Mexican-style fare, offered $5 burritos and bowls on June 18, and Colorado-based Noodles & Co is launching a similar promotion this month when it offers select classic dishes for $4.95 each. The chains are just two of many companies realizing that nostalgia is resonating with customers of all generations. A study by consulting firm Kantar found 52% of 12- to 29-year-old consumers prefer classic brands, and 81% of those young consumers said they liked it when brands brought back products and trends from their childhood. ""Nostalgia is an interpretation of the past, not a reliving of the past,"" said Casey Ferrell, SVP and Head of U.S. and Canada MONITOR, the consumer insights division of global consulting firm Kantar. It only works to drive drive sales when it combines something new along with the old ""It has to say something about the future, while it is bringing back the past,"" Ferrell said. California Tortilla CMO Stacey Kane, agreed, noting that the $5 items meant more to customers than a typical discount. ""We saw almost a 50% increase in comp traffic that day,"" she said in an interview with FastCasual. ""Beyond the discount we held a CalTort Memories Contest that invited guests to look back on their own CalTort stories -- first dates, family traditions, late-night burrito runs -- and relive the personal experiences that made the restaurant part of their lives."" Noodles & Co President and CEO Joe Christina, said the company's campaign will honor the ""flavors and moments that made us who we are while looking ahead to a future filled with craveable classics and bold new twists."" Both companies launched in 1995, and their throwback pricing promotions are part of a broader trend of brands using nostalgia to engage with customers and drive traffic. McDonald's, which brought back its snack wraps on July 10, said visits were up 15%, compared to the year-to-date average, with visits on July 11 increasing 22.3% compared to the year-to-date average. The burger brand has gone all in with its nostalgic marketing, celebrating Grimace's birthday and offering branded Happy Meals, McNugget Buddies and collector cups. It also launched a throwback web portal to hype the return. Taco Bell is hoping for similar results with the recent launch of Y2K menu items, all priced at $3 or less. The limited-edition menu features the Caramel Apple Empanada, Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos, 7-Layer Burrito, Double Decker Taco and Chili Cheese Burrito. ""No one did the 2000s like Taco Bell. That era gave us some of our most iconic menu items, including the Crunchwrap Supreme, which remains one of our best-sellers two decades later,"" Taco Bell CMO Taylor Montgomery said in a company press release. ""Fans have never stopped asking for these items, and honestly, we've missed them too. But Decades Y2K isn't just about the menu. It's about reliving the flavors, the fashion, and the fun that made that moment in time unforgettable - and letting our fans be the first to live it all over again."" Taco Bell has also created the Crunchkin, a digital pet that allows Rewards Members users to care for and feed. As they play, the pet grows, evolving with qualifying Decades Y2K Menu purchases, giving customers access to exclusive in-app mini-games, bonus point challenges and earning Taco Bell Rewards. While it's too early to see if Taco Bell's Y2K campaign is attracting the same traffic increases as McDonald's, it's certainly inspired me to visit more frequently. I've already had a few Chili Cheese Burritos, my college staple. Now, let's work on bringing back those thin eyebrows.",Fast Casual,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.fastcasual.com/blogs/why-fast-casuals-partying-like-its-1995/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.309122,0.2941176470588236
"Niger: Arbitration Tribunal Sides With Orano on Uranium Stock, Escalating Niger Dispute - The North Africa Journal","An international arbitration panel has ordered Niger to halt any sale or transfer of uranium currently at the center of a high-stakes dispute with French mining group Orano, following the country's recent nationalization of the Somaïr mine. The provisional measure from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) temporarily restricts the government's ability to dispose of contested uranium output and comes after Niger unilaterally revoked longstanding mining deals with its former colonial power. Orano, which has operated in Niger since the 1960s and held a majority stake in Somaïr, initiated legal action as authorities in Niamey pursued the mine's full nationalization and leveled accusations over contract non-compliance. The tribunal's order, issued September 23, does not resolve the overall dispute, nor does it reverse nationalization, but it prevents the uranium stock -- estimated at 1,300 metric tons and valued around 250 million euros -- from being marketed while litigation continues. In parallel, the panel called for the release of Orano's detained representative, echoing a July Nigerien appellate court decision. The uranium row underscores a dramatic break in Franco-Nigerien relations since Niger's July 2023 coup, with political control over the resource and revenue distribution now fueling broader tensions. France has long depended on Niger's uranium for its nuclear fleet, while Niger argues decades of extraction have yielded limited benefit for its own population, pointing to widespread poverty in mining regions. Meanwhile, the closure of borders and breakdown in cross-border logistics have left the disputed uranium stranded in-country. While the tribunal's latest ruling grants Orano a tactical win on asset security, key questions on legal jurisdiction, national sovereignty, and future export revenues remain unresolved. With both sides entrenched and calls growing within Niger for new international partnerships outside the traditional Franco-African sphere, the dispute's final outcome could reshape regional dynamics related to critical mineral supply and investment.",The North Africa Journal,2025-10-01T10:06:38Z,https://north-africa.com/niger-arbitration-tribunal-sides-with-orano-on-uranium-stock-escalating-niger-dispute/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.309304,-0.2313725490196078
Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tests Key Support as Rebound Zone Returns,"Shibarium's bridge remains in containment while developers push decentralization fixes. In a late-September update, core developer Kaal Dhairya said attackers used unauthorized validator signing power on September 12 to push a malicious exit through the PoS bridge. The team froze bridge operations, began outside reviews, and outlined steps to harden validator controls before any phased reopening. The blog labels the current state as ""containment holding,"" with investigations active and timelines communicated only through official posts. Developers described the exploit method in detail: short-lived stake amplification combined with forged checkpoint and exit proofs enabled withdrawals, indicating problems in validator key protection rather than a single contract bug. They said emergency actions limited losses and revoked attacker permissions while auditors review the flow. Today's status remains unchanged: the bridge stays paused until the audits conclude and new operational policies go live. The next phase centers on decentralization. The team committed to stronger key management and a broader validator set to cut single-point risks. They framed these controls as prerequisites for reactivating normal bridging, with restoration staged and monitored. The update stresses that only the project's blog will post the green light; no alternate channel has published a reopening date. Independent summaries align on the incident's contours. Security write-ups and exchange briefings point to a validator governance capture aided by flash loans, with loss estimates in the low-to-mid single-digit millions. Those reports track subsequent on-chain movement and reiterate that Shibarium's base chain continues operating while the bridge is isolated for review. Away from the bridge, Shiba Inu's governance arm widened participation tools. In August, the Doggy DAO introduced multiple voting methods, allowing proposals to use staking-based votes, direct ERC-20 token voting, or quadratic voting. The change aims to broaden turnout and reduce the outsized sway of large holders. Today's ecosystem notes still reference this shift because it governs how new proposals will advance while security work continues. Project channels framed the update as part of a longer decentralization push. Posts around LEASH v2 and DAO outreach emphasized bringing more holders into formal decision-making while the core team implements technical hardening on Shibarium. That positioning keeps governance active without relying on bridge throughput. Aggregators and explainers echo the same architecture: community voting now spans several strategies, with identity-based options under discussion. That context matters today because any parameter change tied to bridge relaunch -- like validator policies -- will route through these DAO processes and their newer voting rails. On supply activity, third-party trackers provide a running ledger of burn transactions. The live dashboards offer raw transaction links and totals rather than commentary, letting observers separate daily noise from multi-day trends. Today's community chatter cites those ledgers to gauge whether post-incident activity is normalizing. Some news roundups noted flat or low 24-hour burns at points this week, which underscores the value of checking the primary ledger rather than relying on snapshots. The tracker's methodology clarifies that burns count only transfers to dead wallets and the Genesis address, which reduces supply. That definition keeps daily comparisons consistent as community projects resume routines. For operational news, the project's announcements blog remains the authoritative source. Today, no new post adds a bridge reopening date or changes the security posture. Coverage continues to reference the September 20 update as the latest official note, with developers reiterating that audits and decentralization steps must complete first. Shiba Inu is pressing a long-watched horizontal level around $0.00001150. TheCryptoBasic highlighted an X thread noting analyst ""Coinvo"" sees SHIB approaching a ""critical"" area. Although the post mentioned ""resistance,"" the attached TradingView chart marks the line as support, with prior bounces clustered along the same band. The setup puts SHIB at a decision point where market structure either holds or breaks. SHIB is revisiting the same horizontal level that the chart shows as a base through multiple earlier swings. Each touch previously produced rebounds, which is why technicians track the line as a ""rebound zone."" The current move brings price back to that band, compressing volatility against a flat support. Moreover, the highlighted circles on the chart mark several contacts with this line across spring and early summer. Those reactions built a case that buyers defend this area. Consequently, a fresh test draws attention because repeated interactions can either strengthen a level through acceptance or weaken it through attrition. At the same time, the broader context matters. The three-day view in the image shows a sequence of lower highs since late summer. That pattern keeps near-term momentum soft even as price meets support. Therefore, traders will focus on whether this level holds long enough to reverse that series. Earlier in the year, the same support repelled declines and launched counter-trend rallies. Those moves did not create a new uptrend, yet they restored range equilibrium. Thus, the market treated the band as fair value after sharp sells. Additionally, liquidity tends to pool near obvious levels. As price returns to the line, stop orders and resting bids can accelerate the next move. A clean rebound often starts with a swift wick through the level followed by a close back above it; a failure usually shows the opposite: a firm close below and a weak retest from underneath. However, the posted chart does not include volume or momentum overlays. Because of that, analysts will usually pair this structure with confirmation tools -- like a momentum divergence or an expansion in traded volume -- to separate routine ""tags"" from higher-quality reversals. Structurally, SHIB has carved a broad range this year, with the $0.00001150 area acting as the lower boundary on the displayed timeframe. Lower highs into support describe a compression that often resolves with an impulsive move. Direction depends on whether buyers can print a higher low after contact. Yet, near-term bias remains cautious while the series of lower highs persists. A rebound needs follow-through -- strong bodies on candles and acceptance back into the mid-range -- to shift momentum. Without that, bounces can fade into another test of the base. External catalysts still influence the tape. Headlines around Shibarium's security hardening, bridge status, burn-rate chatter, or broader ""altseason"" narratives can change risk appetite quickly. Therefore, structure provides the map, while catalysts decide timing. Community commentator ""Shib Spain,"" cited by TheCryptoBasic, floated that altseason could begin in October. The same thread listed SHIB's October gains in prior years: roughly 833% in 2021, 10.4% in 2022, 6.04% in 2023, and 2.46% in 2024. Those figures explain why some traders watch this month. Even so, seasonality is context, not a catalyst. Market regimes differ. The explosive 2021 move occurred during a broad speculative cycle, while subsequent Octobers delivered far smaller advances. Present structure and liquidity conditions outweigh calendar effects. Therefore, today's focus returns to the charted level. If the market treats $0.00001150 as fair value again, seasonality may amplify a bounce. If not, historical returns will matter less than the immediate breakdown mechanics. Technicians usually look for a forceful close back above support, followed by a higher low on the next pullback, to validate a rebound. That sequence shows buyers doing more than defending an intraday wick; it shows control transferring back to demand. Conversely, a decisive close below the band, then a retest that fails to reclaim it, often confirms a breakdown. In that case, the former support can act as resistance, opening a lower range until new demand emerges. In parallel, observers monitor correlated signals: risk appetite across large-cap alts, BTC dominance shifts, and any project-specific updates that alter flows. These elements help explain whether the move is idiosyncratic to SHIB or part of a wider market rotation.",Coinchapter,2025-10-01T10:00:15Z,https://coinchapter.com/shiba-inu-shib-tests-key-support-as-rebound-zone-returns/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.309940,-0.1372549019607843

Niger Dissolves Hundreds of Private Security Firms in Major Industry Overhaul,"Niger's government has shuttered 400 private security companies by ministerial decree, implementing a sweeping sector-wide reset in an effort to impose tighter conditions and oversight on an industry previously marked by legal ambiguity and fragmented operations. Signed by Interior Minister Mohamed Toumba on September 18, the measure applies new legal standards devised earlier in the year, setting stricter requirements for licensing, management vetting, and arms controls. Existing firms were given a six-month window to comply or face dissolution. Officials described the consolidation as a move to address proliferation and informal practices that posed risks to public safety and left workers exposed to low wages and insufficient protections. The latest order, spanning 12 pages and naming well-known operators as well as smaller entities, signals a pivot toward formal regulation and government supervision. Thousands of security workers now face immediate job loss, while businesses and institutions reliant on outside protection must seek new, compliant service providers. The broader impact of the reform -- and whether it will deliver both improved public safety and better employment standards -- remains to be seen.

"Despite being painted as a war zone by Trump, Choose Chicago data shows record summer hotel occupancy","Chicago may be a ""hellhole"" according to President Donald Trump, but the city by the lake proved a pretty attractive destination for visitors over the summer, generating records for hotel occupancy and revenue. From June through August, hotels in Chicago's Central Business District booked nearly 3.6 million room nights, a 4.3% gain over 2024 that topped the pre-COVID record in the summer of 2019, according to data released Tuesday by Choose Chicago, the city's tourism arm. Chicago hotels also set a new revenue record, generating $949 million over the three months, up .8% over last summer. ""We had a record breaking summer,"" said Kristen Reynolds, Choose Chicago's president and CEO. ""And we're doing it in a time with incredible headwinds, where most other tourism destinations are happy to be flat and not significantly down."" Those headwinds included everything from reduced international travel to the U.S. in the wake of Trump's immigration and tariff policies to a domestic economic slowdown. In addition, the president's threatened military intervention and inflammatory rhetoric aimed at Chicago have not necessarily painted a ""wish you were here"" picture postcard image for the city. International tourism to Chicago was down 3.0% year-over-year during the summer, but the increase of domestic visitation was up, boosted by the ""drive market"" - people within five hours of the city - including suburbanites booking downtown hotels for a weekend getaway, Reynolds said. ""We're seeing a much bigger demand from the drive market and regional market, so that's where we're putting a lot of attention,"" Reynolds said. ""You're going to be seeing a lot of Chicago marketing to those people."" In 2024, the city welcomed an estimated 55.3 million visitors, generating $20.6 billion in economic impact, according to Choose Chicago. The increase in summer hotel demand is a ""great indicator"" for the trajectory of tourism this year, Reynolds said. While there was no Taylor Swift concert or Democratic National Convention this summer, Chicago had a number of high-profile events that drew record visitors to the city, according to Choose Chicago. The four strongest hotel weekends were: 92,643 room nights driven by the Nike Tournament of Champions at McCormick Place and BLACKPINK at Soldier Field in July; 91,559 room nights over Labor Day weekend; 91,384 room nights during Pride Fest in June; and 91,049 room nights when Lollapalooza hit in early August. These were not only the four biggest hotel weekends of the summer, but the biggest of all time, according to Choose Chicago. ""Hotels throughout Chicago are encouraged by this momentum and look forward to continuing to welcome more visitors to our amazing city,"" Michael Jacobson, president and CEO of the Illinois Hotel & Lodging Association, said in a news release. ""But we cannot rest on recent successes, as our industry faces a host of challenges caused by rising costs and ongoing economic uncertainty. One event that didn't make the top four list was the third and potentially final NASCAR Chicago Street Race over July Fourth weekend. An economic impact study from the race weekend is expected to be released by Choose Chicago this month. NASCAR has ""paused"" the event for next year and is headed instead for a San Diego street race, but has expressed interest in returning to Chicago on a different weekend in 2027. Topping pre-pandemic hotel occupancy and revenue over the summer is a source of both revenue and civic pride for Chicago, Reynolds said. The latter may be especially important in the face of relentless criticism from the Trump administration, which has stepped up its ICE enforcement actions in the city and threatened increased military presence to combat violent crime, despite a 29% reduction in murders through September, according to Chicago Police Department data. Last month, Trump seemed to declare war on Chicago in a social media post branded ""Chipocalypse Now,"" which showed helicopters flying past the city's skyline ablaze.

"United Airlines gets additional gates at O'Hare, while American loses a few: 'Competition keeps fares lower'","Beginning Wednesday, United Airlines will operate out of five additional gates at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. American Airlines will lose four. The shift in gates is the result of a ""use it or lose it"" provision in a lease agreement the airlines signed with the city in 2018. Under the agreement, gates at the airport are reallocated based on an airline's flying frequency the previous year. For weeks, the airlines have been engaged in a legal tug-of-war over the gates, with American filing suit against its rival airline and the city of Chicago, alleging that the reallocation process was initiated too early. But last week, a Cook County judge sided with the city, and the gate reshuffling is moving forward. Air travelers likely won't notice the gate shuffle, experts said. But the turf war speaks to the fierce competition for gate space at O'Hare, which is in the unusual position of serving as a dual hub for two major airlines. Experts say that competition between United, the largest carrier at O'Hare, and American, the second-largest, is ultimately good for travelers. ""Competition keeps fares lower, that's the bottom line,"" said airline expert Brett Snyder, president of the industry website Cranky Flier. The city maintains that the gate reallocation is designed to promote healthy competition. ""It incentivizes airlines to optimize their use of gates at O'Hare. This results in more flight options for passengers, including increased destinations, and lower fares,"" attorneys for the city wrote in a pre-hearing brief for the case. ""Increased travelers to O'Hare translates into increased revenue and economic activity for the City and the broader Chicago region."" ""An empty gate is not doing anything for the consumer,"" said Mark Weithofer, United's director of domestic network planning. ""It's not getting them to LaGuardia, it's not getting them to Florida, it's not getting them to London."" O'Hare set an all-time passenger record in July, when it saw more than 8 million air travelers pass through its gates, according to the city's Aviation Department. And construction on the first phase of a massive overhaul at the airport -- first negotiated by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2018 -- finally got underway this summer. The planned $8.2 billion revamp was the subject of contentious negotiations between United, American and the city at the time, and has been threatened by ballooning construction costs and schedule delays. The lease agreement that American alleged the city violated was signed as part of that 2018 agreement. Going forward, the gates are liable to ping-pong back and forth between the airlines each year, experts said. American will likely gain gates in the next reallocation, said Snyder -- who briefly worked for United in the mid-2000s -- because they've added plenty of flights out of O'Hare this year. United recovered at O'Hare more quickly coming out of the pandemic, while American said it was focusing on hubs in the southeast. But American has added a significant number of new flights this year from O'Hare to destinations including Bismarck, North Dakota; Boise, Idaho; Spokane, Washington, Cape Cod and Halifax, Naples and Madrid. In legal filings, the city suggested it also expected American to gain gates next year. American, for its part, has maintained that it is dedicated to maintaining a competitive presence in Chicago. American's senior vice president of network planning, Brian Znotins, said in a statement that the airline's growth ""is inherently beneficial for customers as it yields lower fares and more extensive flight schedules."" ""It's an important business market and we recently put a focus on premium leisure destinations,"" Znotins said. ""Hubs operate like 'connection factories,' which give local customers more service than the population would usually warrant alone."" American said it disagreed with last week's ruling and ""intend(s) to continue to pursue our claims."" United, meanwhile, says the new gates will allow it to double down on service at O'Hare. Weithofer said the new gates are allowing the airline to operate more than 2,000 extra flights throughout October and November. ""Having these gates allows us to build critical mass at Chicago,"" Weithofer said. The city's Aviation Department declined to make a representative available for an interview. But in a statement, spokesperson Kevin Bargnes reiterated the city's position that the reallocation process supports competition. ""Ensuring that gates are allocated effectively is essential to keeping O'Hare competitive, fostering growth and providing travelers with more choices and better service,"" he said. Snyder agreed that ""use it or lose it"" provisions are pro-capacity, in the sense that they encourage the departure of as many flights as possible out of an airport. But that doesn't necessarily mean the provision is pro-competition, he added: The provisions don't necessarily guarantee that one airline or another, such as United, won't continue to gain a larger and larger market share at the airport. ""Everyone would like American to keep being the sacrificial lamb to prevent United from dominating Chicago on its own,"" he said.",Chicago Tribune,2025-09-30T17:21:26Z,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/01/united-airlines-gets-additional-gates-at-ohare-while-american-loses-a-few-competition-keeps-fares-lower/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.311944,0.09019607843137245
Hampshire procuring for £100M transport and infrastructure consultancy framework | New Civil Engineer,"Hampshire County Council (HCC) has issued a tender notice to establish a new four-year multi-supplier consultancy framework for transport, highways and infrastructure services. The framework is designed to replace its existing Place, Connectivity & Infrastructure Professional Services Framework, which started in 2022 and runs to 2026 with suppliers including the likes of Jacobs, WSP and Stantec. The new framework is estimated to be worth up to £100M excluding VAT (£120M including VAT), underscoring the council's commitment to developing and maintaining critical infrastructure across the region. The new framework, which is scheduled to run from 2 March 2026 until 28 February 2030, aims to deliver specialist technical transportation and civil engineering professional services, alongside infrastructure development and support. It will be structured around nine distinct lots, divided into two main categories: Lot A, which covers large-scale multi-disciplinary consultancy services, and Lot B, comprising eight smaller specialist consultancy service lots. Tenderers are permitted to bid for either Lot A or one or more of the Lot B specialisms, but not both. The full breakdown of the Lots is below. HCC emphasises that while it will retain the role of lead Contracting Authority, the framework will be accessible to all public bodies within England - predominantly local authorities, NHS trusts, fire and police services and schools in the South East and South West regions. Participating authorities will operate under a Participating Authorities Agreement, ensuring clear governance and liability provisions. This NEC4 Framework Contract will utilise NEC4 Professional Service Contract (PSC) and Professional Service Short Contract (PSSC) call-offs, enabling streamlined procurement and contract management. The council's framework team of engineering consultancy will centrally handle all aspects of contract administration, including service requests, orders, call-offs, issue resolution and payments. Lot A, with an estimated value of £80M excluding VAT (£96M including VAT), will accommodate up to three large multi-disciplinary engineering consultancies. Services include sustainable and accessible transport infrastructure planning, highways and structural engineering design, construction estimating, safety audits, flood and water management, environmental and ecological services, landscape architecture, intelligent traffic systems and Building Information Modelling (BIM). The eight specialist lots within Lot B, each valued at around £2.5M excluding VAT (£3M including VAT), cover focused areas such as engineering design specialisms (bridge and structural inspections, drainage, visualisations), transport planning (active travel, future mobility, travel data modelling), strategic planning, environmental and sustainability services, ecological and arboriculture consultancy, community engagement for active travel, traffic management and parking consultancy and street lighting design. The council has stipulated strict tender deadlines with the enquiry period closing at 5pm on 20 October 2025 and tenders to be submitted by 2pm on 29 October 2025. Tenderers seeking to contribute to the public infrastructure goals of Hampshire and neighbouring counties are expected to demonstrate expertise aligned with the technical and strategic requirements outlined in the tender documents. This ambitious procurement reflects HCC's drive to enhance transport connectivity, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure resilience across the region, positioning it as a vital public client in the UK's evolving infrastructure landscape.

"Alright, alright, alright: Matthew McConaughey, wife Camila named godparents of Florida-bound Star Princess","Saving humanity in a film about interstellar travel is a decent film to have on one's resume to take on the godparent duties for a cruise ship named Star Princess. Princess Cruises announced Matthew McConaughey and his wife Camila will play a ceremonial role for its new ship that will be arriving to Fort Lauderdale in November for its first season sailing the Caribbean. In addition to 2014's ""Interstellar,"" McConaughey's film credits also include space-themed ""Contact,"" and he has more seafaring experience from 2000's ""U-571"" and 2005's ""Sahara."" So thematically he's a good fit for the sister ship to Sun Princess that debuted out of Port Everglades in 2024. Both are in the Sphere class for Princess Cruises, the largest vessels in their fleet. The duo are expected to be on hand for the ship's christening ceremony at the South Florida port on Nov. 6 and will begin regular seven-night Caribbean itineraries starting Nov. 10. ""We're honored to be godparents of the Star Princess,"" the pair said in a press release statement. ""With Princess, it's not just a vacation -- it's time well spent, families and friends coming together, meeting new folks, and making memories. This ship's got that spirit built right in, and we're proud to be part of her story from the beginning."" The two are cofounders of Pantalones Organic Tequila, with which Princess has a partnership. Fleetwide, Princess uses the tequila brand in signature cocktails including the 24K Gold Margarita, which the line called a fan favorite. Princess Cruises President Gus Antorcha said the pair's charisma is a good match for the godparent role. ""With their signature warmth and spirit, Camila and Matthew embody the values that define Princess, and we are delighted to welcome them into our family in such a meaningful way,"" he stated in the release. Camila McConaughey is also a best-selling author, entrepreneur and founder of online community Women of Today. Matthew McConaughey won an Oscar for 2013's ""Dallas Buyers Club"", with other film and TV credits including ""A Time to Kill,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" ""Magic Mike,"" ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" and ""True Detective."" The title of romantic comedy ""Failure to Launch,"" though, would conceivably not apply to his new cruise ship title. The cruise line took possession of the 177,800-ton, 4,300-guest vessel at a ceremony last Friday during a ceremony at the Fincantieri Shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. It became the 17th ship in the Princess fleet. The vessel will make its debut in the Mediterranean beginning Oct. 4 before sailing to Florida on a transatlantic crossing at the end of the month. After its winter Caribbean season, the ship will venture to Alaska through the Panama Canal. ""This remarkable vessel is a testament to the innovation and craftsmanship of our long-standing partners at Fincantieri, and we extend our heartfelt thanks to the shipbuilding team for bringing our newest ship to life,"" Antorcha said. Just like Sun Princess, the ship is fueled by liquefied natural gas, a cleaner-burning propulsion that's part of the cruise industry's efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The new vessel will have an expanded nonsmoking casino area, more seats in its Irish pub and a larger version of the new art-inspired dining venue Love by Britto. The architectural debuts on Sun Princess are mirrored on the new ship, including the spherical atrium called The Piazza that juts out on both sides of the ship's hull, the transforming theater space called The Arena and a top-deck, glass entertainment venue called The Dome. It will have 30 dining and drink venues, including a new version of the magic-themed speakeasy Spellbound by Magic Castle. Original stage productions coming on board include one titled ""Meridian,"" which has a Titanic-esque forbidden love story, and another circus-themed one titled ""Illuminate: A Spectacle of Joy."" Unlike Sun Princess, which was originally planned to have a hang-glider attraction, although that fell through, Star Princess is taking that same space for a dedicated sports court and track, along with a splash pad. The ship is one of several with Florida debuts out of Port Everglades planned this fall, including Disney's third Wish-class ship, Disney Destiny and Celebrity Cruises' fifth Edge-class ship, Celebrity Xcel.",SunSentinel,2025-10-01T06:01:13Z,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/10/01/camila-and-matthew-mcconaughey-named-godparents-of-florida-bound-star-princess/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.313072,0.3725490196078431
An RV park in this neighborhood? Not without a fight,"The project remains stalled in litigation and battles over permits, environmental reviews and safety standards. John Montagna is ready to move into a new RV park in the Green Meadows West section of Harbor City, near his job as a longshoreman. But he is still making a two-hour commute from Bakersfield, after opposition from neighbors helped stall the opening of the park. ""Save Green Meadows West"" signs have popped up on many lawns as residents express fears about crime and declining property values, while people like Montagna say the park, called Ocean's 11, offers an affordable option amid the area's sky-high rents. ""There's people that live nice in RVs,"" said Montagna, who plans to pay $1,250 a month to live at the park in his 2021 Tiffin Allegro Bus. ""Anybody who moves into any neighborhood can be a safety issue. You can't be stereotyping just 'cause it's an RV park."" Nicole Paulsen, who lives on President Avenue about a block from the proposed RV park, worries about a ""Breaking Bad"" scenario of drugs and violence, noting issues with RVs illegally parked nearby on Western Avenue. She said the RV park's developer has not adequately included neighbors in the planning process. ""It's not going to be our neighborhood anymore,"" said Paulsen, who grew up in San Pedro and moved to Green Meadows West in 2019 after having her second child. Still, Paulsen acknowledged that many of the people who eventually move in will probably be law-abiding. She stressed that some of her opposition comes out of fear that the RV park's residents, who she said will be ""packed in like sardines,"" won't be safe themselves. Jerry Long, who has lived across from the property for 13 years, said he would prefer a residential development over an RV park, which he said will be too high-density. ""It doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood,"" he said. ""This was zoned for single-family."" For more than a year, Ocean's 11 has been mired in litigation and procedural roadblocks, including a measure authored by Councilmember Tim McOsker and approved by the full City Council that requires an environmental analysis of the nine defunct oil wells on the property. For now, the RV park sits nearly empty, with only a security guard living there. Stewart Silver, an entrepreneur who started Avon Rent-A-Car and owned an Anaheim professional roller hockey team, purchased the 1.2-acre parcel near the southern tip of Los Angeles for $1.6 million in 2023. He has opened four other RV parks and still operates two in Santa Clarita and North Hills. He said he spent more than half a million dollars prepping and building the Ocean's 11 site. He then began offering the lots, which have water, power and sewer hookups as well as space to park a car and create a small yard, to prospective tenants. Silver used a city process available to RV parks, which allows them to be designated as a ""public benefit project"" if they meet 12 standards, including noise regulations and graffiti removal. These projects are not required to be debated in public hearings. But then, residents caught wind of the project. Many have lived in the neighborhood, with its neat lawns and single-family homes, for decades. A three-bedroom, two-bathroom house on President Avenue was recently advertised for $799,000 on Zillow. Last June, Paulsen started a GoFundMe, quickly raising more than $30,000 for legal representation to fight the RV park. ""We are uniting to express our concerns about the proposed construction of this RV park which will harm the safety of our quiet neighborhood, overcrowd our area with traffic, and negatively affect the privacy and property values of neighboring residents of this RV park,"" neighbors wrote on their website, ""Save Green Meadows West."" ""I followed all the rules. We're going to be good neighbors. These are communities that I build,"" Silver said. ""The people we cater to at these things are ... everyday people, salt of the earth people."" Silver has promised that the RV park will be staffed with a security guard 24-7. Dana Goller, a security guard who already lives on the property with his wife, said the park will make the neighborhood more safe, not less safe. ""Everybody moving here is people just like them,"" he said. ""They work. They live. They pay bills. ... What Stewart's opening here is a blessing, not a sin. This is not a homeless camp."" McOsker, who represents the area, said he heard from locals like Paulsen who were concerned about the RV park. In his motion requiring the environmental analysis of the oil wells, McCosker cited alleged issues -- from missing children to assaults with a deadly weapon -- at other RV parks Silver has operated. ""The operator has demonstrated several public health and safety failures ... and the potential for this type of nuisance activity to occur in Harbor City and impact public safety should be taken into consideration,"" McOsker wrote in the motion. Silver said that he sold an RV park in Wilmington nearly five years ago and that there was ""no crime"" when he ran it. In an interview, McOsker said he was horrified by the conditions at the Wilmington site, including narrow driving lanes, food for sale outdoors and washers and dryers connected with extension cords. He feared Silver might soon sell the Ocean's 11 property, which could allow it to similarly deteriorate. ""It looked like a very dangerous encampment,"" McOsker said of the Wilmington RV park. After the City Council passed McOsker's motion in June 2024, the Department of Building and Safety closed the project's permits, effectively putting it on hold. McOsker and neighbors say that Silver has not built his park up to the 12 standards required for public benefit projects, though city agencies have signed off on the project multiple times. McOsker said he also believes the project needs a conditional use permit, which would require public hearings and a more formalized process. ""This is not about stopping anything. This is about requiring a safe and inhabitable property,"" he said. ""It's about applying our code fairly, where we are protecting health and safety of the residents at the property."" A conditional use permit could codify requirements for Silver and subsequent owners, McOsker said, such as spacing the RVs to allow emergency vehicles to easily maneuver. Silver said McOsker's measures were ""thinly veiled"" political efforts to stop Ocean's 11 from operating in his district. Some advocates for more affordable housing agreed with Silver. ""It's disappointing when City Council members continue to disrupt affordable housing, and Councilmember McOsker is certainly trying to use procedure and political moves to do so with this [conditional use permit] process,"" said Zachary Pitts, the Los Angeles director of YIMBY Action. Last July, after McOsker's motion requiring the environmental review passed, Silver sued the city. Last month, a judge ruled largely in Silver's favor, saying the city must issue the permits it has been withholding. McOsker's argument that the project needs a conditional use permit ""conflicts with the city's own long-standing, consistent interpretation"" that an RV park needs only to meet the 12 standards to qualify as a public benefit project, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Alison Mackenzie wrote. The city attorney's office declined to comment on the case or whether it plans to appeal. McOsker is fighting back with more legislation. Last month, the council approved his motion for city staff to draft an interim ordinance that would prohibit the issuing of permits for RV parks built as public benefit projects. The ordinance, when it is published, will be in effect for 45 days and can be extended for months as the city works to adopt new land use rules. It's not clear whether the ordinance would affect Ocean's 11. McOsker's office said the RV park's permitting will ""be most likely resolved through judicial and administrative determinations both at the court and at the city."" Silver believes the judge's ruling entitles him to permits.

Wild horses held at Colorado prison complex to be shipped out of state as 30-year training program ends,"The journalist and/or newsroom have/has a deep knowledge of the topic, location or community group covered in this article. For 30 years, thousands of wild horses captured in federal roundups have ended up in corrals at a state prison complex in Cañon City, where they were cared for and trained by inmates through a program that prepared horses for adoption and provided work experience for people returning to life after incarceration. But the program is ending. Citing escalating costs, the federal Bureau of Land Management has not renewed its contract with the Colorado Department of Corrections for the mustang program. The 2,073 horses at the prison complex will go to holding facilities in Wyoming or Utah, minus about 100 animals that were captured in Colorado. The Colorado mustangs will go up for adoption, as federal land managers try to find them homes within the state where they have always lived. Following the end of the program in November, mustangs rounded up in future helicopter or bait-and-trap operations on Colorado rangeland will be hauled to other states. The closure of the Colorado program comes as the BLM shuts down another wild horse and burro holding center in Ewing, Illinois. American Wild Horse Conservation said both closures were bad news, exposing ""deep cracks in the BLM's broken roundup-and-warehousing system."" Mustangs trained by Colorado prisoners were more adoptable and far less likely to enter the slaughter pipeline, the organization said. ""There are now more wild horses warehoused in government holding facilities than living free on the range,"" said Suzanne Roy, executive director of American Wild Horse Conservation. ""That's a shocking indictment of a system that simply doesn't work."" There are more than 53,000 wild horses and 19,000 burros living on public lands across the West, compared with about 61,000 wild horses and 3,100 burros in government holding pens, according to BLM data. The prison program led to many horses finding ""great forever homes,"" Friends of the Mustangs president George Brauneis said via email. He said he looked forward to his volunteer group working with state and federal agencies on other wild horse programs that would make ""Colorado a model for the nation."" The state has a wild horse task force that has discussed a new horse sanctuary and pushed for new funding for fertility control operations. BLM officials said ""rising costs"" were to blame for the end of the program. Officials at the BLM and the state Department of Corrections had not provided information about the cost of the program by Wednesday morning. The prison complex was the site of one of the worst public relations disasters in the federal wild horse management program when, in 2022, 145 mustangs died of equine flu. An investigation determined that the horses, accustomed to living in the wild and not in close quarters, were not vaccinated within federal timelines, which are targeted for 30 days after capture. Veterinarians also suspected that the horses' exposure to wildfire smoke before their capture might have made them more susceptible to flu. The horse pens at the south central Colorado prison grounds encompass about 120 acres. The Wet Mountains rise in the distance, and the horse facility, deep inside the complex surrounded by razor wire, is not easily visible from the highway. The pens have held horses from the Sand Wash Basin near the Wyoming border, as well as herds from West Douglas and the Piceance-East Douglas near Meeker. About 30 people incarcerated in the prison work in the pens, feeding, watering and shoeing the horses, and to break and train the horses so they are ready for adoption. Men incarcerated at the prison who were previously interviewed by The Colorado Sun said they would arrive at the barn each day at 7 a.m. in their green prison jumpsuits, then put on cowboy boots and hats. The job is popular at the prison complex, which also allows inmates to farm. The horse facility, once with only about 200 mustangs, grew to hold more than 2,000 from Colorado and other states as the BLM ramped up roundup operations. The federal agency has removed more than 2,200 wild horses from Colorado rangeland since 2021, leaving about 1,200 on public lands in the state. The horses in the holding pens will be transferred to Axtell, Utah, and Wheatland, Wyoming, BLM spokesman Steven Hall said. The goal is to find permanent homes for the 100 Colorado horses ""before they would need to be transferred,"" he said. The Colorado Department of Corrections would not give interviews about the end of the program, but in a news release said that it has ""provided unique vocational and rehabilitative skills to the incarcerated population while supporting the BLM's mission to manage and protect wild horses and burros."" ""We are saddened by the discontinuation of this successful partnership and impactful program,"" Andre Stancil, CDOC executive director, said in a news release. ""The Colorado Department of Corrections is immensely proud of the legacy of this program and the positive impact it has had on participants, staff, and the community."" The contract expired at the end of September, but federal and state officials agreed to a 60-day extension in order to allow time to move the horses. The five state employees who were operating the horse prison program, as well as the 30 incarcerated workers, will be assigned to other roles, state officials said. Officials did not provide details about when the 100 Colorado horses would go up for adoption. In March, a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the BLM's horse adoption incentive program violated federal law and likely was leading to the slaughter of horses. The now-discontinued program had paid $1,000 to people who adopted wild horses and burros. Horse advocacy groups, including the American Wild Horse Conservation, argued that the incentive payment contributed to the likelihood that horses would end up in slaughterhouses, which is illegal. The ""easy money"" of the payments could lead to abuse of the program, Judge William J. Martínez ruled.",The Colorado Sun,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://coloradosun.com/2025/10/01/wild-horses-canon-city-prison-program-closure/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.314583,-0.1764705882352942

Maria Azatyan on Building Investor Ready Finance for AI and SpaceTech Startups,"Maria Azatyan is a CFO and venture advisor with more than twenty years in finance, investments, management accounting, and strategic consulting. She has guided AI, SpaceTech, Robotics, and Data Science startups through modeling, reporting, and investment preparation, and she founded Maro Academy, an education platform for international certifications including CFA, CPA, EA, and BAR. Her methodology for financial modeling and for detecting risk and fraud in DeepTech and AI startups has been adopted by early-stage teams and investors, and she has contributed to the financial transformation of R&D organizations, including a 2022 project at Alango Armenia that returned the business to profitability above a 65% margin. She participates in SelectUSA Summit and other international forums, advises accelerators and funds, and writes actively on LinkedIn about the new space economy, AI, and startup finance. These outstanding achievements and a record of practical results underpin a profile often described by peers as evidence of extraordinary abilities in startup finance and strategy. You have 20+ years across finance, investments, management accounting, and strategic consulting. What parts of that experience became the foundation for your work with DeepTech and AI startups today? [MA]: The first layer is discipline: management accounting that actually explains operations rather than just categorizes costs. I learned to connect line items to behavior -- how engineering sprints drive expenses, how customer behavior shows up in deferred revenue, how seasonality distorts cohort views. The second layer is investment logic. I spent years translating messy narratives into capital-ready stories: risk, return, timing, and milestones. That made me comfortable designing models that investors can interrogate in five minutes and founders can update in ten. The third is consulting structure. Early DeepTech companies don't need theatrics; they need a clear path: data hygiene, unit economics by segment, and scenario analysis that survives stress. When those three layers meet -- discipline, capital logic, structure -- the numbers stop being slides and start steering product, hiring, and go-to-market. That's where my work lives now. Your portfolio includes AI, SpaceTech, Robotics, and Data Science startups. How does your modeling approach adapt when the technology has long R&D cycles or uncertain revenue timing, as in SpaceTech? [MA]: I separate physics from finance -- but I link them. In SpaceTech, timing dominates. So I map technical milestones to cash events before I ever forecast revenue. Grants, payload integration windows, regulatory reviews -- each becomes a dated assumption that drives burn and capital needs. Then I build unit economics at the level that matters: mission segment, customer type, or payload class. I don't smooth uncertainty; I show it. The model exposes how a six-month slip in a test campaign changes break-even, how a different launch provider shifts gross margin after logistics, and how grant tranches cushion risk. Founders see the levers they can actually pull -- scope, cadence, or pricing. Investors see that uncertainty is priced in, not hidden. That honesty shortens diligence because everyone can challenge assumptions in one place and watch scenarios cascade through the model. You founded Maro Academy to prepare professionals for certifications like CFA, CPA, EA, and BAR. What did you learn from building an education platform that you now apply to finance leadership in startups? [MA]: Curriculum design taught me to be ruthless about prerequisites. In education, if the base concept is shaky, every advanced topic collapses. Startups are identical. Before growth dashboards, I align on definitions -- revenue recognition rules, cohort cuts, cost allocation -- so we stop arguing about the dictionary. The second lesson is pacing. Learners progress by feedback loops; founders do too. I embed tiny wins into the finance roadmap: one-sheet income statements, a clean cap table, then an 18-month cash forecast. Each win buys trust for the next level of sophistication. Third, assessment. In the Academy we measure outcomes, not just attendance. With teams, I check whether metrics change behavior. If ""retention by segment"" doesn't shift product or pricing, it's decoration. Education forced me to design for action, and that mindset keeps startup finance practical. Your methodology focuses on detecting financial risk and potential fraud in DeepTech and AI startups. What are the early signals you look for, and how do you operationalize that in fast-moving teams? [MA]: I start with reconciliation that's painful on purpose. One source of truth, one workbook of raw inputs and formulas, everything else derived. When numbers disagree, I don't average; I trace. Early signals: revenue booked without clear delivery evidence, capitalized R&D that grows faster than headcount, and vendor concentration that doesn't match procurement policy. In AI products, I watch inference costs versus pricing and whether experimentation runs get quietly expensed as ""marketing."" For operationalization, I use checklists and visual maps -- who can change a metric, who approves, what logs exist. Then I add anomaly flags: margin by acquisition channel, cohort decay patterns, and sudden shifts in recognition. Teams see the same dashboard investors see, and they can reproduce every number. That transparency deters bad behavior and surfaces honest mistakes before they become fundraising problems. In 2022 you led a financial transformation at Alango Armenia that returned the operation to profitability with margin above 65%. What were the concrete levers that moved the number? [MA]: Three levers. First, cost architecture. We re-segmented costs by product line and function, which exposed under-priced services and a support load that didn't belong to R&D. Second, revenue quality. We adjusted contracts to align delivery, acceptance, and billing -- no more cash without clarity. That stabilized gross margin because we stopped masking work-in-progress as revenue. Third, incentive alignment. Engineers received targets tied to release readiness and defect rates, not just sprint velocity, so we cut rework. The comp plan recognized the cost of delays in terms the team respected. None of this was glamorous. It was persistent cleanup, weekly visibility, and one data model everyone trusted. Once the structure held, efficiency lifted naturally. Profitability wasn't a surprise; it was the result of a system that made good decisions easier. You frequently advise accelerators and funds on growth, strategy, and investment readiness. When a startup asks for a pre-diligence checklist, what do you insist on completing before they contact investors? [MA]: I avoid encyclopedias; I insist on essentials that change outcomes. First, a clean cap table with clarity on vesting and any side letters. Second, an 18-month integrated model -- P&L, cash flow, hiring plan -- where investors can adjust three assumptions and see the effects instantly. Third, cohort-based retention by segment and by acquisition channel; averages hide risk. Fourth, documentation of revenue recognition and pricing logic. Finally, a short narrative that connects product milestones to capital needs and to measurable traction. I'll review legal hygiene and IP basics, but the heart is consistency: every artifact must tell the same story. When teams do this work, investor conversations move from interrogation to collaboration. Time compresses, and term sheets arrive from people who already understand the engine they're financing. You participate in SelectUSA Summit and similar international events. How do those forums actually influence your day-to-day work with founders? [MA]: They compress networks and reality-check assumptions. At those events I test pricing, compare regulatory timelines, and learn what metrics are resonating with current capital. That becomes a calibration layer in models. If U.S. customers are paying a premium for reliability over raw performance in a niche robotics segment, I'll reflect that in the value narrative and in discounts. If grant dynamics shift, I'll change the order of milestones to unlock tranches earlier. And relationships matter. When a founder can point to a warm conversation with a potential partner or an agency contact, I can anchor timelines in more than hope. Those forums don't replace execution, but they sharpen it. Founders leave with a narrower target and fewer illusions, which makes their next quarter more productive. Your academic background includes a Master's in Finance and Credit, an ongoing MBA comparing SpaceTech and traditional startup structures, and certificates from MIT on the New Space Economy and AI, plus an EY CFO certification. How do you translate academic rigor into startup speed? [MA]: Methodology first; jargon last. The MBA research forces me to define structure -- capital intensity, development gates, and commercialization cycles -- then test where classic startup playbooks fail. MIT's New Space Economy work gives me a taxonomy for business models that look similar on a slide but behave differently in cash flow. The EY CFO certification was a reminder that control environments exist to make decisions safer, not slower. I don't bring lectures to founders. I bring tools: evidence thresholds for launching a new SKU, a decision tree for build-versus-partner, and statistical guardrails for interpreting cohort noise. Academic discipline helps me choose the few metrics that matter for a given stage. Then we move fast inside that frame, because speed without design just recreates the same argument every month. You teach courses in international reporting and financial analytics. What recurring misunderstandings do you correct for technical founders? [MA]: Revenue recognition is the first. Founders often see ""invoice sent"" and assume ""revenue earned."" Under IFRS or U.S. GAAP, it depends on performance obligations, not enthusiasm. The second is capitalization. Capitalizing everything that looks like R&D feels efficient until amortization buries gross margin and misleads hiring plans. The third is cohort logic. You can't fix retention with averages; you fix it by understanding who comes back, why, and at what cost. I translate those topics with examples from their own data. When founders see how misclassification distorts runway or how churn in a single segment cancels paid growth, the conversation changes from debate to design. Teaching trains me to make standards practical, which is precisely what they need. Your LinkedIn writing shapes conversations around the new space economy, AI, and startup finance. What themes keep returning in your practice that you also emphasize publicly? [MA]: Three themes recur. First, transparency is a performance tool. When teams and investors can audit a number to its source in one step, behavior improves because excuses disappear. Second, channel economics matter as much as product economics. If paid acquisition produces half the margin of organic or partner channels, growth can bankrupt you with a smile. Third, retention is the quiet hero. I push founders to measure retention by segment and cohort age because it reveals whether product value compounds. On LinkedIn I'm not aiming for slogans. I'm trying to give founders prompts they can test this week. If a post helps a CFO cut a useless dashboard or forces a pricing experiment, it's done its job. Your work often includes mini-audits and stress testing before a round. How do you run those sprints without paralyzing a team that still needs to ship product? [MA]: I time-box and stage. Week one is data hygiene: we define sources, clean joins, and lock naming. Week two is the integrated model with three scenarios and a hiring spine. Week three is narrative and artifacts: a concise memo, the deck's financial skeleton, and a live dashboard investors can click. Shipping continues because I don't ask for perfect history; I ask for a trustworthy present. I'll mark gaps for follow-up instead of pausing releases. The secret is focus. Most fundraising pain comes from contradictions, not from missing a chart. When every artifact aligns, teams feel lighter. Investors feel respected. Product keeps moving. You are a member of AmCham Armenia and a participant in Feminno, a community of women in STEM. How have these communities influenced your leadership and mentoring style? [MA]: They keep me close to reality. AmCham connects finance conversations to policy, tax, and trade details that change the economics of expansion. Feminno puts me in rooms with women who build real technology under real constraints. I borrow their pragmatism. When I mentor, I avoid generalities and ask, ""What did you change last sprint? What would break if demand doubled?"" Communities remind me that leadership is logistics: removing friction, setting standards, and holding a calm line when things wobble. They also expand the pool of reference points for young professionals. Seeing peers with different paths reduces the pressure to perform a myth and encourages people to build competence. You receive letters of recommendation from AI partners, venture investors, the Ministry of Economy, the Armenian Association of Science, and civic leaders including a former Glendale mayor. What does external validation change inside a startup? [MA]: It accelerates trust, but it doesn't replace proof. For founders, credible references lower the cost of doubt. A fund partner's note won't fix retention, yet it can buy the extra meeting where we demonstrate improvement. For my role, those letters encode expectations: clear decisions, honest models, and responsiveness. Internally, they set a standard -- if we want external confidence, we must earn it weekly. I tell teams that validation is a door, not a guarantee. Once you're inside, performance speaks. Still, in fundraising, doors matter. When an investor hears that your finance lead is known for clean audits and explainable models, diligence starts on the front foot. You are building a financial platform that automates startup analysis and adds AI tools for risk and growth assessment. What problems will the first release solve for founders and investors? [MA]: Two problems: inconsistency and latency. Founders struggle to keep numbers coherent across spreadsheets, BI tools, and decks. Investors struggle to see what changed and why. The platform will unify sources, enforce definitions, and surface anomalies automatically. It will explain where a number comes from, what drives it, and what changed since last week. On the risk side, it flags mismatches: revenue recognized before delivery evidence, margins that diverge by channel, or cohort decay that contradicts stated retention. On growth, it tests scenarios -- pricing, hiring, go-to-market mix -- and shows the effect on runway and break-even. It's not replacing judgment; it's compressing the time from question to answer. The goal is a shared model that educates the team and satisfies an investor in the same session. Your publications span 2022 to 2024, including work on correlation between financial efficiency and technological innovation, early anomaly detection, scaling risk, explainable models in due diligence, contribution margin versus gross margin, inefficiency identification in IT and AI projects, and infrastructure cost optimization. Which idea from this research changed your practice the most? [MA]: Contribution margin by acquisition channel. It sounds technical; it changes behavior. Many teams celebrate blended gross margin and miss that paid channels can destroy contribution after variable costs unique to that channel. When we reframe around contribution, marketing plans shift, retention gets budget, and sales incentives stop rewarding unprofitable deals. The other shift is explainability. In diligence, an elegant model that no one understands slows everything. My research on explainable financial models pushed me to reduce hidden logic and expose assumptions. Investors don't need magic; they need clarity. That research gave me a checklist I now apply everywhere -- from naming conventions to how we present scenario deltas. You often help teams prepare for rounds from pre-seed to Series A. How do you know a startup is actually ready to raise? [MA]: I look for coherence. Growth that a founder can explain with data, retention that holds for the right segments, a CAC trend that doesn't spike with spend, and a cash runway of at least six months. The model must update fast and survive a skeptic's three edits. I also watch behavior in meetings: whether a CTO can walk an investor through unit economics without me, whether a CEO answers timing questions with dates not adjectives. Ready doesn't mean perfect; it means understandable and resilient. When those signals align, the round is worth the time -- for everyone involved. You consult on detecting financial violations in startups and design visual guides and checklists for teams. What makes a checklist effective in a culture that values speed? [MA]: It has to be visible, short, and tied to consequences. I use step-by-step flows embedded where work happens: inside the model, inside the CRM, inside procurement tools. Each step names the owner, the evidence, and the timestamp. If something blocks, the person clicking ""approve"" sees the risk they're accepting. Speed and compliance don't fight when the checklist is the fastest path to a clean decision. The moment a founder sees that fifteen minutes of structure prevents two weeks of rework or a failed audit, the checklist earns respect. That's the threshold I aim for. You are an active LinkedIn blogger. What advice do you give CFOs who want to contribute publicly without drifting into abstraction? [MA]: Write from cases, not concepts. Share one metric you misread last month and how you corrected it. Show a model screenshot -- anonymized -- and ask for feedback. Post the hiring plan logic you used and one thing you would change. Public writing is a lab for clarity. If your peers can't follow your assumption chain in a short post, investors won't follow it in diligence. The benefit isn't likes; it's sharper thinking. And when founders see practical work, they trust you faster. You often receive invitations to judge or sit on expert panels for competitions and accelerators. What do you look for in the first five minutes of a startup pitch? [MA]: Connection between technology and unit economics. If a team can describe the technical edge in one paragraph and immediately show how it changes retention, margin, or payback, I lean in. If they can't connect the two, we'll spend the meeting translating. I also listen for specificity -- dates, segments, constraints. Vague ambition is common; constraints are where strategies form. Finally, I watch how the team handles uncertainty. A founder who can say, ""Here's what we know, here's what we're testing next, here's how we'll decide,"" saves everyone time. Five minutes is enough to see whether a company is ready to be taught by the market. Many readers ask about career arcs. What moved you from corporate roles into startup work focused on AI and DeepTech? [MA]: Curiosity and accountability. In corporate settings I learned scale and rigor, but I missed the proximity to cause and effect. In startups, decisions show up in the numbers next month. I wanted that loop. AI and DeepTech attracted me because they force finance to learn technology, not observe it. You can't price inference without understanding architecture; you can't plan SpaceTech without respecting physics. The work is demanding and sometimes messy. That's part of the appeal. I like building systems that stand up when things shake. What would you tell a first-time founder who worries that finance will slow them down? [MA]: Finance slows you down only when it's ornamental. If the model explains decisions, it speeds you up because debates end faster. Start with a shared glossary, a single source of truth, and three scenarios. Update weekly. Use retention and contribution margin by channel as your early reality checks. Keep the deck simple and the data open. When finance serves the product and the customer, it becomes a lever, not a hurdle. That's what I try to build with every team.

EPA boss Burke to speak at Nuffield Ireland conference,"Director general of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Laura Burke will speak at this year's Nuffield Ireland conference, which will take place on 14 November at the Horse and Jockey Hotel. During the fireside chat, Burke is to share reflections on her leadership journey and the importance of progress through collaboration - insights that resonate deeply with the Nuffield ethos, the organisation said. This event will bring together scholars, alumni, industry leaders, policymakers and stakeholders to engage in meaningful dialogue. Nuffield Ireland chair Joe Leonard said his year's conference theme, 'Cultivating Opportunities from Obstacles', ""reflects the resilience, innovation and leadership that define the Nuffield scholar community"". ""It also speaks directly to the heart of what Nuffield is about - turning challenges into leadership opportunities. Our scholars have travelled the world to bring back insights that will help shape the future of Irish agriculture. ""Our annual conference is open to all who have an interest in the future of agriculture and food, not just Nuffield alumni and stakeholders. We're proud to host this event and invite everyone with a stake in farming, food and rural development to join the conversation,"" he added. A central part of the conference will be the presentations from the five 2024 Nuffield Ireland scholars, each sharing findings from their international research on topics critical to the future of Irish agriculture and rural development. The full list of scholars and their topics is listed below. John's research explores the complex challenge of bovine tuberculosis eradication in Ireland. He highlights the need for reform in wildlife control, investment in technologies such as whole genome sequencing and adoption of international best practices in biosecurity and cattle movement. His work calls for a renewed national commitment to finally eliminate bTB after 70 years of effort. Nick's study addresses the growing threat of anthelmintic resistance in Irish sheep farming. Drawing on global case studies, he proposes six practical and future-proof rules for parasite control, aiming to improve profitability, animal welfare and environmental outcomes. His recommendations include breeding for tolerance, feeding for immunity and creating national standards for faecal egg count testing. Niall Hurson, agricultural policy adviser, Kingdom of the Netherlands, Monaghan Topic: who tells the story of farming best - and why does it matter? Niall's report investigates how agriculture's public narrative is shaped and why farmers must reclaim their voice. He explores the fragmentation of political representation, the fragility of public trust and the need for authentic, farmer-led communication. His recommendations span education, policy reform and strategic global engagement to ensure Irish farming remains relevant and respected. Molly Garvey, food facilitator and communications consultant, Wicklow Topic: unlocking Ireland's agri-food edge through strategic collaboration Molly's research examines the barriers to collaboration between agriculture and environmental sectors in Ireland. She identifies cultural silos, generational gaps and policy fragmentation as key challenges. Her report offers actionable routes to productive dialogue, including joint platforms, local pilot projects and cross-sectoral education, to help Ireland lead in sustainable land use and food production. Michael Martin, beef and tillage farmer, Wexford Topic: from field to fork: ensuring the sustainability and competitiveness of Irish beef in an era of globalisation Michael's study explores Ireland's position in the global beef market. He highlights strategic advantages, such as EU access and strong social licence, while addressing challenges like dairy-origin beef quality and consumer price sensitivity. His recommendations include a beef finishing bonus, improved marketing and better integration of dairy and beef systems to secure Ireland's role as a sustainable beef leader.",Irish Farmers Journal Interactive,2025-10-01T10:05:43Z,https://www.farmersjournal.ie/news/news/epa-boss-burke-to-speak-at-nuffield-ireland-conference-887520,2025-10-01 18:30:20.316905,0.4588235294117646
New electronic digital signature rules in Kazakhstan,"Effective June 28, 2025, electronic digital signature (EDS) keys in Kazakhstan can only be obtained in person. From that date onward, EDS keys can no longer be issued via proxy. For businesses, this means that to obtain an EDS, a director of a legal entity will need to submit the relevant application, as well as undergo in-person biometric identification or photo capture. Previously, a representative acting on the basis of a power of attorney issued by the legal entity could obtain an EDS on the director's behalf. This change is particularly significant for companies whose directors are foreign nationals, as legal entities must now ensure the director is physically present not only for obtaining an Individual Identification Number (IIN) but also for the EDS process. It is also important to note that from March 13, 2025, an administrative liability (fine) was introduced for using another person's EDS. This is particularly relevant, as many companies commonly follow the practice of having employees (for instance, for accountants processing payments) use the director's EDS. However, such employees can use their own EDS for these purposes, as there is also a possibility for employees to obtain an EDS (acting under a power of attorney or an order) with signature rights on behalf of the legal entity. Issuance of such ""secondary"" EDS require the director's prior approval via their EDS. The above changes seem aimed to enhance security and prevent unauthorized use of EDS credentials.",dentons.com,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/october/1/new-electronic-digital-signature-rules-in-kazakhstan,2025-10-01 18:30:20.317038,0.2078431372549019

Tampa Bay Rays officially sold to new ownership group,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- It's official: The Tampa Bay Rays belong to a new ownership group. The team confirmed the news Tuesday afternoon. An ownership group led by Florida-based business executive Patrick Zalupski has closed on the purchase of the Rays. The team didn't release the purchase price, but reports have estimated it at $1.7 billion. That is about $500 million more than Forbes valued the team at when the 2025 season started. Major League Baseball owners approved the deal last week. ""It's an incredible honor to become the stewards of the Tampa Bay Rays, a franchise with a proud history and a bright future,"" said Zalupski. ""We are especially privileged to have been chosen by Stu Sternberg as his successors, and we're all energized by the responsibility to serve Rays fans everywhere and this great game."" Zalupski is the founder and CEO of Jacksonville-based home builder, Dream Finders Homes Inc. Zalupski will be joined at the executive level of his ownership group by: - Bill Cosgrove, CEO of Ohio-based Union Home Mortgage, longtime title sponsor of the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl in Tampa. - Ken Babby, founder and CEO of Fast Forward Sports Group, which owns the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, the AAA-affiliate of the Miami Marlins, and the Akron RubberDucks, the AA-affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians. The team has updated the front office portion of its website. ""I want to sincerely thank Commissioner Rob Manfred and the entire Major League Baseball community for their trust and support throughout this process, Zalupski said. ""We will work hard to earn the respect and confidence of our fans and new MLB partners, and we are excited about the upcoming challenge to deliver a world-class experience on and off the field."" Zalupski will serve as MLB control person (generally considered the owner with the largest stake of the team) and co-chair for the Tampa Bay Rays. Cosgrove will also serve as co-chair, while Babby is the chief executive officer and will oversee day-to-day business operations of the club. Erik Neander, the Rays' top-ranking baseball official currently in his 19th year of service to the Rays, will continue in his role as President of Baseball Operations. It was announced earlier this month that Matt Silverman, one of the team presidents, was leaving his role with the team. The Rays completed the 2025 season with a 77-85 record, missing the postseason for a second consecutive year. The team has reached two World Series -- 2008 and 2020. The Rays debuted in 1998. As part of the transaction, the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a USL Championship league team, has also been acquired.",News 13,2025-10-01T10:05:30Z,https://mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2025/09/30/tampa-bay-rays-officially-sold-to-new-ownership-group,2025-10-01 18:30:20.317366,0.2941176470588236
Understanding the 1-1-1 rule,"All corporate lawyers in Kazakhstan are well familiar with the so-called ""1-1-1"" rule, which prohibits a Kazakhstani LLP from having as its sole participant another business partnership that itself consist of one person. In essence, the structure ""any person → business partnership → LLP"" is not allowed. Despite this rule being in place for over a decade, its practical application remains subject to interpretation and debate. One recurring question is whether the rule applies if the sole participant is a foreign legal entity with one shareholder. The clarifications provided by state authorities on the matter are quite contradictory. According to the most recent applicable position of the Ministry of Justice (please note that this dates from 2013), foreign legal entities are subject to the restriction. This approach was not in line with the ministry's earlier position in 2010, wherein it stated that the restriction does not apply to foreign companies. In order to determine what constitutes a ""business partnership"" in relation to a foreign legal entity, the state authorities refer to the Kazakh definition of a partnership as ""a commercial organization with charter capital divided into participatory interests (contributions) of its founders (participants)."" However, the authorities' clarifications do not elaborate on what exactly is meant by ""participatory interests/contributions"" in the context of foreign legal forms. For example, the shares of a typical SARL or B.V. may, in substance, be treated as participatory interests -- and the issue here may lie not in the translation, but in the characteristics of the rights attached to ownership in a private company. Another gray area concerns AIFC (Astana International Financial Centre) private companies with a sole shareholder. Can they incorporate a Kazakhstani LLP? On the one hand, the restriction should not apply because even though AIFC companies are registered in Kazakhstan, they are not organized as partnerships under Kazakh civil law. They are incorporated under the AIFC Companies Regulations, based on English common law principles and are typically classified as private companies limited by shares, which are legally distinct from partnerships. On the other hand, if an AIFC company is considered as a foreign entity, then according to the Ministry of Justice's 2013 interpretation, it cannot act as the sole founder of an LLP. In any case, due to the ambiguity and risk of delays or refusal during registration or re-registration, many choose a practical workaround like adding a minor (ex. 0.1%) shareholder either in the LLP itself or in the shareholder chain. Given how easily the rule can be bypassed in practice, it raises a valid question as to whether the restriction still serves a meaningful purpose. Something to think about: from August 1 this year, the ""1:1:1 rule"" has been officially abolished in Russia.",dentons.com,2025-10-01T00:00:00Z,https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/october/1/understanding-the-1-1-1-rule,2025-10-01 18:30:20.317599,0.0980392156862746
Exploring the Impact of 3D Configurators on Furniture Manufacturing,"Over the past few years, digital tools have caused a huge change in the furniture business. Furniture configurator software is one of the most important ones because it changes how companies design, make, and ship their goods. Not only does this new technology make manufacturing more efficient, but it also makes customers happier by closing the gap between what they want and what can be made. Empowering Customization at Scale One of the most significant impacts of 3D configurators is their ability to support mass customization. In the past, offering personalized furniture often required lengthy lead times, high costs, and complex supply chains. With modern configurator software, customers can visualize their furniture in real time, selecting fabrics, colors, sizes, and finishes that suit their tastes. For manufacturers, this streamlined process reduces miscommunication and design errors. By allowing buyers to interactively preview a product before it's made, companies can minimize costly returns and reworks. What was once an operational challenge has now become a seamless and profitable offering. Enhancing Production Efficiency Beyond the customer-facing benefits, 3D configurators significantly improve internal workflows. Manufacturers can integrate the software directly into their production systems, ensuring that every order submitted through the platform generates precise specifications and measurements. This automation reduces manual intervention, cutting down on time spent translating customer choices into production details. As a result, production schedules become more predictable, material waste decreases, and overall efficiency rises. In industries like furniture manufacturing, where material costs are high, this level of precision can substantially improve profit margins. Redefining the Customer Experience Today's furniture buyers expect a shopping experience that is interactive and engaging. Traditional catalogs and static product images often fail to communicate the nuances of scale, color, and design. With 3D configurator software, however, customers can rotate, zoom, and explore products from multiple angles, gaining a clearer understanding of what they are purchasing. This immersive experience builds trust and confidence. When buyers feel assured that the final product will match their vision, they are more likely to complete purchases and recommend the brand to others. In this sense, configurator software acts as a powerful sales tool, driving higher conversion rates and increasing brand loyalty. Supporting Sustainable Manufacturing Sustainability has become a top priority in the furniture sector. 3D configurators contribute to greener practices by reducing material waste and energy use. Since customers can finalize their design choices before production begins, manufacturers avoid unnecessary trial-and-error processes that lead to wasted resources. Additionally, by shifting part of the sales process online, companies reduce the need for physical showrooms and product samples. This digital-first approach not only lowers operational costs but also aligns with eco-friendly business practices, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. Bridging the Gap Between Design and Manufacturing Traditionally, the transition from a designer's vision to a manufacturer's execution involved multiple stages of revisions. Misunderstandings often led to delays or flawed products. Furniture configurator software addresses this challenge by creating a direct link between design concepts and production data. Designers can experiment with different styles on the same platform that customers use, ensuring that what buyers see is exactly what can be manufactured. This alignment strengthens collaboration across departments, accelerates the design-to-market cycle, and reduces friction throughout the supply chain. Future Outlook for Furniture Manufacturing The use of 3D configurators will grow even more as technology keeps getting better. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are already being used together to let customers place virtual furniture in their living rooms and see how patterns look in real life before they buy. For manufacturers, the future may involve fully automated production lines connected to configurator software, where customer selections immediately trigger production processes with minimal human oversight. This evolution promises faster delivery times, higher levels of personalization, and a more responsive manufacturing ecosystem. Final Thought Furniture creation software is no longer a nice-to-have; it's a must-have for companies that want to stay competitive. By enabling customization, improving efficiency, enhancing customer experiences, and supporting sustainability, this technology has transformed the very foundations of furniture manufacturing. As the industry moves toward an increasingly digital future, configurators will continue to bridge creativity and production, redefining how furniture is imagined, built, and delivered.

Paytm Shares: RBI Clarity On UPI Charges Sparks Rally,"RBI clarified that UPI payments will remain free for users. Paytm (One97 Communications) shares rose 2% on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) clarified that there are no current plans or proposals to impose any fees or charges on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source In a post-policy press conference, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that UPI payments will continue to be free for users. There were some concerns about the sustainability of UPI's zero-cost model, as earlier statements had indicated that UPI may not remain free indefinitely. However, the governor's clarification led to a relief rally in Paytm shares. While personal UPI payments are free, merchants making UPI payments through prepaid payment instruments (wallets) on transactions above ₹2,000 may incur interchange fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.1%, which the merchants bear and not the customers. However, bank-to-bank UPI transactions remain free of any charges for all users. In August, the RBI removed its previous restrictions on merchant onboarding and granted Paytm's fully owned subsidiary, Paytm Payments Services (PPSL), an in-principle approval to operate as an online payment aggregator.

SMEs' spotlight with Pricilla Mukokobi - LinguistIQ: a small business with big dreams,"With just a laptop, internet connection, and determination, Frida Nandjala Katuta started LinguistIQ in 2023. Nearly two years later, her small business has grown into a trusted name for English tutoring, editing and language support, showing what passion and hard work can achieve. Katuta, who has a background in education and entrepreneurship, saw a clear gap in the market. ""I realised many students, professionals and businesses struggled with English. I wanted to offer affordable services that help people improve their skills and gain confidence,"" she said. From humble beginnings, LinguistIQ has expanded from basic tutoring to exam preparation, workshops and business communication services. Technology has also helped her reach clients online, not just in Windhoek but across Namibia and beyond. Although she still works full-time as a teacher, the business plays an important role in supporting her financially and allowing her to assist her family. She now employs one assistant, Hilma Tuukondjele, and occasionally hires freelancers for bigger projects. But like many small business owners, Katuta faces challenges. ""The biggest challenge is inconsistent income. Some months are busy, and others are very quiet. Marketing is also costly but necessary,"" she said. To stay afloat, she cuts down on expenses during tough months and diversifies her services by offering short courses and online tutoring. While she has not yet received government support, Katuta believes small businesses in education deserve more recognition and assistance. ""There's so much potential in skills development. With the right support, businesses like mine can grow and make a bigger impact,"" she said.",New Era Live,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://neweralive.na/smes-spotlight-with-pricilla-mukokobi-linguistiq-a-small-business-with-big-dreams/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.318263,0.3254901960784313
Prairie Island Indian Community Crafts Sustainable Cannabis Vision,"Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. They call themselves Bedwakantunwan, or those who were born of the waters. They are Dakota people and have lived in what is now called Minnesota for thousands of years. Like all Native Americans, their recent history is filled with unrelenting displacement and genocide. This is the Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC) and their story is one of resilience and regeneration. Now, they're bringing that history and value system to legal cannabis in Minnesota. BACKGROUND The tribe is resilient because they're still living on this land after fighting countless battles with the United States government, and more recently, power companies. Their reservation land was created by the federal government in the 1880s with the Dawes Act. Yet their self governance as a tribe was not established until the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, a rare moment of liberal policies for Indian country. The liberal policies did not last long, however, and more broken promises followed. In the 1950s, a hydroelectric dam was built on their land without permission. The dam flooded about 30% of their reservation. In the 1970s, a nuclear power plant was built on the island without consent. It's still active today with drums of radioactive waste within a stone's throw of tribal members' homes. These encroachments hurt the tribe's ability to keep members on the island and provide for themselves. Many rational members decided not to live next to a nuke plant. In 1987, fortunes changed for many tribes in the United States with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This was the law that allows casinos on tribal lands. The PIIC website describes the impact gaming had on their self-sufficiency: In the 1980s a new buffalo became available for tribal nations and, with it, the hope to become self-sufficient once again and provide for the needs of their people. Tribal gaming has transformed not just the Prairie Island Indian Community but all of Indian Country; it is our new buffalo, providing us with the economic means to be a self-sufficient government, educate our members and fight back against the injustices that continue against our Tribe. The prosperity that gaming has brought to the tribe has gone into making lives better for the tribal members. The tribe pays for education, including full college tuition for its young people. Healthcare is another benefit offered to tribal members. Other benefits include housing assistance, food from the community garden, a monthly cost of living stipend, and jobs at the casino and other operations. These funds also allow the tribe to buy more land and to diversify into other areas of business, like legal cannabis in Minnesota. TRIBAL CANNABIS IN MINNESOTA Tribal cannabis operations in Minnesota are a direct result of the state's adult-use legalization law in 2023, which removed state-level prohibitions and allowed tribes to exercise their sovereignty in this new industry. The tribes can build cultivation, processing, and retail facilities on their reservations without waiting for the state licensing program to complete its roll out (changing daily). Unique to Minnesota, the tribes are allowed to have off-reservation facilities as long as they comply with the state licensing rules and requirements. It's necessary to have a ""compact"" with the state, which is a contract that governs the rules of the road for both governments ensuring compliance and sovereignty. As of this writing, only two tribes in Minnesota have the state compact, the White Earth Nation and Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, but Prairie Island told me they are close to signing theirs. The tribes have a significant head start over the state-licensed market and may enjoy ""first mover"" advantage if they execute well. White Earth Nation had the first cultivation facility in Minnesota and provided cannabis to the first tribal dispensaries in the state, including Island Pezi, the dispensary brand for the PIIC. THE ISLAND PEZI TEAM AND CULTURE ""We make decisions, all decisions, by asking ourselves what will happen with this decision seven generations from now?"" said PIIC Cannabis Commission Chair Ed Buck. ""Our vision is long-term and driven by taking care of the next generations, the land, and maintaining self determination and national sovereignty."" This intentionality became clear to me as I toured the cultivation campus and reservation. Not only is the cannabis being grown using regenerative agriculture techniques, a giant solar farm powers the casino. Organic community vegetable gardens abound, and even a growing herd of buffalo reclaim their original place on the prairie. Bald eagles are also part of the family of animals the tribe watches over and supports. All of these rejuvenation efforts are the result of forward-thinking decision-making and the mindfulness of tribal leadership. When the PIIC decided to make their move into legal cannabis, they needed guidance because they were new to the business of marijuana. And their sustainable vision is rare in the industry today. They also needed advice that respected their self determination and values. Tribal leadership sought out a seasoned consulting group called Honest Cannabis to assist them in building sound business units that met their long term goals. Ben Halley, co-founder and COO of Honest Cannabis, has been working with tribal nations for a number of years. He understood the values the tribe wanted to bring to cannabis and the strategy needed to execute. ""It can be risky to cultivate cannabis using living soil and regenerative practices,"" said Halley. ""But the turtle wins the race."" Halley's experience taught him that cannabis grown in living soil is usually of superior quality and commands a higher price. When over-production and price compression happen in the Minnesota market, Island Pezi may be well positioned to withstand the storm. ""There's usually room at the top,"" said Halley. Honest Cannabis went to work building the team to bring such an ambitious vision to life. The first piece of the puzzle was cultivation. The tribe formed a partnership with Good Steward, along with their master grower and founder Tri Nyguen. Nyguen grew up in Minnesota but moved to Colorado to pursue his passion for growing cannabis. ""I made mistakes at first, humbled myself,"" he said, ""and became emboldened to do better at home in Minnesota."" When I asked Nyguen how he learned about regenerative farming, he stopped me. ""What we are doing is NOT regenerative per the definitions of such siloed standards, but rather an approach that pulls many different theories with the underlying idea that we can always do better."" Nyguen cited Korean Natural Farming and JADAM farming techniques, which empower farmer cooperatives to create their own natural pesticides, fertilizers, and microbial inputs from readily available, local resources. ""Regen in cannabis by its definition can be difficult, even more so at this scale,"" said Nyguen. ""The current idea of 'conventional' farming is actually modern farming that takes away knowledge, promising simplicity but at the expense of soil health, human health, and environmental health."" As I toured the garden, I saw many different plants growing inside the same soil as the cannabis. Basil and sweetgrass were two prominent plants in the polyculture, but there were many others. Honest Cannabis next needed to find a manufacturing partner for Island Pezi to turn all that processed biomass into finished products. One of the top hemp and CBD manufacturers in Minnesota at the time was North Star Hemp & Carpe Diem CBD. Their founder and CEO, Ben Lipkin, was brought on board to build the Island Pezi manufacturing plant. Lipkin's track record in the CBD space was well known in Minnesota. Products ranging from infused pre-roll joints to gummies to vape pen cartridges are all made on-site with the same care as the cultivation facility. When I asked him what the best part of his job was, Lipkin didn't hesitate. ""The people,"" he said. ""The company culture is top notch and I enjoy seeing people learn."" The last two pieces to the vertically integrated business puzzle were retail and distribution. Honest Cannabis built the Island Pezi dispensary from their own experience and recommended the tribe also start a distribution arm for the business called Tokahe. Halley's reasoning was simple. ""Diversification,"" he said. ""We can distribute products for any company in the state, both tribal and adult use, and that revenue stream will help withstand market fluctuations in the supply chain."" While the PIIC was not the first tribe to come online in the state, their leadership took its time to do things according to their values. I have toured dozens of cultivation and manufacturing campuses since 2016, and I've never seen living soil and regenerative practices used at this scale. While there was a small indoor garden, also in living soil, most of it was being grown outdoors or in greenhouses. And it's being done far north in a cold climate with a short growing season. Why isn't this being embraced by more entrepreneurs in the industry? It's cheaper to build, more affordable to run, the weed is better and commands a higher price. While plant yields may be lower, in the hands of the right team and culture, regenerative practices can be done at scale offsetting those concerns. The team at Island Pezi are not only building another business for the next seven generations, they may be providing a more sustainable model for the rest of the emerging cannabis industry to emulate.",Forbes,2025-10-01T10:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdeangelo/2025/10/01/prairie-island-indian-community-crafts-sustainable-cannabis-vision/,2025-10-01 18:30:20.319025,0.05882352941176472
Employment and Labor 3A Newsletter - September 2025,"Did you know? During the summer, on July 1st, 2025, the national ""Osez l'IA"" (Dare to Use AI) plan was launched to accelerate the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) in all French companies. The goal is to improve competitiveness, with an estimated productivity gain of 20% per company. The plan sets targets for 2030: 100% of large groups, 80% of SMEs/mid-cap companies, and 50% of micro-enterprises using AI.

Paid leave: double reversal by the French Supreme Court under the influence of European law On September 10, 2025, the social chamber of the French Supreme Court handed down two major decisions that bring French law on paid leave into line with European Union law (Cass. soc., Sept. 10, 2025, No. 23-14.455 FP-BR and No. 23-22.732 B+R). First, the French Supreme Court ruled that paid leave days must be taken into account when determining the threshold for overtime when working hours are calculated on a weekly basis. This solution puts an end to the neutralization of leave, in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. For example: an employee working 32 hours from Monday to Thursday and taking a paid leave day on Friday is now deemed to have worked 39 hours during the week and is therefore entitled to 4 hours of overtime, whereas previously the overtime worked during the first four days of the week would have been neutralized by his leave day taken on Friday. Furthermore, the French Supreme Court judges abandoned a long-standing case law to establish the right of an employee who falls ill during their vacation and has notified their employer of their sick leave to postpone the days of vacation coinciding with their illness. Tips: tax exemption extended... but until when? Since 2022, tips voluntarily given to employees in direct contact with customers have been exempt from social security contributions and income tax, provided that the employee's remuneration does not exceed 1.6 times the minimum wage. This preferential treatment, which was supposed to end on December 31, 2025, is now at the center of a debate: on the one hand, some are considering taxing tips from 2026 onwards, while on the other, members of parliament as well as President Macron are proposing to extend the exemption until 2027 to preserve the purchasing power of the employees concerned. The compromise is uncertain: between now and the end of 2025, it will be necessary to monitor government decisions and legislative developments. In any event, companies in the sector must remain vigilant and anticipate the possible taxation of tips in the future. Business expenses: a new decree has come into force Decree TSSS2523915A of September 4, 2025 (Official Journal of September 6), applicable as of September 7, repeals that of December 20, 2002, and now sets the rules for reimbursement of business expenses, while harmonizing the law with BOSS practices.

"Pfizer India Rises On Trump's Drug Discount Deal  --  SEBI Analyst Eyes Breakout Above ₹5,300","Pfizer shares rose after the U.S. drugmaker struck a deal with the Trump administration to sell key medicines at steep discounts through a new federal website.

RBI To Permit Banks To Fund Merger & Acquisition Activity By Indian Corporates,"Mumbai: In a bid to improve credit flow, the Reserve Bank on Wednesday said it would provide an enabling framework for Indian banks to finance acquisitions by Indian corporates. This has been a long-pending demand of Indian banks. Recently, the State Bank of India Chairman C S Setty also made a strong case for permitting banks to provide funding for mergers and acquisitions, as done by global lenders. ""To start with, we will make a formal request from the IBA (to the RBI)... at least start with some listed companies where the acquisitions are more transparent and are approved by the shareholders. (Thus) The issue of any hostile takeover of the funding can be minimised,"" Setty had said. Announcing the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review, Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra said it is proposed to provide an enabling framework for Indian banks to finance acquisitions by Indian corporates, thereby expanding the scope of capital market lending by banks. It is proposed to remove the regulatory ceiling on lending against listed debt securities and enhance limits for lending by banks against shares from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore and for IPO financing from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh per person, he said. He also proposed to withdraw the framework introduced in 2016 that disincentivized lending by banks to specified borrowers (with a credit limit from the banking system of Rs 10,000 crore and above).",ETV Bharat News,2025-10-01T10:04:16Z,https://www.etvbharat.com/en/!business/rbi-to-permit-banks-to-fund-merger-and-acquisition-activity-by-indian-corporates-enn25100103023,2025-10-01 18:30:20.319772,0.2156862745098038

East African Community Competition Authority to receive merger and acquisition notifications effective 1st November 2025,"The East African Community (""EAC"") has announced that the East African Community Competition Authority (""EAC Competition Authority"" or ""EACCA"") will begin receiving notifications of mergers and acquisitions with cross-border effect within the EAC effective 1st November 2025. The announcement has been made published in the East African Community Gazette dated 1st July 2025 under Legal Notice EAC/191/2025 (the ""Notice"") and represents a key step in the implementation of the regional competition regulatory regime. The new mergers and acquisitions regime applies to the states that are members of the EAC namely Burundi, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda (""Partner States"") collectively representing a regional market of over 300 million people and requiring businesses operating across these jurisdictions to now factor in regional as well as national merger control compliance. With the commencement of the regional merger control, businesses operating across these jurisdictions will now need to consider EAC level notifications requirements, making compliance planning and cross-border regulatory coordination increasingly important. This milestone ushers in a new regulatory era by providing businesses with a centralized regional notification point for qualifying cross-border transactions. The framework is designed to simplify business operations across the EAC and reduce regulatory fragmentation. Mergers and acquisitions play a crucial role in promoting economic growth, innovation, and efficiency. They allow companies to expand, enter new markets, and strengthen competitiveness. In the EAC context, cross-border mergers and acquisitions transactions are particularly significant as they advance regional integration, investment, and trade within the community. The East African Community Competition Act, 2006 (the ""EAC Competition Act""), as amended by the East African Community Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 (the ""EAC Competition Amendment Act""), provide clear definitions of what constitutes a merger or acquisition for purposes of regional competition oversight. A merger is defined as a direct or indirect acquisition of shares, a business, or other assets, whether inside or outside the EAC, that results in a change of control of a business or part thereof, or an asset of a business within the EAC, including takeovers. The same law defines an acquisition as the direct or indirect acquisition of control over the whole or part of one or more undertakings, whether through merger, consolidation, takeover, purchase of securities or assets, contract, or other means. To streamline procedures and align the regime with international best practices, the EAC Competition Amendment Act further clarifies the meaning of the term ""control"" for purposes of regional merger control, which is defined to mean the right of an undertaking to exercise restraint or direction over another undertaking and includes beneficial ownership of more than one half of the issued capital, business or assets of another undertaking, the ability to appoint or veto the appointment of more than half of the members of the board of directors or similar body of the other undertaking, or, the potential or actual ability to materially influence the business policy and operations of the other undertaking irrespective of the size of ownership change. The EAC Competition Amendment Act clarifies that ""control"" refers to the right of an undertaking to exercise restraint or direction over another undertaking, and encompasses situations where an undertaking is able to determine strategic commercial decisions, exercise decisive influence over management or policy, or secure a controlling interest through ownership, contractual rights or other arrangements. Control is therefore not limited to majority shareholding but also includes circumstances such as beneficial ownership of more than one half of the issued capital, the ability to appoint of veto the appointment of more than half of the board of directors or the potential or actual ability to materially influence the business policy and operations of another undertaking. In term so the Notice, a merger or acquisition is considered to have a cross-border effect if it involves undertakings operating in two or more of the EAC Partner States. A transaction must be notified to the EACCA if the combined turnover or assets of the merging parties within the EAC is at least US$35 million, and at least two of the merging parties have turnover or assets of US$20 million and above within the EAC. These thresholds are designed to focus the EACCA's review on transactions that have a meaningful impact on regional competition, while avoiding unnecessary regulatory obligations for smaller or predominantly domestic deals. Notably, the Notice provides an exemption for transactions where each of the merging parties generates at least two-thirds of its aggregate turnover or holds at least two-thirds of its assets within a single partner state. Such transactions are not considered to have a cross-border effect, and therefore, will not require notification to the EACCA. While the EAC Competition Act and the EAC Competition Amendment Act establish the substantive framework for merger control, the detailed procedures for notification and review are set out under the EAC Competition (Mergers and Acquisitions) Regulations, 2025 (""EAC Mergers and Acquisitions Regulations""), issued pursuant to section 49 of the EAC Competition Act. The EAC Mergers and Acquisitions Regulations prescribe the form and content of merger filings, the process for notifying cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and the verification, assessment, and approval procedures to be undertaken by the EACCA. The review process is structured in two phases, which include the preliminary assessment of the transaction to determine if it raises competition concerns, followed by a more detailed investigation where a merger may significantly impede competition. The EAC Mergers and Acquisitions Regulations require a notifiable transaction to be notified prior to implementation, and the parties are prohibited from completing the merger until clearance has been obtained. The merger notification fees payable to the EACCA range from US$45,000 to US$100,000 depending on the aggregate value of the assets or turnover of the merging parties. The commencement of regional merger control under the EAC Mergers and Acquisitions Regulations introduces important considerations for businesses active across multiple Partner States. In practical terms, this means that cross-border transactions must now be evaluated not only against the national merger control regime, but also at the EAC regional level. Once the Notice takes effect on 1st November 2025, qualifying cross-border mergers and acquisitions must be notified exclusively to the EACCA. Businesses will no longer be required to make duplicate filings with national competition authorities. However, any merger reviews already in progress before a national authority will continue under that jurisdiction until completion. The operationalization of merger and acquisition notifications by the EAC Competition Authority represents a significant step towards regulatory harmonization and regional economic integration. By creating a single notification point, the EAC reduces administrative burdens on businesses, accelerates approval timelines, and promotes a cohesive business environment across Partner State.",dentons.com,2025-10-01T10:05:25Z,https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/september/30/east-african-community-competition-authority,2025-10-01 18:30:20.320989,0.2549019607843137
"Maharashtra's new GCC policy targets 4 lakh high-skilled jobs, drive growth in tier-2 & tier-3 cities","Through the policy, the state government is aiming to attract about 400 new GCCs and generate an investment of an estimated Rs 50,600 crore over the coming years. Maharashtra cabinet on Tuesday cleared a dedicated policy framework for attracting Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in the state, with a target of generating around four lakh high-skilled jobs and driving growth beyond metros like Mumbai and Pune. Through the policy, the Devendra Fadnavis led Maharashtra government is aiming to attract about 400 new GCCs in the state and promote priority sectors such as aerospace & defence, agro & food processing, gems & jewellery, logistics, metals & mining, pharmaceuticals & chemicals, renewable & green energy, textiles & apparel, IT/ITES, and automotive by fostering specialized GCC clusters. ""These clusters will provide access to a skilled talent pool, sector-specific infrastructure, and research-driven innovations, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs,"" read an official statement. The policy also aims to develop world-class business districts and a digital databank to map talent, resources, and connectivity, helping new GCCs identify optimal locations across the state. Further, the government looks to promote GCC-led research, initiate multinational collaborations, and attract high-value, knowledge-intensive investments within different sectors. ""The policy is based on the pillars of providing easy access to skilled manpower, sector-specific infrastructure and research-driven innovations, ease of doing business, policy incentives, strengthening institutional framework, and convergence with other policies and programmes of the Central and State Government,"" read an official government statement. Under the Maharashtra GCC Policy 2025, companies investing will be eligible for a mix of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives. On the fiscal side, the package covers capital subsidy or rental assistance, payroll support, interest subsidies, incentives on incremental investment, patent filing and green certification assistance, as well as power tariff subsidy and electricity duty exemption. It also extends research and development grants, internship support under the Chief Minister Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana scheme, and exemptions on stamp duty and property tax. The non-fiscal measures look equally significant, with the government offering industry status to GCCs, additional FSI and mixed-use permissions, open access and right of way clearances, zoning relaxations and priority allotment of reserved MIDC land, as per the official statement. The framework further assures ease of doing business, access to a digital data repository, reliable power and water supply, 24x7 operations and flexible employment conditions to the firms interested in setting up their units. On the outcome front, the state government is expecting to generate an investment of an estimated Rs 50,600 crore over the coming few years. Various state governments across the country have come up with dedicated GCC policies in the past couple of years. The most recent was Madhya Pradesh, which launched a similar policy earlier in January this year, with a target of attracting over 50 GCCs to the state and generating more than 37,000 direct jobs.",ETGovernment.com,2025-10-01T09:54:55Z,https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/maharashtras-new-gcc-policy-aims-to-create-4-lakh-high-skilled-jobs-in-tier-2-tier-3-cities/124255021,2025-10-01 18:30:20.321343,0.6392156862745098
L&G surpasses £200bn in DC assets as it targets workplace flows of c.£50bn by 2028,"L&G has announced its total defined contribution (DC) assets under management (AUM) has surpassed £200bn. The financial services provider said more than half of its assets under administration are across its workplace DC schemes, which surpassed £100bn earlier this year and service around 5.7 million members. This includes assets in the L&G Mastertrust, which announced its £30bn milestone in January. L&G said its workplace DC business recorded net flows up 21% to £4bn at half year - adding that it was targeting cumulative net flows of £40-50bn by 2028. Over the past 18 months, L&G has launched a range of DC initiatives. In 2024, L&G launched its Private Markets Access Fund (PMAF), a fund which has to date attracted £1.6bn in assets. At the same time, the provider also launched its Lifetime Advantage Funds, a 'to and through' target date fund range, which includes an allocation to PMAF. In February this year, L&G launched its guided retirement planner, to offer people aged 55 or over a tailored view of their pensions, savings and investments in a bid to help them create a personalised retirement income plan. L&G said early usage had ""exceeded expectations"", with higher-than-anticipated engagement and action even before full rollout. It said nearly 70,000 members from this group had already begun their guided retirement planner journey - with the provider reporting a 50% reduction in members facing retirement shortfalls after adjusting their plans, adding that one in three members using the planner had created a full retirement plan and strategy while some 20% had taken a ""significant action"", such as deciding to consolidate, enter drawdown or purchase an annuity, as a result. Commenting on the AUM milestone, L&G chief executive of retail Laura Mason said: ""As the growth of DC accelerates, our scale positions us to deliver long-term value. This £200bn milestone reflects the trust placed in us and we're seizing the opportunity to be a lifetime savings partner; supporting sustainable retirement outcomes and driving positive impact for clients, members, and society. We look forward to building on this commercial momentum and continuing to deliver value for customers."" L&G chief executive for asset management Eric Adler added: ""Reaching £200bn in DC assets is a landmark achievement that highlights the strength of our investment capabilities and the trust placed in us as responsible custodians of our clients' pension capital. By combining scale, innovation and diversified asset management solutions, we are uniquely positioned to help shape better retirement outcomes for millions while supporting the UK's economic growth."" More to come Speaking to Professional Pensions, Mason said a combination of things had driven the increase in business, notably the build-up in workplace contributions following the launch of auto-enrolment in 2012, but felt there was ""even more to come"". She said the really exciting but for L&G was around the current changes in pensions such as the Pensions Review, the Pension Schemes Bill and a range of regulatory initiatives. Mason said: ""I think this is really going to enable a different type of interaction with our end customers and members."" She said targeted support was particularly important for L&G in terms of how it engages its members to really start to think about their futures and proactively manage their savings in a way she said the industry ""probably hasn't made as easy as perhaps it could have done"" in the past. Mason said the combination of this regulatory change along with the increasing scale enabled it to invest in and build its digital offering much further - innovation and investment it had demonstrated with the launch of its guided retirement planner and ongoing enhancements to things like its workplace pensions app. The firm has also made some key appointments to boost the way in which it engages with its customers - including the promotion of Paula Llewellyn to the role of chief executive for DC & workplace savings in April. Mason said this focus on engagement mirrored the growing interest seen among its workplace clients. She said: ""Corporates are now much more interested in this as a benefit for their employees. There's an increasing feeling that they need to make a bigger deal of this and become much more interested in what that is doing for their employees."" A seamless savings journey Ultimately, Mason says her key priority is how L&G moves to a position where its end customers can have a ""seamless savings through to retirement journey"". She notes L&G has a customer population that is quite representative - adding that L&G's members were facing the same ""advice gap"" challenges of accessing and paying for advice as the UK population as a whole. Mason explained the firm is now very much focused on how to engage people in a really easy way digitally - allowing them to do as much as possible digitally, with human advice (L&G also has an advice service) as a backup. She said: ""That's our end goal and we are very much building that.""",ProfessionalPensions,2025-10-01T09:59:16Z,https://www.professionalpensions.com/news/4519756/surpasses-200bn-dc-assets-targets-workplace-flows-50bn-2028,2025-10-01 18:30:20.321922,0.2705882352941176
