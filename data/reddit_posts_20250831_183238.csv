1n42rqi,wallstreetbets,$500 to $500K and back to $500,"Although the story is 1Y old, thought of sharing for the weekend fun.
Yes it took 2 months to hit the peak. Back to back so many winners.
The very first peak close to 100K from tesla calls on self driving news, then down to 30K. With frustration went all into our favorite on Friday before market close and said fuck it.
Sunday night Roaring Kitty tweet moving his chair little forward turned into 300K at Monday open.
Then slowly climbed up with so many other trades up/down next few weeks.

Soon I hit 500K someone on this sub told me, I was just one more play away to hit the finish line.

Took full port on GE calls right at the open, then down fall started, same day revenge trades, then VIX",5604,602,2025-08-30 22:18:22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n42rqi,2025-08-31 18:32:12.503708

They spend 1.7B on R&D slash that in have that’s 0.85B in free cash flow
- DAU and MAU is twice that if not more of Reddit and Pinterest. issue is profits per user which has great room for improvement as seen from Reddit.
- Snapchat+ subscription is 42% yoy growth giving cushion from ad related hits

1n4dcsn,wallstreetbets,“$HE -the boring monopoly in the middle of the ocean that’s about to not be so boring”,"Alright you smooth brained degenerates, let me give you the pitch. I’ve been trading $HE (Hawaiian Electric) almost exclusively for the last couple years. It’s not sexy like NVDA, but it’s been my favorite slot machine for collecting premiums writing puts/calls while slowly stacking shares.

Yes, this is the same company whose market cap got slaughtered when people thought they were about to get sued into oblivion over the Maui fires. That litigation has since been settled. It’s literally a monopoly utility in the middle of the ocean. People can’t exactly shop around for electricity out there. I like the stock.

For the past year, it’s been sideways chop city. Nice and flat, easy for me to milk option premiums. But here’s the thing: something is changing.
	•	Since last earnings, volume has been creeping up steadily.
	•	The stock has quietly been making higher highs + higher lows (classic bullish setup).
	•	Call volume is juicy across all strikes – even way OTM covered calls are getting eaten alive.
	•	Premiums are waking up but still cheap compared to the move that feels like it’s brewing.
	•	Chart is sitting at strong support and looks primed for a run.

I stopped writing covered calls and loaded calls instead. Maybe it’s insiders. Maybe it’s just the natural cycle after a year of consolidation. But the tape looks fishy in a bullish way.

Where could it go? $15 looks like a given, $18 feels likely, and dare I say $20 isn’t out of the question if this thing really rips. I’m not here to sell you hopium, just pointing out that the stock is waking up after hibernating. 

I’m long, I’m loaded, and I’m posting this because I know you degenerates like a clean setup with asymmetric risk/reward.

Not financial advice, but if you want a utility stonk with a little spice, $HE might be it.",197,80,2025-08-31 05:39:16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4dcsn,2025-08-31 18:32:12.503720
1n43n2j,wallstreetbets,"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas","No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",644,92,2025-08-30 22:54:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n43n2j/google_cut_35_of_smallteam_managers_over_past/,2025-08-31 18:32:12.503723

1n350ak,wallstreetbets,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",1741,373,2025-08-29 19:36:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n350ak/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,2025-08-31 18:32:12.503768
1n3j0ch,wallstreetbets,Expectation vs Reality [meme + storytime],"🚀 To the MOOOO-… oh. 💥 Anything can look impressive if you frame it in the ‘right’ time horizon.   
Options. The answer is always options. /yes, this is a joke  


(my last post got removed, ig for not being enough of a meme? or maybe my options joke? well, now it's full effort time, with emoji reactions and making sure I fully identify jokes... hey, I'll even throw in educational backstory)

educational backstory: year to date losses were from call options in $SOFI. Those would have fully recovered, if you take a look at YTD performance. I'd been doing quite well with $SOFI in my 401(k), but of course, the moment I liquidated my ever-rolling $SOFI calls in Robinhood (to evaluate my next move), that's when $SOFI mooned, and I figured it was a dead cat bounce, so I missed out. So I've since returned to an old favorite, which is what is driving the portfolio value difference between each screenshot taken within minutes of each other–lots of $VFC call options that have been on a tear lately (I'm sorry–I like en dashes, I'm not AI).

Now for that All-Time loss story. A bit of that was from learning options, but most of those losses, iirc, were from early stage healthcare stocks, a movie ticket service, and a major, now infamous, Indian streaming company that had some loyal followers on forums. I abandoned my $TSLA call options just before it went onto massive gains years ago, and went all in on the streamer.  Actually did seem legit from my DD, because they were merging with a notable American studio that had produced some solid blockbusters. But hey, guess what? Months after that merger went through, the American studio, iirc, sued the streaming platform and they separated. The rest is history. Also tried out a healthcare company with a solid product portfolio and management that had good results on previous ventures. Like a lot of early medical companies seem to though, they used the stock like a piggybank and kept issuing more and more shares. It didn't matter how well trials were doing or what cleared the FDA, because any gain would be suppressed by another issuance and a fair bit of M&A and management bonuses that were funded by shares.

I don't know what it is though. When I'm self-managing my 401(k), I'm very responsible and have solid, market-beating gains. When I open up Robinhood, it's like I need to rep my WSB cred and yolo on some hair-brained idea.

So now I'm on my redemption arc of trying to treat my Robinhood account a bit more like my 401(k).",274,41,2025-08-30 04:56:06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3j0ch,2025-08-31 18:32:12.503771

1n3p42w,wallstreetbets,TA on my portfolio tells me a breakout has occurred.,"Back in 2021, I went from $20k to $200k+ on the original meme mania, lost 75% of it, shorted in 2022 and made it all back but forgot to buy the dip in Oct 2022. Ended up becoming a perma bear (dark days) for the next 12 months hating the world why $NVDA ripped my asshole wide while I cried bubble. 

Fast forward to 2024 I’d stabilized and rode the bull market then got back into bad habits aping into weeklies thinking I’d make $100k in a day again. Revenge trades to literally $0 and hit rock bottom and stopped trading for 8 months. Even had a personal loan at one point. Saved up $30k and got back in the saddle, paid off my loan and finally back over $75k riding $BABA to glory. I’ve not touched options in months and refuse to play $SPY $QQQ weeklies.

To keep this brief, I will simply list all the **catalysts** on the horizon.

# Trump’s executive order: Unleashing American Drone Dominance

On June 6, 2025, Trump signed this [**executive order**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/unleashing-american-drone-dominance/), and if many people are still wondering what **drones** have to do with Archer Aviation, it is because almost no one has reviewed **Section 6**.

The summary of this section is to establish a **pilot program to safely accelerate the integration of eVTOL aircraft into US airspace**.

* Around **September 4, 2025**, the deadline for the Secretary of Transportation to **propose at least five eVTOL pilot projects** will end.
* The **final selection** of these projects will take place approximately during the **first days of December**.

That said, Archer is a strong candidate, and seeing several photos of Adam Goldstein (the CEO) [**inside**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1kskoew/adam_at_the_white_house/) the **White House** only reinforces my **bullish outlook**.

https://preview.redd.it/e8lzk0ushzlf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22e3b4d84f317d4f9ec8486446b6cb846c0c3e7

Here is another photograph, also taken **three months ago**, of Adam [**entering the White House**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1ks97ng/nikhil_at_the_white_house/).

# Participation in events

I am sharing the updated **calendar** that I mentioned earlier in another post on [r/ACHR](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/).

* **September 3, 2025**: [Needham Transportation Technology Industry Leaders 1x1 Conference](https://investors.archer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2025/Needham-Transportation-Technology-Industry-Leaders-1x1-Conference-2025-_AuMrQMIwy/default.aspx)
* **September 4, 2025**: [DB’s 15th Annual Aviation Forum: Airlines, Lessors, Manufacturers](https://investors.archer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2025/DBs-15th-Annual-Aviation-Forum-Airlines-Lessors-Manufacturers-2025-4pygbzHK-0/default.aspx).
* **November 17 to 21:** the **Dubai AirShow** will be held between these dates.

This last event is important because **Adam Goldstein** confirmed in an [**article**](https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/companies-news/dubai-airshow-2025-launches-future-facing-conference-programme-to-drive-global-aerospace-innovation-nivkoppe) published on **August 5, 2025**, that they expect to **fly the Midnight during the event**, and the real question here is whether they will perform a **conventional flight or a vertical takeoff and landing**.

# News with Anduril… probably soon

The management team’s contact with the White House does not seem coincidental to me, given that Archer has stated on numerous occasions that it is working with **Anduril** on the manufacture of an eVTOL for military use.

The problem here is obvious: Adam wants to announce the work the company is involved in at the **military level**, but with the **White House** involved, the issue is **confidential**, and I gather that is why he has not yet been able to reveal anything about it.

And it seems that the relationship with **Anduril** is going from strength to strength, because a couple of weeks ago they were looking to [**hire**](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4704976007?gh_jid=4704976007&gh_src=) an “**Experimental Test Pilot — VTOL**” that could be related to Archer Aviation’s military aircraft.

https://preview.redd.it/rmgmpafwhzlf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce505b1e25a9eb13287e7fdf5e642ad8db299b6

In February 2025, Archer [**registered**](https://uspto.report/company/Archer-Aviation-Inc) 3 new trademarks (Monarch, Giraffa and Mothra), indicating that they are **aircraft**, and I believe that these are the ones that could be related to the **military side** of the company, as well as Palantir and Anduril.

https://preview.redd.it/k88qtwjxhzlf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae2462f0830133e7a3f1fe29cf03ba6a4e72f920

Oh, and of course, we can’t forget **Palantir**: ask yourself what you know about Palantir and **what the US government wants you to know** about Palantir, and then remember that it was recently trading at around $190.

In fact, two recent acquisitions are worth highlighting here: the [**Reddit community**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1mk53ns/a_little_earnings_surprise_nobody_is_talking_about/) has already noted that the **acquisition of Overair** could be highly strategic, as the company generates several million dollars in **revenue** per year, **positioning Archer Aviation as the highest revenue EVTOL company**.

https://preview.redd.it/pkabzfuyhzlf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6edd8b83a3e1d636e1b0ea15759fd07facce1d01

Furthermore, the **acquisition on Susan St**. is also strategic, because **Anduril’s offices are literally a few steps away**, which leads me to believe that the military aircraft is in an advanced state.

https://preview.redd.it/h4s1oqzzhzlf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a8152dab5b3bfd21f19811cfc39add7435d8f55

I can also mention **the anticipated start of operations in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2025** as another **catalyst**, in addition to the **sale of some of the aircraft when they are ready**.

1m1llzv,investing,Annual PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. 

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

That makes sense to me but it brings up a few questions:

1n4prbw,investing,Confused about reallocating wealth managed individual stock portfolio – need advice,"Hi,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my investment strategy. I’d appreciate your perspective on whether to stay the course or reallocate.

**Current situation:**

* No debt, in between $500k and $1mil in annual income, recently received \~$200k and am now reconsidering my investment strategies (or lack thereof).
* \~$700k in a Citi wealth management brokerage account (a mix of individual stocks, not index funds). High AUM fee of 1%.
* The \~$200k in cash is sitting in a high-yield savings account
* Time horizon: 10 years, want to retire early
* Risk tolerance: high / aggressive. Will probably work to the extent I need if my portfolio is too low to retire in 5-10 years, so I think it's fine to remain aggressive with my time horizon.

**Concerns:**

* My brokerage account has grown since 2022, but I realized I would have done better just buying an S&P 500 index fund. I initially chose a wealth management account in 2022 when I graduated college and started working because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle a market downturn on my own. I'm not worried about that anymore.
* I don’t love holding so many individual stocks; it's going to be a nightmare to handle and I don't have time to do market research. But reallocating means paying capital gains tax.

**My plan for what to do before I drafted this up:**

* I just emailed my advisor and requested a call to move my holdings out and close the account. He's underperformed the S&P and the fee is unnecessary. I just am not sure about what to actually do with the holdings:
   * For the \~680k in equities: ???
      * Like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth reallocating and eating the capital gains taxes, but I'm stressed about having to manage all these individual stocks (see **Portfolio snapshot**)
       * Was going to just kill the ~20k in fixed income when I can
   * For the 200k sign-on bonus: easier situation. Planning to dollar cost average (over 8 weekly installments??) into mostly VOO and a bit of VT, thinking 95/5 or 90/10 split.

**Questions for you all:**

1. I’m unsure whether to:
   1. Keep the current portfolio “as is” (and maybe just move the $200k cash into index funds),
   2. Pick out some of these stocks to sell and convert into index funds
   3. Something hopefully smarter than either of those??
2. How would you approach reallocating from individual stocks to index funds in a tax-efficient way?
3. For the $200k cash, would you lump-sum into an index fund now or dollar-cost average over a few months?
4. If reallocating the $600k, what’s a smart time frame (all at once vs. over years)?

I know nobody can time the market or predict taxes perfectly, but I’d love to hear how more experienced investors would handle this situation. I’m aware I’m privileged to be in this position and want to make the smartest long-term choices possible.

Thanks in advance!

Recently, Trump launched another political attack against the dovish Fed Governor Cook. Even if we don’t think Cook will turn into a hawk, such blatant pressure would at least push him and other governors aligned with him to adopt a relatively more cautious stance.

After all, even if the Chair’s stance shifts, considering everything above, he doesn’t fully represent the views within the Fed. The final decision still comes down to the one-person-one-vote process during the meeting.

1n3o97l,investing,I sold my full position (~$110k) in TQQQ today.,"I have been investing $1000 a month into TQQQ on top of my standard monthly investments since Sep 2021, and was up ~85%.  I backtested my portfolio against just investing it into QQQ, and showed that I netted ~$30K more over the same time period.  

This was always intended to be more aggressive than my standard monthly investment in VTSAX, and VOO and my TSP.  

Right now, I intend to sit on the ~$110K in my Money Market for the next month or so.   I believe the closure of the de minimis loophole, the suspension of postal service from 25+ countries, and the steady increases to inflation are going to start impacting the market.  (Yes, I saw today's news headline that the tariffs have been deemed not legal, but with tariffs continuing until at least mid-October, I think the markets are going to have a rough fall.)

Not sure why I'm posting this, I expect I'll primarily get scolded for timing the market, but this was only ~7% of my holdings in a more aggressive, highly leveraged fund and I thought was time to take the profits.  Will be interesting to see if my thesis holds true, or if I regret getting it out.

1n49he2,investing,What is your strategy for the Bond ETFs in light of the probable upcoming rate cut?,"**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **TIPS (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)** generally performs well in an Inflationary environment as its principal and interest payments increase with inflation.
* ***SGOV*** **(iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF)** for people who want to park their money and earn an interest rate that is usually higher than a CD without the restrictions of waiting for maturity.

**What is your plan for the Bond ETFs with the upcoming probable rate cut?**

*The most sensitive one with the upcoming rate cut is probably* ***TLT***.

*On the opposite end, there is* ***SGOV*** *for the super conservative who wants to store money like in a bank account.*

**Yields from Treasury bonds** and other U.S. government securities are **subject to Federal tax but exempt from state and local income taxes.**",9,7,2025-08-31 02:54:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n49he2/what_is_your_strategy_for_the_bond_etfs_in_light/,2025-08-31 18:32:13.516318

> A key Fed-watched measure of inflation rose **as expected** in July, new government data showed Friday. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, closely studied by the central bank, rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on an annual basis, above the Fed's 2% inflation target. Both numbers matched economist expectations, though **the annual pace marked the biggest rise since February.**

> Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment declined to a three-month low as consumers in a University of Michigan survey suggested **they expect inflation to surge over the next year.**

But, I don't think ""The Markets"" really cares about -inflation-.  Rather, increased inflation means less chance of a Fed rate cut, which is -really- what Mr Market wants to see.

In fact, in my role as Curmudgeon here, I'd say that for most of this year, eight months so far, any fundamental news is pooh-poohed in its own right, and ONLY given any value if it, two or three steps removed, increases the odds of ~~finding the Holy Grail~~ getting another rate cut.

There's got to be more to The Economy than the next Rate Cut.

1n400xa,investing,Should I pair momentum with quality or value (or small-cap value)?,"Hey everyone,

I’m trying to build a long-term core + satellite style portfolio and I’m stuck on one decision: what’s the best factor to pair with momentum?

Right now I’m leaning toward quality + momentum across all caps, since it feels like a more balanced approach and I don’t really want to mess with emerging markets too much.

But I also see arguments for value or even small-cap value as a counterweight to momentum. Historically, value has offset momentum pretty well, especially in drawdowns, but small-cap value tends to be more volatile and I’m not sure I want to add that kind of risk.

So the question is:

Does quality + momentum make sense as the “simpler” combo for an all-cap factor tilt?

Or is there a strong case to add value/small-cap value instead (or in addition)?

occurred the same week Trump announced aggressive tariffs on Canada, which tanked the market hard last March. ""Comments over the weekend from Trump that indicate his administration has a high tolerance for short-term economic disruptions and market volatility added to investor concerns. In an interview with Fox Business, Trump didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession, saying that there will be a ""period of transition"". When asked about the market's negative response to tariffs, he said: “What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market.""

1n3ey78,investing,Dell (DELL) Tanks After Earnings: Is AI Growth Worth the Margin Hit?,"Dell just showed us that AI growth is not always as smooth as it looks.

TL;DR: The stock fell almost 10 percent after earnings. Dell says AI server sales will double to 20 billion dollars by 2026, but those servers bring in less money per dollar sold, which is squeezing margins. PC growth also lagged behind HP. Big growth story, but profitability is the concern.

At first glance, Dell’s earnings looked solid. They beat on sales and profit, which normally would be a win. But the market focused on one thing: margins.

The big storyline was AI servers. Dell expects to sell about 20 billion dollars worth by 2026, double what they sold last year. That is huge growth and shows how central Dell is becoming to the AI hardware buildout. The catch is that AI servers only bring in margins in the mid-teens compared to the 20 to 30 percent range they get from traditional servers and storage. The more they sell, the less profitable each dollar becomes. We already saw that this quarter, with operating margins at 8.8 percent instead of the 10.3 percent Wall Street wanted.

The PC side was not much better. Dell’s PC sales were up just 1 percent, while HP posted 5 percent growth. That makes it look like Dell is slipping in that area. And in AI servers, they are not alone. Competitors like Super Micro are coming in fast and hungry.

To be fair, Dell is not falling apart. They still returned 1.3 billion dollars to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, they are handling tariff pressure well, and they see a deflationary outlook on input costs. The Windows 11 refresh could also give them some extra momentum.

So Dell is balancing two stories. On one side, there is a massive AI growth engine that could double sales. On the other side, that growth is putting pressure on margins while competition keeps getting tougher. The market clearly decided to focus on the downside this quarter.

Are investors being too harsh, or is Dell’s margin squeeze a real long-term problem?

1n2us12,investing,Chegg (CHGG): Homework for Sale -- Death by AI Greatly Exaggerated,"Chegg has been treated as the first corporate casualty of generative AI. The stock is down 99% from 2021 highs, now a \~$150 million stub. Consensus presumes a terminal decline as students abandon subscriptions for ChatGPT.

The business reality is a bit different. While core “homework help” subscribers have halved, the company has adapted: 

* CheggMate integrates AI, reducing costs per user and preserving its differentiator of verified content. 
* Busuu, its language-learning platform, is growing 15% year-on-year (B2B up 39%) and expected profitable by 2026. 
* Skills, its certifications business, is growing double digits and should also break even in 2026. 
* Management has removed $165–175 million in annualized costs, bringing adjusted EBITDA to $23 million in Q2 despite halved revenue. Balance sheet shows net cash (\~$52 million) and no solvency risk.

Chegg trades below the price it paid for Busuu alone ($436 million in 2022). At today’s \~$1.40, investors assign zero value to Busuu, Skills, or any optionality. A modest re-rating to reflect Busuu at even 3x sales implies upside multiples of the current equity. Strategic alternatives are actively being pursued, including a go-private. A $3–5/share takeout is plausible, representing 2–4x from here.

Of course there are risks. The subscription base may continue to erode, AI products may fail to differentiate, and competition from free alternatives could worsen. But with net cash and positive adjusted profitability, liquidation is unlikely.

Yet, CHGG is mispriced as an “AI casualty.” In reality, it is a shrinking core business with emerging growth assets and optionality around a sale. Downside is largely exhausted. Upside is 2–5x if Busuu and Skills achieve profitability or if the company is acquired.",66,30,2025-08-29 09:50:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n2us12/chegg_chgg_homework_for_sale_death_by_ai_greatly/,2025-08-31 18:32:13.516379

1n47cuu,stocks,My 8yo is destroying my returns and beating the S&P,"Four years ago my 4yo daughter (now 8yo) started her UGMA account with just $200 and added $50/month. Today her account is worth $4,535.56, up +44.97% overall with an unrealized gain of +$1,390.97.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)
	•	GOOG – +$274.54 (+83.55%)
	•	AAPL – +$59.88 (+79.60%)
	•	MAR – +$39.44 (+75.69%)
	•	AMZN – +$75.66 (+66.14%)
	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts. 

Edit: Hilarious to me that this got flagged as misleading or unverified. I literally tried to post the image of the account with the same info above but this sub wouldn’t let me attach images.

>“TSLA isn’t trading on fundamentals – it’s being actively manipulated through the options market,” Johnson wrote on X. “Despite abysmal news, the stock is flat. Why? Someone is aggressively buying calls.”

>Johnson cited data showing Tesla’s put-to-call ratio collapsed from 0.85x to 0.67x in a single day, indicating increased bullish options activity. Tesla closed at $333.87, down 3.50% on Friday.  
Current options metrics show Tesla’s volume ratio at 0.61, suggesting more call options than puts are being traded. The implied volatility stands at 44.88%, above the historic volatility of 40.95%.

>Johnson’s analysis referenced trading data showing Tesla’s stock price movement from approximately $160 to peaks near $480, with recent stabilization around $320-350. The company maintains a market cap of $1.05 trillion with a price to earnings ratio of 193.51.

>Trump has made tariffs a pillar of U.S. foreign policy in his second term, using them to exert political pressure and renegotiate trade deals with countries that export goods to the United States.

>The tariffs have given the Trump administration leverage to extract economic concessions from trading partners but have also increased volatility in financial markets.

>""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,"" the court said.

>
>The court's decision does not impact tariffs issued under other legal authority, such as Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
>The case is widely is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

I don't see any articles mentioning what happens to these reciprocal tariffs in the meantime, so it's unclear what the immediate impact is

The court is expected to decide soon whether President Donald Trump exceeded his authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 emergency powers law.

>Bessent, Lutnick and Rubio’s statements were filed in support of a request that any ruling against the administration be immediately put on hold until the US Supreme Court issues a final decision. Failing to do so would have “devastating and dire consequences,” Lutnick said.
>
>During July 31 oral arguments before the Federal Circuit, the administration’s claims of broad tariff power were met with skepticism, suggesting the judges might side with separate challenges filed by a group of small businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states. Friday’s filing seems to suggest the administration is worried about precisely that outcome.

It seems likely at this point that the tariffs will at least be paused until the supreme court ultimately makes the final decision

If the economy is resilient but employment is declining, would stimulus even have any effect?

Are we really supposed to rely on a rate cut the so-called cure-all to magically solve automation, AI, the permanent loss of 1.4 million migrant workers, and the uncertainty from Trump’s tariffs?

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",336,147,2025-08-30 01:35:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3dv7e/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654231

1n3xzp0,stocks,KSS still a bargain?,"How did you all feel about KSS when it was $6? Well, here’s how I felt and I bet a lot of you felt the same way… 

I looked at that $6 price and felt confident that it wasn’t going to go much lower than that. I remember thinking: 

“a 50 % drop is way unlikelier than a 50 % jump. For $3 to happen they would have to declare bankruptcy and there’s no way that’s happening. For $12 to happen they just need to improve things marginally.”

Fast forward to today. Does the same logic still apply? I’m not so sure. A 50 % drop would mean going back to $7.5. Would that require unthinkable devastation such as bankruptcy? No. All it takes might just be disappointing Q3 signaling that the turnaround is going to take much longer than Q2 results had us believe. They said July revenue was flat and that the first month of Q3, August, was going great so far. For Q2 earnings they delivered on all expectations and then some. Hard to find anything that wasn’t positive other than the ongoing decline in revenue of course but that was very, very, expected. You don’t go from -5 % expected to +1 % or whatever. 

We’re riding a 150 % jump since April. 150 % in four months. Everything is different now. There are less Neil Saunders out there now. Most analysts doubled their price targets. People now expect Kohl’s to succeed. They no longer expect Kohl’s to go bankrupt. The road from $6 to $15 didn’t require much good news. Kohl’s just needed to show everyone that it wasn’t a dying business. The road from $15 to $30 or even $25 is going to be much harder. They now no longer need to just show they can survive but also that they can compete and win vs peers. 

“Blah blah de minimis exemption ending.” Bro, people that sat on their couch at home buying cheap China stuff on their phones aren’t going to get up and drive to Kohl’s instead. They’ll do the next most convenient and cheap thing which is to order from Amazon, Walmart, Fashion Nova, Zara, ASOS or H&M. Or, Chinese e commerce retailers will find a way to stay to adjust and remain the cheapest option. 

“Blah blah real estate worth $10 billion.” Doesn’t matter at all. Kohl’s is a retail business not a real estate business. In fact, the Q2 results just made the real estate deep value play way more unlikely because the ‘dying retailer’ threat now seems unthinkable, and Kohl’s won’t ever utilize its real estate for income unless it’s a matter of survival. 

KSS isn’t on a 50 % discount anymore. It was at $6. Currently, you’re paying regular price. Odds of it doubling in price are worse than odds of it halving. $7.5 is more likely than $30. 

I’m a shareholder and have been since January. So what am I going to do? I’m waiting for $20 because I still can’t get over not selling on Meme Tuesday July 22 when the stock hit $21. 

I put my faith in what Cramer said yesterday: “[KSS] looks to be a meme stock. It’s up very big. . . .they had news, the quarter was just okay. Just okay.”",11,3,2025-08-30 18:12:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3xzp0/kss_still_a_bargain/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654241
1n41ob2,stocks,What is your plan for the Bond ETFs with the upcoming probable rate cut?,"**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **TIPS (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)** generally performs well in an Inflationary environment as its principal and interest payments increase with inflation.

1n3gv4a,stocks,I want to talk about Nvidia stocks a little bit.,"Nvidia's earnings call was on Wednesday. And to be honest I was quite surprised by the numbers.

46 billion USD in revenue per quarter. And 42.1 billion of it purely from datacenters related business. I.e. selling GPUs primarily. I know they sell NICs and other stuff too. But a big chunk of that money came from GPUs. And that was for a single quarter. Not even 1 whole year.

To put that 46 billion USD number into perspective. Twitter placed an order 100K H100 GPUs one year ago if I remember correctly. 100K x 25K(per GPU) \~= 2.5 billion USD. And that itself was a giant order. And once you spend 2.5 billion dollars on GPUs, there is no chance in hell the company will turn around and buy more GPUs for another 2 to 3 years. Unless the next generation of GPUs show such tremendous performance improvement that they are compelled to buy more GPUs. And let's be honest this is not 1970s that processors can be optimized that much in a year or 2. GPUs are reaching a saturation point in my opinion. Once you buy a light bulb you won't buy a new one unless the current one burns out.

There is a thermal upper limit to how many MOSFETs you can cram on a die. And even the MOSFETs themselves can only be shrunk so much. 4nm feature size MOSFET is an incredibly small MOSFET. An atom itself is like 0.1nm. The MOSFETs we are making today barely have 2000 or so atoms in them if I am not wrong. All of these conclusions arise from Moore's law dying a slow death.

Better architecture is the way these processor manufacturers were able to eek out more performance gains without a die shrink. But at this point we are looking at a 25 year old processor manufacturing company. Whatever trivial optimizations they could make to their GPUs have already been made in my opinion.

In-spite of all of this, these people are selling about 1.68 million H100 equivalents every quarter? And not only that, the next quarter's guidance is about 13% higher than this quarter! And people have priced that into the stock price already. Their PE is about 50! Their stock holders are willing to pay 50 times the annual profit the company makes. And if the company doesn't make that much profit, i.e. sell about roughly 1.9 million H100s next quarter or whatever is the latest high performance GPU, their stock will crash.

I think the biggest bubble in the market right now is Nvidia. People have milked the Nvidia cow to the maximum limit.",71,133,2025-08-30 03:30:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3gv4a/i_want_to_talk_about_nvidia_stocks_a_little_bit/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654247

> Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele. “Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

> The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter. “We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

> Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia. “We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 [cloud service provider] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock. But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1n2hvpv,stocks,Nike to lay off about 1% of corporate staff in its latest effort to refocus the business,"Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill’s efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. 

The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike’s corporate staff. It’s unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike’s EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. 

“As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we’re making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE,” the company told CNBC in a statement. “This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can.”

Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill’s efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. 

Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women’s, men’s and kid’s as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. 

Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike’s innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. 

Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a “small number” of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.

In a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.

Staff will learn if they’re impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.

“To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader,” the memo said.

Since taking the helm of the world’s largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. 

When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that’s now starting to materialize. 

“Instead of a men’s, women’s and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve,” said Hill.

Hill said the company would organize into “sport-obsessed teams” which would “drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands.”

1n3678c,stocks,I May Have Been Wrong About Enovix,"I was an early investor in Enovix that had soured on the stock with the idea that slow adoption has doomed this upstart battery manufacturer. Yesterday, Polaris Battery Lab released the results of their independent testing of the Enovix AI-1 battery. The results are stunning; Not only does it exceed expectations for charge time and cycle life, it achieves 919 Wh/L volumetric energy density, which is among the highest ever reported for a smartphone battery. It caused me to take a second look at what this company brings to the table. It brought me to realize that the investment case for Enovix isn't just about a better lithium-ion battery today; it's about a company well-positioned to compete in the next generation of battery technology. The most compelling aspect of Enovix isn't their current chemistry, but rather their manufacturing expertise and proprietary architecture.

**The Bear Case**

* **Long Time to Market:** Enovix has been in development for a long time, and delays have created doubt about their ability to scale manufacturing. The company must prove it can execute its manufacturing ramp-up and achieve a cost structure that makes its high-performance batteries appealing to a wider market, before competitive progression obsoletes their advantages.
* **Erosive AI Effect:** AI promises to significantly accelerate the discovery of new battery chemistries by replacing the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of trial and error with rapid, data-driven computational analysis. It does this primarily by sifting through millions of potential material combinations, predicting their properties, and pinpointing the most promising candidates for physical testing. This has an erosive effect on all patent portfolios but is especially caustic to pre-revenue upstarts that are attempting to introduce disruptive technologies. Again, it begs the question of whether they can beat the clock and achieve an early mover advantage.
* **Cost and Commercial Adoption:** The lack of widespread commercial adoption to date, particularly with major smartphone and consumer electronics OEMs, raises questions about their manufacturing costs and whether they can compete on price. Without publicly available cost data, it's difficult to verify their competitiveness.

**The Bull Case**

* **Architectural Synergy with ASSBs**: The stacked geometry and Integrated Constraint System that Enovix uses today are not just features, they are solutions to problems that plague ASSBs. Solid-state batteries often require high pressure to ensure good contact between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes. Enovix has already solved this engineering challenge with its patented constraint system, which provides the necessary stack pressure to handle electrode expansion.
* **Safety and Thermal Management**: ASSBs are not immune to thermal runaway, especially under physical stress. Enovix's BrakeFlow™ technology is an in-cell safety feature that could provide a critical redundancy for future ASSBs, which may still face internal short-circuit risks. This is a valuable piece of intellectual property that could be licensed or integrated into future solid-state designs.
* **A ""Placeholder"" Strategy**: Enovix management touts that they are chemistry agnostic. This phrasing allows the marketplace to *eventually* understand their message without revealing their competitive game plan. Enovix's current lithium-ion chemistry is just a placeholder. The company has accumulated a massive amount of expertise (and patent portfolio) focused on the manufacture and physical architecture of the battery rather than a specific chemical recipe. Enovix isn't just a silicon-anode company; it's an advanced battery company, that has long been secretly positioning itself for a seamless transition to new materials, like solid-state electrolytes, when they become commercially viable.

**The AI Revolution: A Catalyst for Enovix**

While AI may pose the aforementioned threats to Enovix, the AI revolution is proving to be a crucial and timely addition to the bull case. The demands of on-device AI are pushing battery power consumption to new heights. The AI-1 battery is positioned to be a first-mover in this segment, offering a substantial increase in energy density and power output. Enovix has given enough cost information to extrapolate an approximate unit cost of around $10. If Enovix can command a premium for this performance, it could generate the revenue needed to fund expansion and find themselves coincidentally (by design) in the right place at the right time. I believe Enovix is the sleeper that could become a major player in both today's and tomorrow's battery markets.

1n2oq1j,stocks,"Dell Beat Earnings but Still Dropped After Hours, What’s Going On?","Dell crushed earnings… but the stock tanked after hours. Let’s talk about why.

On paper, the report looked really strong. Sales and profit both beat expectations. AI server demand is exploding, and Dell raised its forecast from “above $15 billion” to $20 billion for the year. They also bumped full-year revenue guidance higher. Even the PC business, which has been struggling, managed to grow a little.

So why the dip? A few things could be at play. Dell’s stock has been running hot lately, so this might just be profit-taking. It could also be that Wall Street was secretly looking for even bigger numbers. And since NVIDIA was down earlier in the day, the whole AI hardware space cooled off a bit.

The big picture still looks solid though. Dell is clearly carving out a role in AI infrastructure, and that $20 billion server forecast shows real demand. The key questions are whether margins hold up and whether the PC side stays steady.

Feels like the stock got punished more for sky-high expectations than for anything Dell actually did wrong.

1n2mpdf,stocks,How do Stop Limit Orders Work?,"I'm wondering how stop limit orders work.

From my understanding if I set a buy action for a stock with an order type of a stop limit, where the stop price is $10, and the limit price is $10.50. The stock will buy if it's at or greater than $10, and not greater than $10.50. So in this situation $10 <= Stock will buy at values <=  $10.50.

If I set a sell action for a stock with an order type of a stop limit, where the stop price is $10, and the limit price is $9.50. The stock will sell if it's at or less than $10, and not less than $9.50. So in this situation $9.5 <= Stock will sell at values <= $10.



Is my understanding correct? If not, how does it work? What am I missing if I'm wrong? If a stop limit order order doesn't set a buy and sell execution between two values, what order action and order type does?

1n1xk7a,stocks,Intel warns shareholders that the US government's 10% stake could hurt company's international sales,"[https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-warns-shareholders-that-the-us-governments-10-percent-stake-could-hurt-companys-international-sales](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-warns-shareholders-that-the-us-governments-10-percent-stake-could-hurt-companys-international-sales)

One of Intel's biggest concerns is its dependence on foreign markets: In fiscal 2024, the company earned 76% of its $53.1 billion revenue outside the United States, a slight decline from the previous year, but still the lion's share. Sales to entities in China contributed 29% of Intel's total revenue, followed by the U.S. with 24.5%, Singapore with 19.2%, and Taiwan with 14.7%. Now that the U.S. government is Intel's largest shareholder, the chipmaker is directly linked to Trump's unpredictable trade and tariff policies, which could unsettle overseas customers and governments. 

""Having the U.S. Government as a significant stockholder of the Company could subject the Company to additional regulations, obligations or restrictions, such as foreign subsidy laws or otherwise, in other countries,"" a statement by Intel reads. 

In addition, the filing highlights the possibility of negative reactions from investors, suppliers, employees, and competitors. Intel went as far as to mention that lawsuits or political scrutiny could arise and warned that a change in the U.S. political leadership could alter or even undo parts of the agreement, which would cause further consequences.

""Among other things, there could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors,"" the statement says. 

Intel acknowledged it had not finished evaluating the full financial, tax, and accounting effects of the deal, so further issues may arise. 

The agreement between Intel and the U.S. government, signed on August 22, 2025, includes two funding steps. The first is roughly $5.7 billion, which represents accelerated payments from Intel's earlier arrangement with the Commerce Department under the CHIPS Act. The second is about $3.2 billion, which is linked to the CHIPS Act 'Secure Enclave' initiative for critical chips for aerospace and defense, and will be provided as conditions are met. Together, this funding package gives Intel immediate cash ($5.7 billion) and aligns future payments with government programs.

In return, Intel will issue up to 433 million shares of stock to the U.S. government. Roughly 275 million shares will be given out once the first batch of money arrives, while around 159 million shares will sit in escrow and be released only as the Secure Enclave funds are transferred. However, if Intel does not receive all of the expected Secure Enclave money, half of the corresponding shares will still go to the government (no matter how many contracts are signed and for how much), while the other half will be cancelled.",1246,147,2025-08-28 08:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1xk7a/intel_warns_shareholders_that_the_us_governments/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654285

1n1oftl,stocks,"Google has eliminated 35% of managers overseeing small teams in past year, exec says","Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to an audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there,”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

1n1y5cm,stocks,Nvidia CEO Huang says bringing Blackwell AI chip to China ‘is a real possibility’,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said there’s a “real possibility” the company brings its advanced Blackwell processor to China as he urges the U.S. government to open up access for American chipmakers.

He also predicted the artificial intelligence market in the world’s second-biggest economy will grow 50% next year.

“The opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility,” Huang said on Wednesday in a call for Nvidia’s latest quarterly results. “We just have to keep advocating the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race, and help make the American tech stack the global standard.”

Huang personally visited the White House in July and August to secure export licenses for Nvidia’s current-generation chip for Chinese AI, called the H20. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal in which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of China sales of the H20 going to the U.S. government.

After the meeting, Trump said he was open to making a deal for Blackwell chips, which is Nvidia’s latest AI technology that currently comprises the majority of its data center revenue.

Huang has said that it is better for Chinese AI developers to use Nvidia’s chips rather than force them to use homegrown Chinese options by preventing exports, which could incentivize the Chinese tech industry to catch up.

If Nvidia were to release a Blackwell chip in China, it could spur a large amount of sales as Chinese AI developers opt for the most powerful chips available. Nvidia would have to modify its Blackwell chips for the U.S. market to make them slower in certain aspects in order to comply with U.S. export regulations.

“The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn’t make a deal with that,” Trump said in August, before adding that it was possible to make a deal for a “somewhat enhanced in a negative way” version of Blackwell.

Huang’s bullish comments on Wednesday come after the company reported second-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to $54 billion, despite not selling a single H20 chip to China during the quarter. Nvidia said it released $180 million in H20 inventory to a customer outside of China, which accounted for $650 million in sales.

Nvidia said it is not counting on any H20 sales in the October quarter as part of its forecast for $54 billion in revenue, but that the company could sell between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 chips, depending on the geopolitical environment.

“If we had more orders, we can build more,” Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said on the call with analysts.

Nvidia said that while it had received some licenses after the meeting with Trump, the U.S. government has yet to publish official regulations outlining how its cut of sales will work.

“USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement,” Kress said.

Huang told analysts that China is the second-largest AI market in the world.

“The China market I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year, if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said. “And if it’s $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year.”

Recent reports have indicated that the Chinese government is encouraging AI developers to use homegrown chips over those from Nvidia.

“We’re still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,” Kress said.

1n3io7o,stocks,Is the 'Magnificent Seven' Era Ending? Why Capital Might Be Flowing from Big Tech to Small/Mid-Caps (and Why September Matters),"**TL;DR:** High valuations and concentration risk in big tech are pushing investors to rotate into smaller, undervalued names. We may be entering a true ""stock pickers' market,"" and September’s historical weakness could accelerate the shift.

The market feels like it’s at an inflection point. For the past few years, the “Magnificent Seven” have carried the weight of the S&P 500, but cracks are starting to show. Capital could be moving toward smaller, more overlooked companies, and here’s why.

**The Big Tech Exodus**  
Some of the largest names in tech are showing real weakness. Oracle, Nvidia, Broadcom, Tesla, and even Meta have all stumbled recently. High valuations and concentration risk are the two big drivers here. With so much of the market tied to just a handful of stocks, portfolios have become less diversified and more fragile. The unwind of the “big tech AI trade” seems to be underway.

**The Rise of a Stock Picker’s Market**  
Money leaving mega-cap tech isn’t disappearing, it’s looking for new homes. We may be entering a genuine stock picker’s market where smaller, undervalued companies shine. Healthcare is one sector to watch. Merck looks well-positioned to benefit from a strong economy, while Biogen, despite recent weakness, could see upside if interest rates come down. Investors seem more open to considering mid-caps and overlooked names outside of the tech bubble.

**The September Effect**  
September has historically been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That seasonal weakness is now combining with sector-specific cracks, especially in tech. If investors de-risk, this rotation could accelerate, sending more capital into less crowded areas of the market. Volatility may pick up, and those prepared to hunt for value could benefit.

**Conclusion**  
Between stretched tech valuations, concentration risk, and seasonal headwinds, the “Magnificent Seven” era might be losing steam. The bigger question is whether this truly marks the start of a broader rotation.

Are you shifting your portfolio toward smaller or mid-cap names? Which companies do you think are set to benefit most from this rotation?",0,11,2025-08-30 04:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3io7o/is_the_magnificent_seven_era_ending_why_capital/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654301
1n30zsi,stocks,Thoughts from a strategist at Zacks Investment,"$MRVL The stock’s drop so far this year “reflects the high expectations built into AI chip names, stretched valuations that left little margin for error earlier in the year, and added uncertainty from” the company’s exposure to geopolitical tensions with China and broader macroeconomic risks, Ethan Feller, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said ahead of the company’s earnings report.

Still, Feller said the chip company “is positioned as an attractive way to play the AI boom,” because of its application-specific integrated circuits, which it offers to hyperscalers, and its opportunities in networking and cloud infrastructure. Companies related to AI like PLTR, CRM, BGM, APP may get influenced.

 While Morgan Stanley analysts said ahead of the report that they expected Marvell to be dealing with short-term supply issues, they also thought Marvell’s optical solutions business, which are used for high-speed data transmission in data centers, “is stronger than generally perceived, and is more durable and higher margin than their ASIC business.

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",471,198,2025-08-28 04:26:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1s58d/nvda_2q26_earnings_result/,2025-08-31 18:32:14.654305

1maxpqx,SecurityAnalysis,LandBridge ($LB) short report: Stress testing Gotham City Research’s claims,"I’m seeing plenty of aggregator blurbs and quick takes on X, but almost zero rigorous discussion of Gotham City Research’s 7/24/25 short report on LandBridge ($LB). 

PDF link here (original source): https://www.gothamcityresearch.com/landbridge-report

Here’s my summary of their thesis: 
1. Up to 55% of FY24 revenue could be “circular” via related-party WaterBridge/Powered Land deals.
2. $8M data-center deposit allegedly booked as revenue in violation of GAAP principles. Powered Land was incorporated the same day the lease was announced but little public disclosure about the company. 
3. Produced-water royalties over 2x that of TPL’s, which Gotham argues the pricing isn’t sustainable.
4. Deloitte audited the financials, but LB used lax Emerging-Growth-Company requirements as loophole to skip an internal-controls audit.
5. Mixed audit-committee track record: two directors previously served on boards that later restated financials. Previous CFO had abruptly left the company following the IPO and there’s still no public info explaining why. 
6. Texas RRC wastewater-disposal rules effective June 2025 could lift disposal costs 20-30% and squeeze LB’s water-royalty economics.
7. Texas Supreme Court’s June 2025 “Cactus Water” ruling clarifies produced-water ownership in favor of mineral lessees, potentially undermining LB’s pricing power.
8. If closed-loop cooling / water-recycling tech scales, brackish-water demand (and thus LB’s surface royalties) could fall. This risk was barely mentioned in the S-1.

Thus far, I have only seen superficial reactions online to what promoters say is a “bogus report” from a biased firm looking to cover their short position. While I think the framing of some points are skewed (e.g., one of the two audit members had been brought in to help clean up an embattled company’s financials, which is arguably a positive attribute), I think some of these serious issues have merit.

What are others’ thoughts?

Disclosure: I’m long $LB, one of my largest position sizes. Not investment advice.

1m55ghq,SecurityAnalysis,Salmon industry analysis,"Hi   
I've been posting free articles of my own on this sub for quite some time. I believe that they provide good value to members of the sub, but some members have complained that it is not fair to simply post the links, because it is self-promotion, and because after two weeks, the articles go paywalled. Following the suggestion by u/ebisure I'm posting a small summary here, so that at least part of the content remains on the sub, and to make discussion easier. 

  
Salmon is one of the most interesting commodity industries. 

It is a commodity, it has cycles, but it also enjoys rents that are generated by environmental and regulatory constraints to supply expansion. This makes some of the companies in the industry very profitable across the cycle, particularly the Northern European ones like Mowi, Salmar, Leroy, and Bakkafrost. The revenues and margins of these companies do cycle, but at all points in the cycle, their profitability remains elevated. 

The salmon market is currently undergoing a down portion of its cycle, since at least 2021/22. The main driver, in my opinion, has been less aggressive demand, which has not bid up prices as much as during post-COVID. Supply has been very restrained, not growing in the aggregate since 2021. 

However, this year and in 2026, supply is probably going to increase significantly, probably leading to an accentuation of the lower margin situation. I hope this is the case, because at that point, the major companies, which I consider top-quality producers, might trade at attractive valuations. 

Currently, I believe that these companies can grow at 8% across the cycle, and can offer an FCF yield of about 3%, or a 10/11% return over time. I don't think this is particularly attractive, but rather fair. That's why I hope a more challenging 2025/26 season leads to lower stock prices. 

In the long term, the industry is threatened by the (still nascent) effort to cultivate salmon on land-based facilities that eliminate the natural constraints to supply expansion, and therefore lead to a completely different industry. Some people believe land-based will never be competitive, or only with a low probability, while others believe it is almost certain that at some point land-based production will be competitive. I'm somewhere in between, although without enough technical knowledge to judge this correctly.

1lw80nl,SecurityAnalysis,UPDATE: FONAR (FONR) receives Management Buyout Offer,"I have analyzed [FONAR Corp. (FONR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FONR/) on this subreddit [about two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10j8xdh/fonar_corp_fonr_unlocking_hidden_value_in_a/), you can find the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10j8xdh/fonar_corp_fonr_unlocking_hidden_value_in_a/). In the past two years, not too much has happened, but FONAR has been increasing their net tangible book value quarter after quarter after quarter. 

Yesterday, however, there were some rather big news. [The company has received a Non-Binding ""Take Private"" proposal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fonar-board-directors-announces-receipt-210200570.html). The proposal is from their CEO (the son of the founder) and some members of the management team and their Board of Directors (let's call this group the potential buyers). I think their offer is way too low (they are offering at least a 10% premium to the 90 day average before July 1st, when their stock was trading at very low prices, so roughly $15.00). The potential buyers only own 5.01% of the outstanding stock, they will have some convincing to do - and if you ask me, that convincing could be best done by offering a fair price, which has to be at least net book value (which [was at $25.98 last quarter](https://www.fonar.com/news/05152025.html)), or actually even quite a bit more than that.

This situation is looking somewhat similar to [Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WLFC/), where the founders have been trying to take the company private for years, usually offering too low prices. WLFC's stock price went from $50 to above $200 in the process (now back to a bit lower again).

This is certainly going to become quite interesting.",8,1,2025-07-10 17:06:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lw80nl/update_fonar_fonr_receives_management_buyout_offer/,2025-08-31 18:32:15.346615

1lrf1df,SecurityAnalysis,Possible bargain?,"Hey guys, I wanna ask for your opinon about [1502.HK](http://1502.HK) (Financial Street Property). It's a Chinese company listed in Hong Kong that provides property management services. It holds minimal properties itself. What caught my eye is that it was ""punished"" alongside other real estate related companies in China due to property crisis there without being fundamentally affected itself. The stock price has fallen over 90% from all-time highs, whereas revenues have been only increasing (average revenue growth of about 11-12% per year over the past 5 years), it has been paying dividends for several years nontsop (current yield at around 7-8%), it holds much more cash than total liabilities (around 1580 m in cash and equivalents vs 960 m in total liabilities) , and it is selling at a Graham-style below liquid asset value. In fact, it is selling even at a negative EV. If you dig deeper into its sources of income, its business is expanding as properties it is managing are increasing. What do you think guys? I'm relatively new to this, I'm not sure if I found a bargain gem or a value trap. I would be grateful for any insights.

I’m currently researching **“winner” investment theses selected by VIC**.

My goal is to analyze and learn from these top-rated ideas, and eventually write a post discussing key patterns, insights, and what makes a VIC thesis exceptional.

If you have a list of your favorite VIC “winner” write-ups (or know where to find a good collection of them), I’d really appreciate it.

**P.S.** I’ve already come across some great theses — both “winners” and not — written by or attributed to well-known investors like **Mohnish Pabrai, Michael Burry, and Norbert Lou**. But for this project, I'm aiming to go beyond the big names and focus on VIC’s own selection of **winning ideas**, regardless of who authored them.

Thanks in advance — I’ll be happy to share my final analysis once it’s done!",3,5,2025-06-15 01:28:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lbe4qm/looking_for_standout_value_investors_club_vic/,2025-08-31 18:32:15.346679
1lbd0k4,SecurityAnalysis,2 investment ideas from Columbia Business School’s Analyst’s Edge (Fall 2024),"Today, I’m returning to Columbia Business School (CBS) once again to explore a third source of ideas: the latest student investment theses from *The Analyst’s Edge — Fall 2024 edition.*

  
The Analyst’s Edge is an application-only course at CBSwhere 8 to 10 students each year learn what it takes to become world-class investors. Each student writes a full investment thesis on a stock of their choice — often actionable, deeply researched, and grounded in the Graham & Dodd investing tradition that has long shaped Columbia’s value investing culture.

In this post, I’ll share what I found after reading this latest batch of theses. The ideas range from global compounders to special situation plays — all written with the disciplined lens of fundamental investors.



# MercadoLibre (MELI)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Chris Zeng*

The thesis on MELI highlights the company’s position as the dominant e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America, with a powerful ecosystem and long runway for growth. The analyst argues that MELI will continue to benefit from secular trends driving digital adoption across the region, while its unique integrated model — combining marketplace, payments (Mercado Pago), credit, logistics, and other services — deepens its competitive moat.

MELI holds the #1 market share in Latin America for e-commerce, with significant advantages in logistics, brand trust, and scale. The e-commerce market in LatAm remains underpenetrated, with strong growth ahead: only \~56% of adults shop online today, and per-capita spending is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR.

The fintech segment, Mercado Pago, is an even larger opportunity, with total retail payment volume in LatAm estimated at $2.35 trillion. Mercado Pago is growing off-platform payment volume faster than on-platform, and is helping drive financial inclusion in a region with low credit card penetration. MELI’s credit business leverages proprietary data from the marketplace and payment platforms to manage risk better than traditional banks.

**Key drivers** include MELI’s flywheel effects — the integration of marketplace activity, logistics (Mercado Envios), and payments creates increasing user stickiness. Logistics is a strong moat: MELI operates the fastest and most reliable delivery network in the region, outperforming Amazon and newer entrants. Other potential growth drivers include insurance (leveraging marketplace data for targeted offerings) and Q-commerce (quick delivery services).

**Risks** include near-term margin pressure from logistics investments, credit card expansion (especially in Mexico), and rising competition from Amazon, Shopee, and emerging players like Temu and Shein. However, the analyst argues that recent margin compression is a moat-widening investment and that MELI’s network effects, brand, and data advantages will help it maintain leadership.

**Valuation is attractive:** MELI trades at 4x EV/NTM Sales, well below historical levels (it traded at 19x at the 2021 peak), while still growing revenues at \~40% YoY. The thesis expects further margin improvement and operating leverage as the business scales, and sees MELI as a long-term compounder and a key proxy for LatAm’s accelerating digital economy.  


# Tesla (TSLA)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Landon Clay*

The market is significantly underestimating the long-term impact of autonomous driving (Full Self-Driving / FSD), the explosive potential of energy storage, and the optionality embedded in Tesla’s broader innovation pipeline (including the Optimus humanoid robot). Landon forecasts a 73% probability-weighted upside based on 6-year projections, with potential to 5x 2023 EBIT by 2030.

Tesla is positioned not simply as an EV manufacturer but as a vertically integrated tech ecosystem, with competitive advantages in data, manufacturing, and AI. Its massive fleet of \~7 million cars acts as a global data collection engine for training FSD. This dataset gives Tesla an edge over competitors relying on LIDAR and HD maps. The upcoming FSD Version 13 is expected to drive higher adoption (currently sub-10%), with robotaxi ambitions potentially unlocking massive new revenue streams.

The company’s energy storage business — currently growing at \~26% QoQ CAGR — is emerging as a second core business. Tesla already holds 20% GWh market share, and Bloomberg projects 30x growth in global energy storage by 2035. With its Shanghai Megafactory and U.S. capacity expansion, Tesla is positioned to be a top player in this market, generating high-margin recurring revenue.

The Optimus robot is a long-dated call option. While speculative, Landon notes that success here could create trillions in market value. Tesla’s AI training stack and proprietary manufacturing give it a credible path to lead in this space — though realization is likely 5–10 years out.

On the core EV business, TSLA remains the global leader in production efficiency, battery technology, and brand loyalty. The shift to the new “unboxed” production process could increase manufacturing efficiency by 40%, enabling margin expansion even as ASPs decline. The U.S. market still has significant room to grow EV penetration (currently \~10% of new sales), and FSD success could further accelerate demand.

**Key risks** include failure of FSD to reach full autonomy, key-man risk around Elon Musk, geopolitical or commodity price shocks, and potential regulatory hurdles. However, the thesis argues that Tesla’s innovation-driven culture, scale advantages, and multi-business model flywheel give it asymmetric upside compared to traditional auto peers.

At **current valuation** (with EV/EBIT multiples expected to compress from \~116x to \~75x), the analyst sees significant room for Tesla to compound value across its automotive, energy, and AI segments over the next decade.

1l3c1l1,SecurityAnalysis,Stride Inc. (LRN): A Cash-Flowing Compounder Hiding in EdTech Clothing,"Wanted to share a name I’ve been following and holding for a while now: Stride Inc. (LRN). It’s returned nearly 60% since I first wrote about it—but I think there’s still meaningful upside left.

Stride operates state-funded virtual schools in the U.S. (mostly K–12), and increasingly, a second business: Career Learning (IT, healthcare, skilled trades training). That second segment is growing 30%+ and has much better margins.

They’re one of the few edtech companies that are:

* Profitable (13x earnings, positive FCF)
* Growing double digits
* Operating with contractual revenue visibility (5–7 year school contracts)

The Career Learning business could soon be >40% of revenue and drive long-term margin expansion. They’ve made disciplined tuck-in acquisitions, and SG&A is beginning to scale. Management recently raised guidance, and cash flow is supporting buybacks.

Quick Fundamentals:

* Market cap: \~$2.3B
* FY25 revenue: \~$2.3B
* EBITDA margin: \~20% (up from high single digits 5 years ago)
* FCF positive (>$150M TTM)
* No net debt (actually net cash position of $193M)
* EV/EBITDA (fwd): \~10x
* FCF yield: \~4%

Risks:

* U.S. K–12 enrollment is shrinking due to birth trends
* Politically exposed (virtual charters draw scrutiny in some states)
* Some dilution risk (shares up \~4.3% CAGR), though offset by a buyback plan
* Cyclical pressure in adult upskilling if the labor market softens

But the demographic headwind could reverse if immigration increases or Career Learning takes over as the growth driver. In the meantime, they’re executing well and compounding quietly.

1l2hm9d,SecurityAnalysis,"2x FCF, 5% of NAV: Hong Kong Hotel & Office Owner (A-Z Smallcap sweep)","I went through all the small caps in Hong Kong (A–Z). This is the most compelling deep value stock I found.

* **Market Cap:** \~HKD 300M
* **Free Cash Flow:** \~HKD 150M
* **NAV:** \~HKD 6B (yes, that's \~20x the market cap)
* **P/FCF:** \~2x
* **Debt:** \~HKD 1B (low vs. asset base)
* **Ticker:** 0219 (HK)

The company owns multiple hotels (Best Western, Ramada, etc.) and commercial real estate in HK, plus a London hotel leased to Travelodge on a **12-year inflation-linked, full-repairing lease** (Travelodge pays GBP 4.5M/year and handles all maintenance).

# Why I think it's cheap:

* **Accounting masks true earnings** – Depreciation on valuable hotel properties makes earnings look worse than they are. Classic hidden value.
* **Messy holding structure** – Hard to untangle, but there's value underneath.
* **Negative sentiment** – HK protests, COVID, the China property downturn... all piled on.
* **Very illiquid.** – Many days there are no transactions, some days see 100k+ shares changing hands.

The company used to pay dividends, but is currently reinvesting in property. Management isn’t changing due to the structure.

*Note:* I use P/FCF because with sales of 1-2 properties, debt could be eliminated. The earnings lost from selling properties will be equal to the interest expense thus saved. Then EV = Market Cap and FCF stays the same.

I'd love to hear thoughts from other analysts:
