META,AI Startups Have Entered Their Emotional Brand Building Era,"In the race to win over consumers, AI startups are turning to an age-old marketing strategy: trying to make people feel something.
Like Perplexity, which released its first celebrity-led ad in March, these campaigns use classic brand building techniques like storytelling, emotional messaging, and cultural partnerships—fundamental to creative advertising across sectors, but largely untapped by AI startups until now.
In just a few years, some AI startups have rocketed to sky-high valuations, with OpenAI valued at $324 billion and Anthropic at $178 billion, according to Forge Global data.
The message is that Claude is “an AI you can trust with your most meaningful challenges,” said Andrew Stirk, head of brand marketing at Anthropic.
Or, according to Williams, AI startups could “transform into big lifestyle brands” like Apple or Spotify, which are also widely acclaimed for their brand storytelling.",Adweek,2025-09-29T06:00:00Z,https://www.adweek.com/creativity/ai-startups-have-entered-their-emotional-brand-building-era/,2025-09-30 16:37:25.895611
META,ADHD drugs linked to psychosis and bipolar risk as study exposes amphetamine dangers,"ADHD drugs linked to psychosis and bipolar risk as study exposes amphetamine dangersPrescription stimulants for ADHD carry a small but real risk of triggering psychosis and bipolar disorder, with amphetamines like Adderall showing a 60% higher psychosis risk than Ritalin.
High doses of amphetamines increase psychosis risk fivefold, linked to excessive dopamine surges that disrupt brain function in vulnerable individuals.
ADHD, psychosis, and bipolar disorder all involve irregular dopamine activity, and stimulants—especially amphetamines—flood the brain with up to four times more dopamine than methylphenidate.
A 2024 Harvard study found that high-dose amphetamine users faced a fivefold increase in psychosis risk, yet these drugs continue to be handed out like candy.
If there’s a genetic risk, stimulants may not be worth the gamble.",Naturalnews.com,2025-09-29T06:00:00Z,https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-09-29-adhd-drugs-psychosis-bipolar-risk-amphetamine.html,2025-09-30 16:37:27.383753
