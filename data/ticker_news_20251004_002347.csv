AAPL,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

Nasdaq Composite: Finished at 22,831.05, up 0.33%, led by technology and AI stocks.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Ended at 46,547.37, a 0.23% gain with mixed blue-chip performance.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Top Gainers Today

Nvidia (NVDA): Up 1.59%, driven by strong AI demand and positive earnings.

Microsoft (MSFT): Up 1.45%, boosted by cloud and AI product growth.

Nike (NKE): Up 1.56%, supported by strong retail sales and brand demand.

Caterpillar (CAT): Up 1.55%, fueled by steady manufacturing and construction activity.

Apple (AAPL): Up 1.38%, on investor optimism around new product launches.

Tesla (TSLA): Up 1.32%, benefiting from strong EV sales and expansion news.

Walmart (WMT): Down 1.54%, impacted by slower retail growth.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Down 1.36%, facing profit-taking and market caution.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Down 1.28%, affected by interest rate expectations.

Procter & Gamble (PG): Down 1.10%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

AAPL,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

AAPL,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Article content

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

AAPL,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

AAPL,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

AAPL,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:18:16.619587,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

AAPL,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:16:26.623555,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq mixed as AI optimism blots out US shutdown risks","US stocks rose on Thursday as the AI trade continued to power a push for fresh records amid new buzz around OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week.

AAPL,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq gains fizzle with AI buzz, Trump's shutdown threats in focus","US stocks rose on Thursday as the AI trade continued to power a push for fresh records amid new buzz around OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.

AAPL,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

READ MORE: Fed’s favored inflation gauge accelerated slightly in August, report shows

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

WATCH: Chicago Fed president unpacks weak jobs report and what it says about the economy

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

AAPL,Job losses might be likely due to AI but Nvidia's CEO says the booming billion-dollar industry will always need more plumbers and electricians,"The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top.

In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, ""If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories.""

Huang argues, ""The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom"".

""You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year.""

Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago.

OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing ""US dominance in artificial intelligence"". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions.

When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, ""just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too.""

Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse.

Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that ""Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers"". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be ""totally, totally gone"" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a ""short-term dystopia"" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing.

Huang tells reporters, ""You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade,"" but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that.",PC Gamer,2025-10-02T14:14:43Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/job-losses-might-be-likely-due-to-ai-but-nvidias-ceo-says-the-booming-billion-dollar-industry-will-always-need-more-plumbers-and-electricians/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:18.015314,0.9999999999999999,

GOOGL,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

Nasdaq Composite: Finished at 22,831.05, up 0.33%, led by technology and AI stocks.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Ended at 46,547.37, a 0.23% gain with mixed blue-chip performance.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Top Gainers Today

Nvidia (NVDA): Up 1.59%, driven by strong AI demand and positive earnings.

Microsoft (MSFT): Up 1.45%, boosted by cloud and AI product growth.

Nike (NKE): Up 1.56%, supported by strong retail sales and brand demand.

Caterpillar (CAT): Up 1.55%, fueled by steady manufacturing and construction activity.

Apple (AAPL): Up 1.38%, on investor optimism around new product launches.

Tesla (TSLA): Up 1.32%, benefiting from strong EV sales and expansion news.

Amazon (AMZN): Up 1.29%, helped by e-commerce and cloud revenue growth.

Top Losers Today

Walmart (WMT): Down 1.54%, impacted by slower retail growth.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Down 1.36%, facing profit-taking and market caution.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Down 1.28%, affected by interest rate expectations.

Bank of America (BAC): Down 1.22%, weighed by financial sector volatility.

Chevron (CVX): Down 1.18%, pressured by fluctuating oil prices.

Coca-Cola (KO): Down 1.12%, impacted by weaker consumer demand.

Procter & Gamble (PG): Down 1.10%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

GOOGL,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

GOOGL,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

GOOGL,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

GOOGL,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:44.052965,0.9999999999999999,

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

GOOGL,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:43.641673,0.9999999999999999,

GOOGL,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

READ MORE: Fed’s favored inflation gauge accelerated slightly in August, report shows

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

READ MORE: What to know about the Fed’s rate cut and mortgage rates

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

WATCH: Chicago Fed president unpacks weak jobs report and what it says about the economy

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

MSFT,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

MSFT,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

MSFT,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Article content

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

MSFT,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

MSFT,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

MSFT,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:45.277522,0.9999999999999999,
MSFT,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

MSFT,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:44.853546,0.9999999999999999,

A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

TSLA,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

Nasdaq Composite: Finished at 22,831.05, up 0.33%, led by technology and AI stocks.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Ended at 46,547.37, a 0.23% gain with mixed blue-chip performance.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Top Gainers Today

Nvidia (NVDA): Up 1.59%, driven by strong AI demand and positive earnings.

Microsoft (MSFT): Up 1.45%, boosted by cloud and AI product growth.

Nike (NKE): Up 1.56%, supported by strong retail sales and brand demand.

Caterpillar (CAT): Up 1.55%, fueled by steady manufacturing and construction activity.

Apple (AAPL): Up 1.38%, on investor optimism around new product launches.

Tesla (TSLA): Up 1.32%, benefiting from strong EV sales and expansion news.

Amazon (AMZN): Up 1.29%, helped by e-commerce and cloud revenue growth.

Top Losers Today

Walmart (WMT): Down 1.54%, impacted by slower retail growth.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Down 1.36%, facing profit-taking and market caution.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Down 1.28%, affected by interest rate expectations.

Bank of America (BAC): Down 1.22%, weighed by financial sector volatility.

Chevron (CVX): Down 1.18%, pressured by fluctuating oil prices.

Coca-Cola (KO): Down 1.12%, impacted by weaker consumer demand.

Procter & Gamble (PG): Down 1.10%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

TSLA,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

TSLA,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

TSLA,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq mixed as AI optimism blots out US shutdown risks","US stocks rose on Thursday as the AI trade continued to power a push for fresh records amid new buzz around OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

TSLA,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

TSLA,Echo Global keeps Moody’s B3 rating in tough market,"Outlook for the future is for steady performance but little chance of a big turnaround

Echo Global Logistics has managed to hold its debt rating at Moody’s as the ratings agency said it expects the company, even in the midst of the current freight market, to “maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity.”

The corporate family rating at Moody’s for Echo Global was maintained at B3. That rating is considered equivalent to a B- at S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has had Echo Global at that level for approximately two years after a downgrade.

Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) also affirmed Echo’s probability of default rating at B3-PD and senior secured bank credit facilities rating at B2, a notch higher than the corporate family rating.

The ratings agency also held the company’s outlook at stable.

Six notches deep

Both the Moody’s B3 rating and an S&P B- rating are six notches into non-investment grade territory.

Echo Global has been in the public debt markets for approximately four years. Moody’s gave it a B2 rating when Echo Global first issued publicly traded debt, and downgraded it to B3 in November 2023, not long after S&P Global had made its downward shift.

Its move into debt markets came after the once publicly-traded company announced its acquisition by The Jordan Co.

While the Moody’s report does not provide any figures on revenue or profitability, which is standard practice, its general comments suggest a 3PL that is holding its own in the current freight market but with only a small chance of an imminent turnaround.

Market position is steady

“Echo has demonstrated modest freight volume growth despite soft economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector where the company derives a good portion of freight activity,” Moody’s said in its report. “Nonetheless, Echo’s credit metrics, including financial leverage and interest coverage, remain weak. Therefore, we believe the company’s financial flexibility is limited until broader freight market conditions improve.”

A summation of Echo Global’s economics said it was a company that had “low profit margin, high leverage, and expectations for modest free cash flow over next 12 months.” But the report also said Moody’s believes Echo Global “will maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity as it continues to navigate a persistently challenging freight trucking environment.”

EBITDA margin: count on 3%

EBITDA margins at Echo Global are usually 3%-5%, Moody’s said. As a point of comparison, RXO (NYSE: RXO), which is a publicly-traded 3PL, reported a second quarter EBITDA margin of 2.7%, compared to 3% a year earlier.

Moody’s sees that 3% EBITDA margin holding in place “as cost saving actions will help offset any margin pressure tied to soft freight rates. Echo Global’s margin also reflects a mix toward less profitable contracted volumes compared to spot volumes.”

Echo Global, Moody’s said, has a “highly variable cost structure that can be flexed during downturns.”

One of the key measurements a ratings agency looks at is a company’s debt to EBITDA margin.

Moody’s said it expects Echo Global’s debt/EBITDA margin to be “slightly below” 7X at the end of t his year, moving to 6.5X next year. By contrast, when S&P Global raised its debt rating on 3PL C.H. Robinson in August, it said the debt to EBITDA ratio in that company was on its way to the mid-1X range.

“(Echo’s) leverage remains very high at this point of the freight cycle with limited cushion to withstand any earnings decline,” the Moody’s rating affirmation said.

Other comments about the company in the Moody’s report were mostly upbeat. Echo, the agency said, “maintains good scale with longstanding relationships and considerable diversity within its customer base (i.e. shippers) and transportation carriers. These relationships, along with solid technology capabilities, have helped Echo increase transportation volumes despite broader market softness.”

Recent ratings actions on 3PLs in the middle of a freight recession have been mixed.

C.H. Robinson’s debt rating was upgraded by S&P Global to BBB+ in August, eight notches above an equivalent comparison to the Echo Global rating. Odyssey Logistics was cut by Moody’s in September. RXO held its rating a year ago when it plunked down a little more than a billion dollars to acquire Coyote Logistics, though its Baa3 rating from Moody’s is investment grade while the BB rating at S&P Global is not.

An email request for comment to Echo Global had not been responded to by publication time.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

TSLA,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

TSLA,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:49.286964,0.9999999999999999,
TSLA,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

TSLA,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:48.835547,0.9999999999999999,
TSLA,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

READ MORE: Fed’s favored inflation gauge accelerated slightly in August, report shows

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

READ MORE: What to know about the Fed’s rate cut and mortgage rates

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

WATCH: Chicago Fed president unpacks weak jobs report and what it says about the economy

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

AMZN,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

AMZN,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

AMZN,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

AMZN,Echo Global keeps Moody’s B3 rating in tough market,"Outlook for the future is for steady performance but little chance of a big turnaround

Echo Global Logistics has managed to hold its debt rating at Moody’s as the ratings agency said it expects the company, even in the midst of the current freight market, to “maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity.”

The corporate family rating at Moody’s for Echo Global was maintained at B3. That rating is considered equivalent to a B- at S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has had Echo Global at that level for approximately two years after a downgrade.

Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) also affirmed Echo’s probability of default rating at B3-PD and senior secured bank credit facilities rating at B2, a notch higher than the corporate family rating.

The ratings agency also held the company’s outlook at stable.

Six notches deep

Both the Moody’s B3 rating and an S&P B- rating are six notches into non-investment grade territory.

Echo Global has been in the public debt markets for approximately four years. Moody’s gave it a B2 rating when Echo Global first issued publicly traded debt, and downgraded it to B3 in November 2023, not long after S&P Global had made its downward shift.

Its move into debt markets came after the once publicly-traded company announced its acquisition by The Jordan Co.

While the Moody’s report does not provide any figures on revenue or profitability, which is standard practice, its general comments suggest a 3PL that is holding its own in the current freight market but with only a small chance of an imminent turnaround.

Market position is steady

“Echo has demonstrated modest freight volume growth despite soft economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector where the company derives a good portion of freight activity,” Moody’s said in its report. “Nonetheless, Echo’s credit metrics, including financial leverage and interest coverage, remain weak. Therefore, we believe the company’s financial flexibility is limited until broader freight market conditions improve.”

A summation of Echo Global’s economics said it was a company that had “low profit margin, high leverage, and expectations for modest free cash flow over next 12 months.” But the report also said Moody’s believes Echo Global “will maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity as it continues to navigate a persistently challenging freight trucking environment.”

EBITDA margin: count on 3%

EBITDA margins at Echo Global are usually 3%-5%, Moody’s said. As a point of comparison, RXO (NYSE: RXO), which is a publicly-traded 3PL, reported a second quarter EBITDA margin of 2.7%, compared to 3% a year earlier.

Moody’s sees that 3% EBITDA margin holding in place “as cost saving actions will help offset any margin pressure tied to soft freight rates. Echo Global’s margin also reflects a mix toward less profitable contracted volumes compared to spot volumes.”

Echo Global, Moody’s said, has a “highly variable cost structure that can be flexed during downturns.”

One of the key measurements a ratings agency looks at is a company’s debt to EBITDA margin.

Moody’s said it expects Echo Global’s debt/EBITDA margin to be “slightly below” 7X at the end of t his year, moving to 6.5X next year. By contrast, when S&P Global raised its debt rating on 3PL C.H. Robinson in August, it said the debt to EBITDA ratio in that company was on its way to the mid-1X range.

“(Echo’s) leverage remains very high at this point of the freight cycle with limited cushion to withstand any earnings decline,” the Moody’s rating affirmation said.

Other comments about the company in the Moody’s report were mostly upbeat. Echo, the agency said, “maintains good scale with longstanding relationships and considerable diversity within its customer base (i.e. shippers) and transportation carriers. These relationships, along with solid technology capabilities, have helped Echo increase transportation volumes despite broader market softness.”

Recent ratings actions on 3PLs in the middle of a freight recession have been mixed.

C.H. Robinson’s debt rating was upgraded by S&P Global to BBB+ in August, eight notches above an equivalent comparison to the Echo Global rating. Odyssey Logistics was cut by Moody’s in September. RXO held its rating a year ago when it plunked down a little more than a billion dollars to acquire Coyote Logistics, though its Baa3 rating from Moody’s is investment grade while the BB rating at S&P Global is not.

An email request for comment to Echo Global had not been responded to by publication time.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Article content

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

AMZN,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

AMZN,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

AMZN,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:50.688199,0.9999999999999999,
AMZN,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

AMZN,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:50.209568,0.9999999999999999,
AMZN,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq mixed as AI optimism blots out US shutdown risks","US stocks rose on Thursday as the AI trade continued to power a push for fresh records amid new buzz around OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

AMZN,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

NVDA,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

Nasdaq Composite: Finished at 22,831.05, up 0.33%, led by technology and AI stocks.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Ended at 46,547.37, a 0.23% gain with mixed blue-chip performance.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Top Gainers Today

Nvidia (NVDA): Up 1.59%, driven by strong AI demand and positive earnings.

Microsoft (MSFT): Up 1.45%, boosted by cloud and AI product growth.

Nike (NKE): Up 1.56%, supported by strong retail sales and brand demand.

Caterpillar (CAT): Up 1.55%, fueled by steady manufacturing and construction activity.

Apple (AAPL): Up 1.38%, on investor optimism around new product launches.

Top Losers Today

Walmart (WMT): Down 1.54%, impacted by slower retail growth.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Down 1.36%, facing profit-taking and market caution.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Down 1.28%, affected by interest rate expectations.

Bank of America (BAC): Down 1.22%, weighed by financial sector volatility.

Coca-Cola (KO): Down 1.12%, impacted by weaker consumer demand.

Procter & Gamble (PG): Down 1.10%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

NVDA,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

NVDA,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

NVDA,Echo Global keeps Moody’s B3 rating in tough market,"Outlook for the future is for steady performance but little chance of a big turnaround

Echo Global Logistics has managed to hold its debt rating at Moody’s as the ratings agency said it expects the company, even in the midst of the current freight market, to “maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity.”

The corporate family rating at Moody’s for Echo Global was maintained at B3. That rating is considered equivalent to a B- at S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has had Echo Global at that level for approximately two years after a downgrade.

Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) also affirmed Echo’s probability of default rating at B3-PD and senior secured bank credit facilities rating at B2, a notch higher than the corporate family rating.

The ratings agency also held the company’s outlook at stable.

Six notches deep

Both the Moody’s B3 rating and an S&P B- rating are six notches into non-investment grade territory.

Echo Global has been in the public debt markets for approximately four years. Moody’s gave it a B2 rating when Echo Global first issued publicly traded debt, and downgraded it to B3 in November 2023, not long after S&P Global had made its downward shift.

Its move into debt markets came after the once publicly-traded company announced its acquisition by The Jordan Co.

While the Moody’s report does not provide any figures on revenue or profitability, which is standard practice, its general comments suggest a 3PL that is holding its own in the current freight market but with only a small chance of an imminent turnaround.

Market position is steady

“Echo has demonstrated modest freight volume growth despite soft economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector where the company derives a good portion of freight activity,” Moody’s said in its report. “Nonetheless, Echo’s credit metrics, including financial leverage and interest coverage, remain weak. Therefore, we believe the company’s financial flexibility is limited until broader freight market conditions improve.”

A summation of Echo Global’s economics said it was a company that had “low profit margin, high leverage, and expectations for modest free cash flow over next 12 months.” But the report also said Moody’s believes Echo Global “will maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity as it continues to navigate a persistently challenging freight trucking environment.”

EBITDA margin: count on 3%

EBITDA margins at Echo Global are usually 3%-5%, Moody’s said. As a point of comparison, RXO (NYSE: RXO), which is a publicly-traded 3PL, reported a second quarter EBITDA margin of 2.7%, compared to 3% a year earlier.

Moody’s sees that 3% EBITDA margin holding in place “as cost saving actions will help offset any margin pressure tied to soft freight rates. Echo Global’s margin also reflects a mix toward less profitable contracted volumes compared to spot volumes.”

Echo Global, Moody’s said, has a “highly variable cost structure that can be flexed during downturns.”

One of the key measurements a ratings agency looks at is a company’s debt to EBITDA margin.

Moody’s said it expects Echo Global’s debt/EBITDA margin to be “slightly below” 7X at the end of t his year, moving to 6.5X next year. By contrast, when S&P Global raised its debt rating on 3PL C.H. Robinson in August, it said the debt to EBITDA ratio in that company was on its way to the mid-1X range.

“(Echo’s) leverage remains very high at this point of the freight cycle with limited cushion to withstand any earnings decline,” the Moody’s rating affirmation said.

Other comments about the company in the Moody’s report were mostly upbeat. Echo, the agency said, “maintains good scale with longstanding relationships and considerable diversity within its customer base (i.e. shippers) and transportation carriers. These relationships, along with solid technology capabilities, have helped Echo increase transportation volumes despite broader market softness.”

Recent ratings actions on 3PLs in the middle of a freight recession have been mixed.

C.H. Robinson’s debt rating was upgraded by S&P Global to BBB+ in August, eight notches above an equivalent comparison to the Echo Global rating. Odyssey Logistics was cut by Moody’s in September. RXO held its rating a year ago when it plunked down a little more than a billion dollars to acquire Coyote Logistics, though its Baa3 rating from Moody’s is investment grade while the BB rating at S&P Global is not.

An email request for comment to Echo Global had not been responded to by publication time.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

NVDA,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

NVDA,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

NVDA,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:52.045589,0.9999999999999999,
NVDA,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

NVDA,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:51.584440,0.9999999999999999,
NVDA,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

READ MORE: Fed’s favored inflation gauge accelerated slightly in August, report shows

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

READ MORE: What to know about the Fed’s rate cut and mortgage rates

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

WATCH: Chicago Fed president unpacks weak jobs report and what it says about the economy

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

META,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

META,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

META,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

META,Echo Global keeps Moody’s B3 rating in tough market,"Outlook for the future is for steady performance but little chance of a big turnaround

Echo Global Logistics has managed to hold its debt rating at Moody’s as the ratings agency said it expects the company, even in the midst of the current freight market, to “maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity.”

The corporate family rating at Moody’s for Echo Global was maintained at B3. That rating is considered equivalent to a B- at S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has had Echo Global at that level for approximately two years after a downgrade.

Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) also affirmed Echo’s probability of default rating at B3-PD and senior secured bank credit facilities rating at B2, a notch higher than the corporate family rating.

The ratings agency also held the company’s outlook at stable.

Six notches deep

Both the Moody’s B3 rating and an S&P B- rating are six notches into non-investment grade territory.

Echo Global has been in the public debt markets for approximately four years. Moody’s gave it a B2 rating when Echo Global first issued publicly traded debt, and downgraded it to B3 in November 2023, not long after S&P Global had made its downward shift.

Its move into debt markets came after the once publicly-traded company announced its acquisition by The Jordan Co.

While the Moody’s report does not provide any figures on revenue or profitability, which is standard practice, its general comments suggest a 3PL that is holding its own in the current freight market but with only a small chance of an imminent turnaround.

Market position is steady

“Echo has demonstrated modest freight volume growth despite soft economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector where the company derives a good portion of freight activity,” Moody’s said in its report. “Nonetheless, Echo’s credit metrics, including financial leverage and interest coverage, remain weak. Therefore, we believe the company’s financial flexibility is limited until broader freight market conditions improve.”

A summation of Echo Global’s economics said it was a company that had “low profit margin, high leverage, and expectations for modest free cash flow over next 12 months.” But the report also said Moody’s believes Echo Global “will maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity as it continues to navigate a persistently challenging freight trucking environment.”

EBITDA margin: count on 3%

EBITDA margins at Echo Global are usually 3%-5%, Moody’s said. As a point of comparison, RXO (NYSE: RXO), which is a publicly-traded 3PL, reported a second quarter EBITDA margin of 2.7%, compared to 3% a year earlier.

Moody’s sees that 3% EBITDA margin holding in place “as cost saving actions will help offset any margin pressure tied to soft freight rates. Echo Global’s margin also reflects a mix toward less profitable contracted volumes compared to spot volumes.”

Echo Global, Moody’s said, has a “highly variable cost structure that can be flexed during downturns.”

One of the key measurements a ratings agency looks at is a company’s debt to EBITDA margin.

Moody’s said it expects Echo Global’s debt/EBITDA margin to be “slightly below” 7X at the end of t his year, moving to 6.5X next year. By contrast, when S&P Global raised its debt rating on 3PL C.H. Robinson in August, it said the debt to EBITDA ratio in that company was on its way to the mid-1X range.

“(Echo’s) leverage remains very high at this point of the freight cycle with limited cushion to withstand any earnings decline,” the Moody’s rating affirmation said.

Other comments about the company in the Moody’s report were mostly upbeat. Echo, the agency said, “maintains good scale with longstanding relationships and considerable diversity within its customer base (i.e. shippers) and transportation carriers. These relationships, along with solid technology capabilities, have helped Echo increase transportation volumes despite broader market softness.”

Recent ratings actions on 3PLs in the middle of a freight recession have been mixed.

C.H. Robinson’s debt rating was upgraded by S&P Global to BBB+ in August, eight notches above an equivalent comparison to the Echo Global rating. Odyssey Logistics was cut by Moody’s in September. RXO held its rating a year ago when it plunked down a little more than a billion dollars to acquire Coyote Logistics, though its Baa3 rating from Moody’s is investment grade while the BB rating at S&P Global is not.

An email request for comment to Echo Global had not been responded to by publication time.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

META,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

META,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

META,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:53.336959,0.9999999999999999,
META,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

META,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:52.885588,0.9999999999999999,
META,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq mixed as AI optimism blots out US shutdown risks","US stocks rose on Thursday as the AI trade continued to power a push for fresh records amid new buzz around OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

META,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

NFLX,"US stock market today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rise as investors eye tech, healthcare, and AI amid government shutdown concerns","Synopsis

The US stock market showed mostly small gains today despite a government shutdown. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all rose, led by strong tech stocks. Investors stayed hopeful the shutdown won’t last and focused on solid corporate earnings and AI sector growth. Markets paused as key economic data was delayed.

The U.S. stock market showed strength today despite ongoing worries about a government shutdown. Major indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones, all posted gains. Investors are watching closely as technology stocks, healthcare, and economic data shape market direction.

Markets are responding to a mix of political events, corporate performance, and investor sentiment. Even though the federal government is partially shut down, markets remain surprisingly resilient.

Trading today saw early volatility as investors digested news of the ongoing government funding gap. However, buying momentum picked up in the afternoon, particularly in sectors seen as growth drivers for the economy. Technology and healthcare companies led the gains, pushing indexes higher.

Investor confidence is being supported by positive earnings reports from several major tech companies. Strong quarterly results have highlighted revenue growth, new product launches, and increased adoption of AI technologies. These developments are keeping technology stocks attractive even amid political uncertainty.

Healthcare stocks also performed well, with pharmaceutical and biotech companies posting gains. Investors are optimistic about new drug developments and upcoming product approvals. This sector’s resilience provides a safe haven for investors seeking stability during uncertain times.

Live Events

Financials, on the other hand, showed mixed results. Some major banks and investment firms saw slight declines as traders weighed interest rate expectations and potential economic slowdown risks. However, these fluctuations did not significantly impact the broader market trend.

Analysts point out that short-term shutdowns historically have limited impact on financial markets. While federal furloughs affect hundreds of thousands of employees, most essential services continue, and private-sector businesses operate normally, keeping investor confidence intact.

Economic indicators and upcoming data releases remain a major focus for traders. Employment numbers, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve communications could influence market trends in the coming weeks. Investors are carefully watching for signals about future interest rate moves.

Finally, individual stock movements were notable today. Companies like Nvidia and Microsoft drove tech sector gains, while Nike and Caterpillar benefited from strong consumer demand. Meanwhile, some retail and financial stocks faced minor declines, highlighting selective investor activity.

Overall, the market’s performance today demonstrates cautious optimism. Investors are navigating a mix of political and economic uncertainty, yet strong corporate earnings and promising sector trends are keeping U.S. stock indexes on an upward trajectory.

U.S. Stock Market Today

S&P 500: Closed at 6,721.20, up 0.14%, showing steady investor confidence.

Nasdaq Composite: Finished at 22,831.05, up 0.33%, led by technology and AI stocks.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Ended at 46,547.37, a 0.23% gain with mixed blue-chip performance.

The stock market started the day cautiously but gained momentum as trading progressed. The S&P 500 closed slightly higher, signaling steady investor confidence. This marks one of the many record closes the index has seen this year.

The Nasdaq, driven by technology and AI-related stocks, finished with noticeable gains. Tech companies continue to attract attention due to strong earnings and growth potential, helping push the market upward.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day positive, albeit with smaller gains. While blue-chip stocks are generally stable, individual performances varied, with some companies posting higher returns while others fell slightly.

Overall, the market’s mixed but mostly positive performance reflects cautious optimism among investors who are weighing both risks and opportunities.

Top Gainers Today

Nvidia (NVDA): Up 1.59%, driven by strong AI demand and positive earnings.

Microsoft (MSFT): Up 1.45%, boosted by cloud and AI product growth.

Caterpillar (CAT): Up 1.55%, fueled by steady manufacturing and construction activity.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Down 1.36%, facing profit-taking and market caution.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Down 1.28%, affected by interest rate expectations.

Why are investors not worried about the government shutdown?

The U.S. government entered a partial shutdown recently because Congress failed to pass a funding bill. Many people expected this to cause panic in financial markets. Surprisingly, the market remains steady.

Investors know that short-term shutdowns usually do not have a lasting effect on stock prices. Essential government services continue, and financial markets have historically bounced back quickly from such events.

The shutdown has led to temporary furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. However, private companies and major sectors are still operating normally, which helps maintain confidence in the overall economy.

Analysts suggest that while shutdowns are disruptive to daily life, they don’t immediately affect corporate profits or investor sentiment in a meaningful way. That’s why the markets are not reacting drastically.

Top Stocks to Watch in the U.S. Market as of October 2, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA): Leading gains in the tech sector thanks to strong AI growth and robust earnings reports.

Microsoft (MSFT): Powering tech momentum through its cloud services and AI initiatives.

Apple (AAPL): Investors are focused on new product launches and steady consumer demand.

Tesla (TSLA): Key stock to watch with notable EV sales growth and expansion plans.

Amazon (AMZN): Continues to attract investors with strong e-commerce and cloud performance.

Nike (NKE): Stock gains supported by retail strength and brand popularity.

Caterpillar (CAT): Remains in focus due to manufacturing and construction activity.

Walmart (WMT): Investors closely monitoring retail trends and consumer spending for future outlook.

Goldman Sachs (GS): Notable for financial sector movements and interest rate expectations.

Moderna (MRNA): Drawing investor attention with biotech innovations and upcoming product developments.

Which sectors are leading the gains today?

Technology: Tech stocks were among the biggest winners today. Companies developing artificial intelligence, software, and semiconductor products led the charge. Investor interest remains strong as AI innovations promise new growth opportunities.

Healthcare: Healthcare stocks also performed well. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms saw increases as investors anticipate new drug developments and strong earnings reports.

Financials: Financial stocks were mixed. Some banks saw minor losses, while others remained stable. Despite government shutdown concerns, the sector is generally steady, reflecting cautious optimism.

The gains across multiple sectors indicate that investors are selectively choosing strong-performing industries while avoiding areas with higher risk.

How are individual stocks performing?

Some well-known companies had notable movements today:

Nvidia and Microsoft surged as investors remain optimistic about AI and cloud technologies.

Nike and Caterpillar recorded gains thanks to strong retail sales and manufacturing demand.

Walmart and Goldman Sachs saw slight declines, reflecting profit-taking and investor caution in certain sectors.

These movements show that even when overall markets are stable, individual companies can experience significant shifts based on their specific performance, news, and investor sentiment.

What are investors watching next?

Investors are keeping an eye on a few key factors:

Economic Reports: Upcoming job growth and inflation data will guide expectations for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.

Federal Reserve Policy: Any hints about changes to interest rates could significantly influence market trends.

Corporate Earnings: Quarterly earnings reports are expected to continue driving investor decisions, especially in technology and healthcare.

By monitoring these areas, investors aim to make informed choices about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

Will the shutdown affect the economy?

While the government shutdown may seem alarming, its immediate effect on the economy is limited. Essential services continue to operate, and the private sector remains active.

Historically, brief shutdowns have not caused long-term market damage. Investors are confident that any disruptions will be temporary, and markets tend to recover quickly once funding resumes.

The shutdown may, however, delay some data releases, such as economic indicators or government reports. This can create temporary uncertainty, but it does not usually alter long-term investment trends.

What can investors learn from today’s market?

Today’s market activity highlights several lessons for investors:

Stay Calm During Political Uncertainty: Markets often recover quickly from government-related events.

Focus on Strong Sectors: Technology and healthcare are showing resilience and growth potential.

Watch Corporate Performance: Individual companies can outperform even if the broader market is flat.

Consider Economic Trends: Interest rates and employment data remain key indicators for investment strategy.

By following these principles, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning themselves for potential gains.

NFLX,"S&P 500 hits record high despite government shutdown: Nvidia shares reach all-time high; Magnificent Seven including AMD, SK Hynix soar on AI frenzy while Tesla falters — what’s driving Wall Street today","Synopsis

S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high on October 2, 2025, rising about 0.1% as investors. The market optimism is largely driven by the technology sector. Nvidia shares reached an all-time high. Other major AI-focused tech companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" are also reporting solid quarterly earnings.

S&P 500 reached a new all-time high on Thursday, shrugging off concerns over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Investors focused on strong tech earnings, AI excitement, and expectations of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts. At the open, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 49 points, or 0.1%.

Wednesday’s session also saw record closes. The S&P 500 finished above 6,700 for the first time. This marked the 29th record close of the year.

Major tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet are leading the gains, as investors believe AI will continue to be a significant growth engine. This optimism is helping offset concerns about the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and slower job growth.

Nvidia leads among them with a 1.43% gain and a price near $189.92, driven by AI optimism. AMD is trading near $110.45, up about 2.1%, and SK Hynix is trading around 137,000 KRW, up roughly 1.5%. All three stocks have shown positive performance fueled by optimism in the tech and AI sectors.

Investors are also encouraged by weaker-than-expected private payroll data from the ADP report, which increased expectations for imminent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. There is reportedly about a 99% likelihood of a rate cut later this month, fueling further market confidence.

Live Events

Besides the tech and AI sector strength, healthcare stocks and some auto sector gains (e.g., Tesla and Stellantis) contributed positively. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags somewhat due to pressure on cyclical sectors sensitive to government spending delays and consumer activity uncertainty.

Nvidia leads AI rally

Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to $188.59, up 0.7%, reaching an intraday high of $190.94. The AI chipmaker remains the star of the market as investors bet on generative AI growth.

AMD gained 2.1% to $167.41, supported by strong demand for data center and AI chips. Its intraday range was $165.20–$170.23.

SK Hynix surged nearly 12% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, signaling the company’s growing role in powering AI technologies.

SK Hynix is a leading global semiconductor company, particularly dominant in the DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market, holding about 36% market share as of early 2025—surpassing Samsung for the first time in DRAM sales. The company also has a commanding 70% share in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) segment, crucial for AI applications. SK Hynix reported strong Q2 2025 financials with record revenues of 22.232 trillion won and operating profit of 9.2129 trillion won, driven by brisk sales of AI memory products.

Tesla falters despite strong deliveries

Tesla (TSLA) traded at $457.97, down 0.3%. The stock opened around $470 and reached a high of $477.64.

Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in Q3, beating Wall Street’s forecast of 447,600. Deliveries rose 7% year-over-year, boosted by buyers rushing to claim the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit.

Analysts remain split. Some, like Wedbush, raised their price target to $600, citing AI, autonomous vehicle, and robotics growth. Others warn about valuation risks, falling European sales, and stronger competition from Chinese EV makers.

Government shutdown and economic impact

The U.S. government shutdown began after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on funding by Tuesday. The impasse is expected to last at least several days.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the shutdown could hurt U.S. growth. “We could see a hit to GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America,” he said.

The Labor Department has paused most activities, meaning key economic reports, including September’s nonfarm payrolls, will not be released on Friday.

Why Wall Street is still rallying

Wall Street is still rallying despite the U.S. government shutdown and weaker job data because investors remain optimistic about several key factors. First, there is broad belief that the government shutdown will be brief and have limited long-term economic impact, as markets have historically shrugged off such events. This has helped maintain positive sentiment.

Second, there is strong enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, with technology stocks—especially AI leaders like Nvidia—continuing to soar due to solid earnings and growth prospects, fueling a major part of the rally.

Third, the market is pricing in near-certain Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this month following disappointing private payroll job numbers, which boosts investor confidence in easier monetary policy ahead.

Finally, healthcare stocks have also contributed positively, supported by agreements that lower drug prices and strong earnings from major pharma companies.

Overall, the rally reflects investors looking past short-term political disruptions toward sustained corporate earnings growth, AI-related optimism, and supportive Fed policies.

NFLX,Unpacking EA's $55 Billion Sale To Go Private: What Does It All Mean?,"In a shocking development, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.

Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and the list goes on from there.

There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.

First off, what is a leveraged buyout?

EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not you who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.

$20 billion in debt

The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.

Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to ""enhance EA's mobile business"" to help reach the goal.

Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns

The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of human rights violations, as well.

Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as ""sportswashing""--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.

As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.

Are layoffs coming?

When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to ""cut costs"" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).

Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. ""I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations,"" Barr said.

Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. ""There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall,"" Barr said.

A filing specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, ""Will private ownership lead to layoffs?"" The answer was, ""There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction."" It added that the investor consortium buying EA is ""supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture,"" noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be ""no immediate changes"" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.

Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said EA may look to ""cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce"" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A report from Financial Times said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.

""Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to ""cultural differences"" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.

History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.

Mat Piscatella of Circana told GI.biz that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. ""Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies,"" he said.

Concerns at BioWare

A report from Insider Gaming cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.

""I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs,"" a current BioWare developer said. ""Kind of feels like a matter of time.""

BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as 2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, ""We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done."" They added: ""It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.""

BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, speculated that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid ""gay stuff"" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.

The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the reported restrictions on what the comedians could say pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant Bill Burr said this was overblown, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.

PIF could be a ""hands-off"" owner

The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company ""experienced no relocation or mass layoffs"" from the buyout. ""The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires,"" Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.

""Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition,"" Barr said.

One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is ""relatively underdeveloped"" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.

""A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments,"" he said.

A ""step change"" for the PIF

Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a ""step change in commitment,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises,"" he explained.

Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.

""EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance,"" Harding-Rolls said. ""EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports.""

Saudi Arabia previously outlined a ""Vision 2030"" plan to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.

A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.

""While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry,"" Harding-Rolls said.

Not a done deal yet

To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to ""customary closing conditions,"" including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.

Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' Committee on Foreign Investment, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.

Further obfuscation of key data points

Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a ""knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally."" Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.

""I'd be really excited,"" former EA dev says of going private

Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with GI.biz that, ""I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail."" Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.

""However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design,"" she said. ""You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate.""

""EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time,"" she added.

Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on ""long-term strategies and investments."" Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.

Could another company swoop in to buy EA?

As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.

""The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop,"" he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.

NFLX,Echo Global keeps Moody’s B3 rating in tough market,"Outlook for the future is for steady performance but little chance of a big turnaround

Echo Global Logistics has managed to hold its debt rating at Moody’s as the ratings agency said it expects the company, even in the midst of the current freight market, to “maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity.”

The corporate family rating at Moody’s for Echo Global was maintained at B3. That rating is considered equivalent to a B- at S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) has had Echo Global at that level for approximately two years after a downgrade.

Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) also affirmed Echo’s probability of default rating at B3-PD and senior secured bank credit facilities rating at B2, a notch higher than the corporate family rating.

The ratings agency also held the company’s outlook at stable.

Six notches deep

Both the Moody’s B3 rating and an S&P B- rating are six notches into non-investment grade territory.

Echo Global has been in the public debt markets for approximately four years. Moody’s gave it a B2 rating when Echo Global first issued publicly traded debt, and downgraded it to B3 in November 2023, not long after S&P Global had made its downward shift.

Its move into debt markets came after the once publicly-traded company announced its acquisition by The Jordan Co.

While the Moody’s report does not provide any figures on revenue or profitability, which is standard practice, its general comments suggest a 3PL that is holding its own in the current freight market but with only a small chance of an imminent turnaround.

Market position is steady

“Echo has demonstrated modest freight volume growth despite soft economic conditions, particularly in the manufacturing sector where the company derives a good portion of freight activity,” Moody’s said in its report. “Nonetheless, Echo’s credit metrics, including financial leverage and interest coverage, remain weak. Therefore, we believe the company’s financial flexibility is limited until broader freight market conditions improve.”

A summation of Echo Global’s economics said it was a company that had “low profit margin, high leverage, and expectations for modest free cash flow over next 12 months.” But the report also said Moody’s believes Echo Global “will maintain steady earnings and adequate liquidity as it continues to navigate a persistently challenging freight trucking environment.”

EBITDA margin: count on 3%

EBITDA margins at Echo Global are usually 3%-5%, Moody’s said. As a point of comparison, RXO (NYSE: RXO), which is a publicly-traded 3PL, reported a second quarter EBITDA margin of 2.7%, compared to 3% a year earlier.

Moody’s sees that 3% EBITDA margin holding in place “as cost saving actions will help offset any margin pressure tied to soft freight rates. Echo Global’s margin also reflects a mix toward less profitable contracted volumes compared to spot volumes.”

Echo Global, Moody’s said, has a “highly variable cost structure that can be flexed during downturns.”

One of the key measurements a ratings agency looks at is a company’s debt to EBITDA margin.

Moody’s said it expects Echo Global’s debt/EBITDA margin to be “slightly below” 7X at the end of t his year, moving to 6.5X next year. By contrast, when S&P Global raised its debt rating on 3PL C.H. Robinson in August, it said the debt to EBITDA ratio in that company was on its way to the mid-1X range.

“(Echo’s) leverage remains very high at this point of the freight cycle with limited cushion to withstand any earnings decline,” the Moody’s rating affirmation said.

Other comments about the company in the Moody’s report were mostly upbeat. Echo, the agency said, “maintains good scale with longstanding relationships and considerable diversity within its customer base (i.e. shippers) and transportation carriers. These relationships, along with solid technology capabilities, have helped Echo increase transportation volumes despite broader market softness.”

Recent ratings actions on 3PLs in the middle of a freight recession have been mixed.

C.H. Robinson’s debt rating was upgraded by S&P Global to BBB+ in August, eight notches above an equivalent comparison to the Echo Global rating. Odyssey Logistics was cut by Moody’s in September. RXO held its rating a year ago when it plunked down a little more than a billion dollars to acquire Coyote Logistics, though its Baa3 rating from Moody’s is investment grade while the BB rating at S&P Global is not.

An email request for comment to Echo Global had not been responded to by publication time.

Algoma expects to lose $80 million to $90 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter, the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company said in a late Wednesday statement. Shipments in the quarter are expected to be between 415,000 and 420,000 net tons. The guidance shows further declines in shipments and widening losses compared to both the second quarter and year-earlier period.

Article content

Canadian steel companies have been struggling since United States President Donald Trump imposed 50 per cent import tariffs on steel earlier this year. Algoma has been particularly hard hit, as the U.S. market accounted for about 60 per cent of its business last year. The company received $500 million in government loans this week to help offset the impacts of tariffs, though ongoing trade headwinds persist.

NFLX,PYMNTS Tariff Tally Shows Which S&P 500 Firms Are Bleeding Billions of Dollars,"Over 2,000 publicly traded companies in the United States mentioned tariffs during their quarterly earnings calls this year, the most in recorded history, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to estimates from JPMorgan, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. now stands at nearly 16%, up from 2.3% at the end of last year.

As sectoral tariffs continue to be imposed, the bank projected that the effective U.S. tariff rate will approach 18% to 20% by the end of the year.

The drumbeat of trade announcements from the U.S. White House, as well as other nations, has resulted in an economic drag widespread and sector-specific, shaping margins, pricing strategies and capital allocation decisions across the market.

These aren’t just penny stocks. For the S&P 500, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from overseas markets, the duties represent not an episodic compliance exercise but a core dimension of competitive strategy.

Blue-chip companies like Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Nike, Kraft Heinz, FedEx and Apple each reported 9- to 10-figure headwinds due to tariffs during their most recent earnings calls.

Executives repeatedly flagged two intertwined themes on their calls. The first was that tariff exposure is sticky rather than transient, reflecting entrenched supply chain dependencies. The second was that the pricing power required to offset tariffs is unevenly distributed across industries.

As a result, some sectors pass costs along to consumers quickly, while others absorb them in margins or scramble to reroute supply lines.

Tariffs as a Structural Cost Lead to Uneven Exposure, Common Anxiety

The automotive sector has become a bellwether for tariff pressure because its global production networks are tightly interwoven. Ford said it expects a higher-than-expected tariff hit of $2 billion for 2025, while GM maintained a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.

Both companies signaled plans to accelerate supplier diversification and regionalize certain assembly operations but acknowledged that these shifts will take multiple years to yield cost relief.

“[W]e are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact, with roughly one-third coming from each of our key actions, manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing,” GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July.

Tesla estimated a $200 million hit from tariffs for 2025. On the European front, Jeep maker Stellantis’ North America shipments dropped 25% year over year in the second quarter.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “What Uncertainty Means: U.S. Goods Firms Retool Product Plans Amid Tariffs” found that nearly 1 in 4 product leaders said they switched up their product design, pricing or go-to-market strategy in response to tariffs. This is not a mere reshuffling of SKUs but a fundamental rethinking of what gets made, where and for whom.

Tariffs Evolve From Temporary Headwind to Strategic Variable

In consumer-facing sectors, the tariff debate often turns on elasticity of demand. Nike said its business will likely take a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs, up from an estimated $1 billion.

Hasbro said on its first-quarter earnings call in April that tariffs remain a hurdle but will cost less than expected. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during the call that the company is accelerating a “$1 billion cost-savings plan to offset tariff pressures internally.”

When Kraft Heinz reported second-quarter earnings in July, it lowered full-year guidance, highlighting that tariffs are expected to affect the company’s financial performance by approximately 100 basis points this year. It also announced that it is splitting into two companies.

Procter & Gamble said during its fourth-quarter earnings report in July that tariffs are projected to cost the company $1 billion before tax for fiscal year 2026. FedEx said Sept. 18 that it faces a $1 billion headwind in its current fiscal year due to the global trade environment.

For the technology sector, tariffs collide directly with ongoing supply chain reshuffling. Apple reported headwinds nearing the multibillion-dollar range. In the next quarter alone, the technology giant predicts tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion.

For enterprise and industrial players, the math is more complex. B2B contracts are often multi-year and volume-based, with negotiated escalation clauses, and companies must decide how much of the tariff burden to absorb, how much to pass through, and how much to renegotiate. These shifts can require reworking supplier agreements, rethinking geographical sourcing and reshaping logistics footprints, all under the glare of investor expectations and fixed-horizon margins.

NFLX,Tesla Stock Is Down Today After Upbeat Deliveries News—And a Long Upward Run,"Tesla's stock isn't having a big day today. Given its recent performance, it can probably be excused.

Shares of the Magnificent Seven stock and electric vehicle maker were down more than 3% in recent trading as the broader tech sector rose, and after reporting third-quarter deliveries that, at 497,000, exceeded Wall Street's expectations as measured by Visible Alpha. (The mean forecast was around 440,000; it's generally believed that the expiration of federal subsidies has pulled some EV demand forward.) Tesla's third-quarter earnings are now set to land Oct. 22.

Given the outperformance, one might have expected a more dramatic reaction to the deliveries news—though Tesla's (TSLA) shares have been delivering for a while now. The stock has powered off 2025 lows seen in March, turning in the best third-quarter performance of any Magnificent Seven stock with a 40% climb.

That's happened as CEO Elon Musk has encouraged investors to look toward its developing business lines, including robotaxis, autonomous driving systems, and robotics, as the more important drivers of the company's value than auto sales. (Some of the incentives in Musk's massive proposed pay package point in that direction, too—though he's already doing pretty well.) Reports indicate that Tesla will expand its robotaxi trials to another state.

Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have been gradually lifting their price targets—though the average, according to Visible Alpha, is still roughly $100 below current prices. Wedbush's Dan Ives, among the biggest bulls around, on Thursday said an ""AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next 6-9 months has now begun.""

Investors have been buying in—even if today's modest move doesn't show it.

NFLX,Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?,"Gold has been one of the most closely watched assets this year, and for good reason. The price of gold has surged to fresh highs multiple times in 2025, the uptick driven, in large part, by a mix of global uncertainty, strong central bank buying and other economic pressures. As a result, investors who bought physical gold earlier this year have already seen meaningful gains, making it one of the standout performers compared to more traditional investments.

But timing any investment is tricky — especially an investment like gold, which has a reputation for short-term price volatility. And, while some potential investors may argue against buying in at today's prices, considering that gold is expensive right now, others believe it still has room to run as the economic backdrop remains unsettled. That leaves a pressing question to answer: Are gold bars and coins a smart move this October, or should you hold off? That's what we'll analyze below.

Learn how to add gold to your investment portfolio today.

Are gold bars and coins a smart investment this October?

The short answer to whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment right now depends largely on your financial goals and risk tolerance. However, there's a compelling case to be made for including physical gold in your portfolio right now.

Whether you're looking at gold bars, coins or other forms of bullion, several economic forces are aligning to make gold an attractive option for investors seeking stability and growth potential. Here are a few key reasons why gold deserves serious consideration this month:

The price of gold continues to break records

Gold has soared to numerous all-time highs throughout 2025, and is currently sitting just under $3,900 per ounce, which would be another record high for the precious metal. When an asset reaches unprecedented price levels like these, conventional wisdom might suggest staying away. But with gold, record highs can actually signal continued momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Analysts are projecting that gold could climb to $4,000 per ounce (or higher) by the end of 2025, suggesting there's still meaningful upside potential from current levels.

This matters for two reasons: First, the type of momentum that we're seeing behind gold right now tends to attract more buyers, which can push prices higher in the short term. Second, gold's historical pattern shows that strong rallies can last for months or even years when conditions line up, particularly when central banks and governments are driving demand.

So, if you're considering physical gold in the form of bars or coins, this environment could provide an opportunity to capitalize on continued price growth. And, while gold is hovering just under the $3,900 price point, this could be the best time to buy in. After all, if the price continues on its upward trajectory, you'll just end up paying more per ounce when you do eventually invest in the future.

Start narrowing down your gold investing options online now.

Inflation is still rising

The latest annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% in August 2025, up slightly from 2.7% in July. This rise in inflation demonstrates how price pressures remain stubborn despite efforts to cool the economy. And, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, stands at 3.1%, which is still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

This persistent and rising inflation creates real problems for anyone who's holding cash or fixed-income investments, as purchasing power gradually erodes over time amid sticky inflation issues. Gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, though, precisely because the precious metal tends to maintain its value even as paper currencies lose theirs.

Unlike stocks, which can suffer during inflationary periods, or bonds, which get hammered by rising rates, gold often thrives when traditional investments struggle. The current environment, where inflation refuses to cooperate with central bank targets, is exactly the scenario where gold typically shines brightest, meaning that investing in gold bars and coins could pay off right now.

Portfolio diversification is necessary in today's landscape

Beyond inflation, today's broader financial landscape is fraught with risks. Markets remain on edge, geopolitical tensions continue to rattle global trade and many analysts expect heightened volatility heading into the new year. These uncertainties make portfolio diversification more important for investors.

And, that's where gold bars and coins come in. This type of gold investment can serve as a form of insurance. These physical gold assets are not tied to corporate earnings or government debt, and they can act as a safe harbor during financial shocks. The current government shutdown only underscores this point, serving as a reminder of how quickly political gridlock can spill into markets and erode confidence.

For long-term investors, holding some physical gold can diversify a portfolio that may be heavily weighted toward equities or bonds. While gold doesn't generate income like stocks or bonds do, its role as a stabilizer during turbulent times has been proven repeatedly.

The bottom line

Gold bars and coins are not a perfect investment. They can be costly to buy and store, and prices can swing dramatically in the short term. But this October, the combination of record-breaking gold prices, persistent inflation and a volatile economic environment makes them worth serious consideration. If you're evaluating whether to invest in gold this way, remember that the focus should be on finding the right balance. Don't bet your entire portfolio on gold, but consider whether a measured allocation could give you peace of mind and protection against the risks ahead.",CBS News,2025-10-02T14:54:07Z,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-gold-bars-and-coins-a-smart-investment-october-2025/,0.4,2025-10-04 00:20:59.965939,0.9999999999999999,
NFLX,Pepsi's chips empire is losing its shine,"PepsiCo's (PEP) crown jewel isn't as bright as it used to be.

RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi recently wrote in a note to clients that the company's biggest challenge is its Frito-Lay snacks division — not bottling or cost cuts.

""Frito-Lay has 3 main issues: 1) price points, 2) under indexed to growing parts of the snacking wheel and 3) lack of exposure to protein,"" Modi wrote. ""Fixing these issues will take time, capital and or reinvestments that could dilute EPS and/or returns.""

Year to date, Pepsi stock has slipped nearly 6%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 14% jump.

Modi's cautious view comes as PepsiCo fends off activist pressure. In early September, Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, pushing for brand innovation and efficiency. Those changes could boost PepsiCo's share price by 50%, the activist investor group said.

While those moves could free up cash, Modi argued they don't solve Pepsi's most pressing problem: sluggish snack demand.

He noted that the division was once considered one of the ""most advantaged assets in CPG."" Frito-Lay grew at an 8% compound annual rate from 2019 to 2023, but volumes have remained flat for two years, per Modi. And consumers are balking after double-digit percentage price increases.

""Frito's biggest issue is one of affordability (especially for low/middle income consumers),"" Modi wrote. Sales of family-size bags have dragged the most, while single-serve packs are still growing, signaling that consumers are still seeking out the company's chips, albeit more selectively.

A Numerator survey cited by RBC showed price hikes were the No. 1 reason consumers stopped buying chips across all income groups.

PepsiCo has other problems too. The second is its concentration in salty snacks, which make up about 90% of Frito-Lay's volumes. That's a headwind as shoppers shift to healthier bars, meat snacks, and protein-rich options, per Modi. Protein-based snacks now account for about 13% of the aisle, but PepsiCo's exposure remains at just 1%.

That leaves Pepsi facing tough choices: either cut prices and sacrifice earnings in the near term, or risk ceding more ground to rivals like Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Goldfish producer Campbell's (CPB).

""We believe 'ripping the band-aid off' and committing to lowering pricing in snacking would be a hit to earnings but ultimately be well perceived by investors as a step in the right direction to spur volume growth,"" Modi wrote.

Meanwhile, Pepsi's beverage unit has its own issues. The company continues to lose share to Coca-Cola (KO), with RBC suggesting that refranchising bottling operations in North America could help. But the path forward in snacks remains the key swing factor.

Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein struck a similar tone.

""While PEP looks cheap vs. history and may have found a bottom, we continue to worry it may move sideways until we see growth in the U.S, which likely relies on success of upcoming innovation in permissible foods, including protein solutions ... as well as more on-the-go / portioned offerings,"" he wrote.

Ottenstein noted that Pepsi, ""once known for hitting and beating estimates,"" has cut guidance several times since 2024 as weak consumer demand, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, tariffs, and food stamp reductions weigh on results.

Like Modi, Ottenstein also pointed to the Elliott-driven debate over refranchising bottling operations, saying investors should expect more detail on that front when Pepsi reports third quarter earnings next week before markets open.

NFLX,Tesla shatters vehicle sales record as it clears inventory to beat analyst expectations,"Tesla reported a record amount of 497,099 vehicles delivered in Q3 as buyers snatched any Model Y or Model 3 it could make before the federal tax credit expiration deadline. This includes clearing all inventory units as well, since Tesla was only able to manufacture 447,000 vehicles in Q3.

The Model Y and Model 3 accounted for nearly 97% of all Tesla deliveries and were in such high demand that it had to raise lease prices mid-quarter and cut some incentives and promos it had started at its beginning.

Bloomberg analysts expected that Tesla will deliver way fewer vehicles in Q3 - 439,600 units on average - but the tax credit expiration alone proved the most robust incentive as it took $7,500 off the price of a vehicle at the point of sale directly. Tesla managed to beat its deliveries by 7.4% year-on-year, quite the respite in a year marred by unrelenting sales and profit drop due to Elon Musk's political activism and a softer EV market.

Tesla has seemingly managed to take full advantage of the federal subsidy expiration boost, postponing some expected new releases for the holiday quarter when it no longer enjoys the government's largesse. It will also face a more fierce competition by the likes of Hyundai, which just started a price war by lowering the tag of its Model Y competitor, the 2026 Ioniq 5, by up to $9.800.

To offset the tax credit loss for its customers in Q4, Tesla introduced a $6,500 lease credit and will be riding on the wings of two fresh Model Y versions. On the top end, it released the 2026 Model Y Performance trim on the eve of the tax credit expiration deadline, allowing early adopters to still order and get advantage of the $7,500 discount, while throwing in free colors, interior, and tow package for those who couldn't order by September 30.

In addition, Tesla has now entered mass production of the cheapest Model Y trim that should be released soon at a price comparable to what its bestselling vehicle used to cost with the tax credit discount. Whether or not a cheaper, stripped down Model Y will be a sales success remains to be seen though, as a similar move with the RWD Cybertruck didn't pan out as Tesla intended, and it deprecated the trim rather quietly.

Tesla will report its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22, and there should be more details on how has its sales record been reflected in the operating profit, as well as on its future vehicle release plans.",Notebookcheck.net,2025-10-02T15:40:00Z,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Tesla-shatters-vehicle-sales-record-as-it-clears-inventory-to-beat-analyst-expectations.1130190.0.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:20:59.605691,0.9999999999999999,

NFLX,"Vital economic data, including Friday’s jobs report, cut off in government shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government’s monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays — will also be postponed.

If the shutdown is short-lived, it won’t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.

The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it — or at least leaves it unchanged — when inflation is rising too quickly. It’s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.

“The job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,” said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “It would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.”

READ MORE: Fed’s favored inflation gauge accelerated slightly in August, report shows

The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.

A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government’s monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.

“We’re in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we’re going to be looking at the data,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.

READ MORE: What to know about the Fed’s rate cut and mortgage rates

The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.

A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday’s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.

On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It’s a crucial indicator of the economy’s health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.

WATCH: Chicago Fed president unpacks weak jobs report and what it says about the economy

So far, investors don’t seem fazed by the shutdown. The broad S&P 500 stock index rose slightly Wednesday to an all-time high.

Many businesses also rely on government data to gauge how the economy is faring. The Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales, for example, is a comprehensive look at the health of U.S. consumers and can influence whether companies make plans to expand or shrink their operations and workforces.

For the time being, the Fed, economists, and investors will likely focus more on private data.

On Wednesday, the payroll provider ADP issued its monthly employment data, which showed that businesses cut 32,000 jobs in September — a signal the economy is slowing. Still, ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said her firm’s report “was not intended to be a replacement” for government statistics.

The ADP data does not capture what’s happening at government agencies, for example — an area of the economy that could be significantly affected by a lengthy shutdown.

“Using a portfolio of private sector and government data gives you a better chance of capturing a very complicated economy in a complex world,” she said.

The Fed will remain open no matter how long the shutdown lasts, because it funds itself from earnings on the government bonds and other securities it owns. It will continue to provide its monthly snapshots of industrial production, which includes mining, manufacturing, and utility output. The next industrial production report will be released Oct. 17.

AAPL,Buffett's Insight: How Price and Value Differ in the Investment World,"Defining Price vs. Value

Warren Buffett draws a sharp distinction between a stock's current market price and its long-term value. Other investors can benefit from understanding the distinction that Buffett sees. When we talk about price, we refer to the current market trading cost of a stock. It’s the amount a buyer is willing to pay or a seller is asking in a transaction. The amount of money one share is trading at is its share price. But that market price fluctuates every second based on supply, demand, and sentiment.

Value is the company’s overall true worth based on its assets, earnings, and prospects. It is best to look at it this way: price is a tag on the stock, while value reflects what the business actually produces and its potential. Intrinsic value often stems from fundamentals such as consistent profits, a high growth rate, a competitive moat, and strong management. Buffett and other value investors try to estimate this worth (for example, via discounted cash flows or owner earnings) and compare it to the market price. Because fundamentals change slowly, true value tends to be steadier than the wild swings of daily price.

Why Investors Confuse the Two

It’s human nature to get swept up in market drama. When a stock rockets 50% in a day, many jump in hoping to ride the wave. When a stock drops, many traders panic-sell. However, these knee-jerk moves often fail to consider business reality—how the business is actually performing and its outlook over a relevant time period. Often, investors rush into or out of a stock due to fear, greed, or herd mentality. Those emotions can drive prices far above or below a stock’s intrinsic value.

Sometimes, those dramatic, sudden share-price moves are driven by investors discussing a ticker and the news affecting it. ""Talking"" can involve conversation around the office water-cooler. It can also involve social media. Whatever form it takes, hype can overshadow company fundamentals. Financial news and online influencers amplify this effect. Headlines end up focusing on what’s hot instead of what’s solid in terms of fundamentals and prospects. The result very often is that many retail investors mistake a soaring price for a great value, only to suffer when the bubble bursts. Regulators remind us that such market swings are inevitable and that trendy trades can be extremely volatile. In a roller-coaster market, it’s easy to lose sight of the underlying business activity, results, and potential. And this is exactly what Buffett warns against.

Buffett’s Value Investing Approach

Buffett admits that his strategy was inherited from his mentor Ben Graham, and it involves looking for great businesses selling below their intrinsic value. He demands a margin of safety—meaning he aims to avoid overpaying. As Buffett put it, high prices had “materially eroded the ‘margin of safety’ that Ben Graham identified as the cornerstone of intelligent investing.""

In practice, Buffett buys companies with durable competitive advantages (economic moats) run by competent owners. He studies annual reports and earnings, not stock charts. As he says, he and Charlie Munger view themselves “as business analysts—not as market analysts.""

Two of his famous rules capture this thinking: “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes,” and “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

In short, Buffett buys quality, then holds on and lets that value compound over time.

Examples

Buffett started buying Coca-Cola (KO) in 1988 at prices he believed were well below its true value. Today Coke is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holdings. Similarly, Buffett’s big Apple position grew massively as the tech giant kept delivering profits, which translated into rising share price and dividends. Berkshire’s equity portfolio is famously concentrated in blue-chip names like Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola—all companies with strong fundamentals, in Buffett's view.

AAPL,"Performance Comparison: Apple And Competitors In Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals Industry - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)","In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business world, it is crucial for investors and industry followers to conduct comprehensive company evaluations. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in relation to its major competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and highlight company's performance in the industry.

Apple Background

Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.

When closely examining Apple, the following trends emerge:

With a Price to Earnings ratio of 39.02, which is 0.74x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants.

The elevated Price to Book ratio of 57.97 relative to the industry average by 5.67x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.

The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 9.5, surpassing the industry average by 2.68x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.

The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 35.34%, which is 29.55% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.

The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $31.03 Billion, which is 86.19x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.

Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $43.72 Billion, which indicates 47.01x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

The company is experiencing remarkable revenue growth, with a rate of 9.63%, outperforming the industry average of 7.09%.

Debt To Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities.

Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.

When evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:

Apple falls in the middle of the list when considering the debt-to-equity ratio.

This indicates that the company has a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.54, suggesting a balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equitymix.

Key Takeaways

For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The PB and PS ratios are high, suggesting overvaluation relative to industry standards. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth, Apple demonstrates strong performance compared to its industry peers, reflecting robust financial health and growth potential.

AAPL,Our Plan For The Shutdown - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Epic Bull Market

Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).

Note the following:

The chart of SPY is a quarterly chart to give you a long term picture.

The chart shows in 2007 our Protection Band was at 100%. The chart shows that the stock market subsequently fell 50%.

The chart shows our back up the truck and buy signal was given on March 9, 2009. At the time of the signal, it was a bold call. With the benefit of hindsight, March 9, 2009 turned out to be the start of an epic bull market.

The chart shows that the stock market has risen 10X since our back up the truck and buy signal.

Prudent investors should pay attention to the comparison between 2007, 2009, and now.

Sentiment

In 2007, sentiment was extremely positive. Greed was dominant, and fear did not exist.

In 2009, sentiment was extremely negative. Fear was dominant, and greed did not exist.

In 2025, sentiment is extremely positive. Greed is dominant, and fear is minimal.

Wall Street

In 2007, Wall Street was very positive and raising targets.

In 2009, Wall Street was very negative and lowering targets.

In 2025, Wall Street is very positive and raising targets.

Momo Crowd

In 2007, the momo crowd was the dominant force in buying stocks.

In 2009, the momo crowd was the dominant force in selling stocks.

In 2025, the momo crowd is the dominant force in buying stocks.

Smart Money

In 2007, smart money was selling stocks.

In 2009, smart money was aggressively buying stocks.

In 2025, smart money is slowing trimming stocks.

Here is our analysis:

When conditions are similar to 2007, prudent investors should be 100% hedged on long positions, buying inverse ETFs, and short selling aggressively.

When conditions are similar to 2009, prudent investors should be aggressively buying strategic positions.

Under current market conditions, prudent investors should be holding good strategic positions, starting new strategic positions only on pullbacks, and focusing on special situations as well as tactical positions.

Due to the government shutdown, the jobs report is not available today.

So far, the government shutdown has been overshadowed by massive AI deals. As an example, please see yesterday's Morning Capsule regarding the massive memory deal.

In our analysis, if the government shutdown lasts longer, the stock market may start noticing. The plan continues to be to buy stocks on any dip.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows

Most portfolios are now heavily concentrated in the Mag 7 stocks. For this reason, to get ahead and get an edge, investors need to dig below the surface of the Mag 7 stocks. It is equally important to rise above the noise of daily news on the Mag 7 stocks. The best way to get an edge, dig below the surface, and rise above the noise of the daily news is to pay attention to early money flows in the Mag 7 stocks on a daily basis. When there is significant news in the Mag 7 stocks that rises above the threshold of noise and impacts your entire portfolio, it is covered in the main section above.

In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).

Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).

Bitcoin

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.",Benzinga,2025-10-03T15:30:21Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48020004/our-plan-for-the-shutdown,0.7,2025-10-04 00:21:01.796478,,0.192156862745098
AAPL,"Apple App Store Revenue Jumps 10%, Analyst Sees AI, App Diversification Driving Long-Term Growth - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)","Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store delivered strong results in the September quarter, with revenue climbing 10% year-over-year to $8.7 billion and downloads rising 2.5% to 9 billion.

AAPL stock is up today. Get the details here.

The company also saw stronger monetization and a shift in revenue mix, as gaming's share declined while categories such as Productivity and Photo & Video posted steady growth, signaling healthier long-term trends alongside rising demand for artificial intelligence-powered apps.

BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple with a price target of $270.

Also Read: Apple Services Revenue Trajectory Signals Softness With Weaker App Store Downloads: Analyst

Mohan highlighted Apple’s strength in the App Store during the September quarter, including robust revenue growth, a healthier mix shift, and promising long-term trends tied to AI and app diversification.

The analyst noted App Store revenue rose 10% year-over-year in Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, reaching $8.7 billion, according to developer revenue data from SensorTower. Total downloads across iPhone and iPad grew 2.5% year-over-year to nine billion during the same period, he noted.

Mohan emphasized that dollars per download increased 7.3% year-over-year to 97 cents, showing stronger monetization. For September alone, revenue rose 7% year-over-year, outpacing the 3% growth in downloads, the analyst said.

He cited strong capital returns, Apple’s eventual leadership in AI at the edge and optionality from new products and markets.

Mohan also noted the revenue mix continues to shift away from gaming, which bodes well for Apple’s long-term Services revenue. In the fourth quarter, games accounted for 45% of App Store revenue by category, down from historic levels above 50%, the analyst told. Productivity apps gained roughly 300 basis points year over year, the most significant growth among categories, he said.

While gaming remains the dominant contributor, Mohan viewed steady growth in categories such as Productivity and Photo & Video as constructive, since this diversification should support sustainable revenue growth. The analyst flagged Apple’s upcoming Oct. 21 appeal hearing in the Epic Games case as another key event for the App Store business.

On the AI front, he underscored how search-oriented AI apps are increasingly capturing daily active user share from the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google search app (excluding Safari and Siri).

Google’s app share slipped to 73% in September, down from 85% in January, Mohan noted. ChatGPT emerged as the biggest beneficiary, with its share increasing from 14% in January to 24% in August, according to the analyst.

Mohan highlighted how ChatGPT has successfully monetized its user base, with App Store revenue rising from about $10 million in January 2024 to roughly $215 million in September 2025.

Mohan projected fiscal 2025 sales of $416.04 billion and EPS of $7.39.

AAPL Price Action: Apple shares were up 0.46% at $258.32 at publication on Friday.

Shares of Apple Inc. have inched into positive territory this year following the launch of its new iPhone 17 devices. Maintaining that trajectory won’t be an easy feat.
Demand for Apple’s AAPL new phones has been hotter than expected, leading to higher expectations for next year’s iPhone 18 and the overall device upgrade cycle — which Jefferies analyst Edison Lee thinks will be tough for the company to meet.

AAPL,"Stellantis, Ford, GM Clash Over Trump Truck Tariffs Amid Lobbying Efforts: Report","The ‘Detroit Big Three’ – Stellantis NV (STLA), General Motors (GM), and Ford (F) – are reportedly locked in a last-minute lobbying push over potential Trump administration tariffs on medium and heavy-duty trucks.

Add Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source

According to a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, Stellantis has sought a waiver or at least a reduction on a potential 25% tariff that could affect its medium-duty Ram pickups produced in Mexico. It added that the company’s lobbying efforts have intensified in recent days.

STLA’s stock rose 1.4% in midday trade, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘bullish’ territory. However, chatter fell to ‘normal’ from ‘high’ levels over the past day.

The report stated that General Motors and Ford have urged officials to deny Stellantis’s request. Ford has argued that exempting Stellantis would create a cost advantage over U.S.-assembled trucks that already contain imported components, which are subject to existing tariffs. GM warned that granting relief to Stellantis could set a precedent, prompting other automakers to seek similar exemptions for vehicles built outside the U.S., including Mexican-made Chevrolet and GMC models.

Ford’s stock edged 0.4% higher in midday trade, with retail sentiment dropping to ‘bearish’ from ‘bullish’ and chatter slowing down to ‘high’ from ‘extremely high’ over the past day. Meanwhile, GM’s stock gained 0.14% as sentiment simmered down to ‘neutral’ from ‘bullish’ amid ‘high’ levels of chatter.

The report stated that sources said it remains unclear when a decision on the tariffs will be finalized, or whether any reduction will be granted. The Trump administration has been known to provide tariff relief to companies like Apple (AAPL) and Pfizer (PFI) in exchange for commitments to increase domestic manufacturing.

The report comes as the October 1 deadline, given by President Donald Trump for imposing duties on heavy-duty trucks, has passed, and no official update has come from the White House.

Q2: 2.4%

Q3: 1.8%

Q4: 4.3%

Much of this edge stems from seasonal factors, including the Christmas holiday shopping surge that boosts retail and consumer sectors from November through December. Strong earnings reports in Q4 also often fuel optimism, as companies close out the year with solid results.

The quarter also aligns with the close of the old investing adage to ""sell in May and go away,"" where investors who sidelined themselves during the slower summer months return to the markets adding capital, driving demand.

Summary

I reiterate my buy rating on The Trade Desk despite recent volatility and growth deceleration, seeing the selloff as a buying opportunity.

TTD maintains a strong balance sheet with $1.7 billion in cash, no debt, solid GAAP profitability, and attractive profit margins.

While growth is slowing due to tariffs and economic uncertainty, I expect sustainable double-digit top-line growth and reasonable long-term valuation.

Risks include competition from Amazon and generative AI, but TTD remains well positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift to online advertising.

GOOGL,"Google to Build $4 Billion Arkansas Data Center, Add Jobs","This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Google (GOOGL, Financials) is planting new roots in Arkansas with a $4 billion data center in West Memphis, its first facility in the state. The project, announced this week, is one of the biggest private investments ever made in the region.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with RIVN.

Is GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

Spread across more than 1,000 acres, the data center will run on power from Entergy Arkansas. The site is expected to fuel Google's growing cloud and AI operations, while also giving a major boost to the local economy. Construction will bring thousands of jobs, and once the center opens, hundreds of people will be hired for operations.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called it a milestone for the state, saying the scale of the project shows confidence in Arkansas' workforce and future growth. For West Memphis, it's a chance to become a key part of the tech economy.

Google isn't stopping at the build.The corporation also said it would set up a $25 million Energy Impact Fund for the neighborhood around it. The money will be used to help people weatherize their homes, install innovative energy-saving devices, and train people for careers in the energy sector.

The move shows how tech companies are racing to build more data centers all around the U.S. to keep up with the demand for cloud services and AI. It's a new chapter for Arkansas, and it might change the state's role in the digital economy for a long time.",Yahoo!

GOOGL,"Oracle Customers Targeted In Extortion Scheme Following Major Hacking Campaign - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)","Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has alerted its E-Business Suite customers about a series of extortion emails after a major hacking campaign.

Clients Alerted To Upgrade Software After Cl0p Attacks

Oracle, in a blog post, acknowledged the receipt of extortion emails by its E-Business Suite customers. The company urged its clients to update their products, as the hackers may have exploited known software vulnerabilities. However, Oracle did not provide further details or disclose the number of affected clients.

Notably, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) had previously warned about this issue on Wednesday, as reported by Reuters. Google also described the hacking campaign as “high volume.”

Check the current price of ORCL stock here

The ransomware group cl0p, tied by Google to the extortion campaign, told the publication that Oracle had “bugged up,” while noting, “We (are) not prepared to discuss details at this time.”

The group, believed to be Russia-linked or Russian-speaking, operates as a ransomware-as-a-service group, renting out its software and infrastructure to other cybercriminals for a share of the proceeds.

Cynthia Kaiser, the head of cybersecurity firm Halcyon’s Ransomware Research Center, told Reuters that ransom demands have ranged from millions to tens of millions of dollars, with the highest demand reaching $50 million.

Google, TransUnion Previously Hit By Major Cyberattacks

The cyberattack on Oracle’s E-Business Suite customers is the latest in a series of high-profile hacking incidents affecting major corporations. In August, Google confirmed a data breach that affected some of its customers, attributed to a hacking group known as ShinyHunters.

This breach occurred in one of Google’s Salesforce database systems, which stores contact information and related notes for small and medium-sized businesses.

Additionally, in the same month, TransUnion confirmed a cyberattack that compromised the personal data of 4.4 million U.S. consumers. The attack was attributed to a third-party application serving TransUnion’s U.S. consumer support operations.

Oracle Names Co-CEOs, Exec Shifts, Insider Sale

In September, Oracle named Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-CEOs, while longtime CEO Safra Catz becomes executive vice chair of the board. Mark Hura was promoted to president of global field operations and Doug Kehring to principal financial officer. The company also reaffirmed its recent earnings guidance.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, Naomi O. Seligman, a Director at Oracle executed a notable insider sale, according to a recent SEC filing. A Form 4 filed with the SEC revealed that Seligman sold 2,222 Oracle shares, valued at a total of $641,958.

Benzinga's Edge Rankings place Oracle in the 92nd percentile for momentum and the 70th percentile for growth, reflecting its strong performance in both areas. Check the detailed report here.

The analyst noted App Store revenue rose 10% year-over-year in Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, reaching $8.7 billion, according to developer revenue data from SensorTower. Total downloads across iPhone and iPad grew 2.5% year-over-year to nine billion during the same period, he noted.

Mohan emphasized that dollars per download increased 7.3% year-over-year to 97 cents, showing stronger monetization. For September alone, revenue rose 7% year-over-year, outpacing the 3% growth in downloads, the analyst said.

He cited strong capital returns, Apple’s eventual leadership in AI at the edge and optionality from new products and markets.

Mohan also noted the revenue mix continues to shift away from gaming, which bodes well for Apple’s long-term Services revenue. In the fourth quarter, games accounted for 45% of App Store revenue by category, down from historic levels above 50%, the analyst told. Productivity apps gained roughly 300 basis points year over year, the most significant growth among categories, he said.

While gaming remains the dominant contributor, Mohan viewed steady growth in categories such as Productivity and Photo & Video as constructive, since this diversification should support sustainable revenue growth. The analyst flagged Apple’s upcoming Oct. 21 appeal hearing in the Epic Games case as another key event for the App Store business.

On the AI front, he underscored how search-oriented AI apps are increasingly capturing daily active user share from the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) Google search app (excluding Safari and Siri).

Google’s app share slipped to 73% in September, down from 85% in January, Mohan noted. ChatGPT emerged as the biggest beneficiary, with its share increasing from 14% in January to 24% in August, according to the analyst.

Mohan highlighted how ChatGPT has successfully monetized its user base, with App Store revenue rising from about $10 million in January 2024 to roughly $215 million in September 2025.

Mohan projected fiscal 2025 sales of $416.04 billion and EPS of $7.39.

AAPL Price Action: Apple shares were up 0.46% at $258.32 at publication on Friday.

GOOGL,"Amazon, Meta Beware: AI Is Pushing Tech Firms Into Debt Spiral - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)","U.S. tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) have plowed hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence over the past two years, initially using their hefty cash piles — but Goldman Sachs says that cushion is wearing thin, and debt is quickly becoming the next funding source.

Check out how META stock is doing here.

In a note shared Friday, Goldman analysts led by Lotfi Karoui said the liquidity positions of major tech companies are now ""approaching normalcy,"" and that there's a ""noticeable shift towards debt financing"" to support surging capital expenditures in AI.

That shift is showing up across credit markets: $141 billion in corporate debt has already been issued in 2025 by companies in Goldman's AI equity basket, surpassing the $127 billion raised in all of 2024.

Of this year's total, $86 billion came from tech issuers, while utilities — key players in powering AI infrastructure — contributed another $51 billion.

What's Driving The Shift From Cash To Debt?

Two main forces are behind this move, according to Goldman:

• First, the cash buffers that once made Big Tech so financially resilient have shrunk.

Goldman highlights that current balances are now almost on par with the median investment-grade non-financial company — meaning Big Tech isn't sitting on the same mountains of liquidity it once was.

• Second, the appetite for AI infrastructure spending remains voracious. Capex growth in the AI sector is expected to rise by about 50% year over year through 2025, fueled by the need to expand data centers, invest in specialized chips and develop proprietary models.

""On the margin, the read-through is negative for aggregate credit quality,"" the Goldman team said, though they stopped short of sounding any major alarms.

While companies like Microsoft and Alphabet still benefit from strong cash flows and modest leverage, the changing mix in how they fund growth deserves attention.

Data Centers, Vendor Deals and Asset-Backed Securities

This shift isn't limited to just bond issuance. The data center segment of the asset-backed securities (ABS) market has seen $20 billion in deals since the start of 2024, according to Goldman.

This includes structured deals backed by future revenue from facilities designed specifically to support AI workloads.

Private and bilateral financing deals are also expanding, with vendors playing a bigger role in funding AI infrastructure through tailored credit agreements.

What Does It Mean for Investors?

So far, the pivot to debt has been absorbed relatively smoothly by credit markets, thanks to the high quality and low default risk of these issuers.

However, as AI-related investments continue to balloon, debt will likely keep piling up — possibly putting pressure on credit spreads if cash flow expectations falter.

This financial evolution matters not just for bondholders, but also for equity investors betting on AI as the next growth wave.

With capex no longer fueled purely by excess cash, returns will face new scrutiny, and the margin for error is shrinking.

Goldman's analysis underscores how AI is no longer just an innovation story — it's now deeply tied to credit dynamics that could reshape how markets assess Big Tech's balance sheets.

MSFT,7 Best Long-Term ETFs to Buy and Hold - WTOP News,"The best stock market strategies are built to last, with success measured in years and decades rather than days and weeks. That may not always be easy on investors’ emotions, as day-to-day headlines can be difficult to ignore. But finding the right long-term ETFs to buy and hold can be surprisingly simple.

The following list of exchange-traded funds keeps this long-term approach in mind, featuring low-cost, diversified options. These are all large funds with billions in assets, low expense ratios and foundational investment strategies designed to deliver over time.

[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]

On the surface, there’s a strong appeal in finding a stock pick that doubles your money overnight. But statistics show that’s simply not a realistic way to build lasting wealth. Instead, these long-term ETFs offer a way to make your patience pay off in the years to come:

ETF Expense ratio Net assets Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (ticker: VOO) 0.03% $734 billion iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF) 0.18% $123 billion Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (SCHA) 0.04% $19 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) 0.05% $96 billion Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) 0.06% $53 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) 0.03% $136 billion iShares Gold Trust (IAU) 0.25% $60 billion

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)

Assets: $734 billion Expense ratio: 0.03% (or $3 annually on a $10,000 investment)

VOO remains a go-to option for long-term investors thanks to its low cost structure and the simple reality that it’s rarely wise to bet against the U.S. economy over the long term. This dominant ETF is elegant in its simplicity, tracking the S&P 500 index of leading blue-chip companies and providing exposure to household names — from megabank JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) to multitrillion-dollar tech giant Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to health care titan Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). If you want to invest in the U.S. stock market for the long haul, this is one of the easiest ways to do it.

iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF)

Assets: $123 billion Expense ratio: 0.18%

For investors interested in dominant U.S. companies but looking to skip over the sleepier corners of Wall Street, this iShares ETF screens the largest 1,000 U.S. stocks and selects the top 400 or so based on growth criteria such as revenue and earnings expansion. The result is a focused list that still includes S&P 500 favorites like Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL), while largely excluding utilities, energy, real estate and materials stocks — which collectively make up less than 2% of the fund. If you’re seeking long-term growth, IWF is a well-established and cost-effective choice.

Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (SCHA)

Assets: $19 billion Expense ratio: 0.04%

This Schwab ETF targets smaller, more growth-oriented stocks that average less than $6 billion in market value. It holds more than 1,700 names, making it highly diversified. The top sectors include financial services and industrials at around 19% apiece, followed by technology (14%) and health care (13%). You may not recognize many of the fund’s holdings, but that’s the point — it offers access to under-the-radar small caps with long-term potential. With a cost-effective structure and wide diversification, SCHA allows investors to tap into significant growth as these smaller firms mature.

Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)

Assets: $96 billion Expense ratio: 0.05%

On the flip side of growth investing, VIG focuses on large-cap stocks with a strong record of increasing dividends year after year. That makes it a solid long-term bet, with top holdings including chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), payments processor Visa Inc. (V) and pharmaceutical leader Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). With about 340 total holdings, this ETF is well diversified across some of the most stable companies on Wall Street — an ideal characteristic for investors seeking income and resilience.

Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT)

Assets: $53 billion Expense ratio: 0.06%

For those seeking geographic diversification, this ETF holds nearly 10,000 stocks spanning both the U.S. and international markets. While it’s weighted toward larger companies — with familiar U.S. blue chips still ranking among its top holdings — its global reach ensures exposure to a much broader list of stocks. Roughly 60% of the portfolio is in U.S. equities, with Japan and the U.K. also representing meaningful portions. For long-term investors who want to participate in the global equity markets, VT offers a convenient one-stop solution.

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

Assets: $136 billion Expense ratio: 0.03%

BND provides broad exposure to the bond market, offering an important counterbalance to equities. After interest rates surged in 2022 and 2023 to their highest levels since 2000, the Federal Reserve began loosening monetary policy with the first in a series of rate cuts in September 2024. Even so, BND continues to yield more than 4%, providing moderate income without the volatility of stocks. For long-term investors seeking a more stable, income-generating asset class, this ETF delivers both diversification and consistency.

iShares Gold Trust (IAU)

Assets: $60 billion Expense ratio: 0.25%

Gold has significantly outperformed both stocks and bonds in 2025, thanks to its low-risk appeal and perception as an inflation hedge. While this year may be an outlier, gold has long been considered a store of value — sought after in both good times and bad. IAU is one of the largest and most affordable ETFs offering direct exposure to physical gold, rather than to gold mining companies or related sectors. For investors looking to hedge risk and diversify across asset classes, IAU is a worthy long-term holding.

MSFT,Comparing Microsoft With Industry Competitors In Software Industry - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),"In today's fast-paced and competitive business landscape, it is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts to thoroughly analyze companies before making investment decisions. In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) against its key competitors in the Software industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.

Microsoft Background

Microsoft develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. It is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. The company is organized into three equally sized broad segments: productivity and business processes (legacy Microsoft Office, cloud-based Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, LinkedIn, Dynamics), intelligence cloud (infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings Azure, Windows Server OS, SQL Server), and more personal computing (Windows Client, Xbox, Bing search, display advertising, and Surface laptops, tablets, and desktops).

Upon closer analysis of Microsoft, the following trends become apparent:

A Price to Earnings ratio of 37.81 significantly below the industry average by 0.31x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth.

With a Price to Book ratio of 11.16, significantly falling below the industry average by 0.8x, it suggests undervaluation and the possibility of untapped growth prospects.

The Price to Sales ratio is 13.67, which is 0.76x the industry average. This suggests a possible undervaluation based on sales performance.

The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.19%, which is 1.13% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.

Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $44.43 Billion, which is 56.96x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.

With higher gross profit of $52.43 Billion, which indicates 34.72x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

The company's revenue growth of 18.1% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 64.8%. This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance.

Debt To Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity.

Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.

When evaluating Microsoft alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:

Microsoft has a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers, as evidenced by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.18.

This suggests that the company has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be perceived as a positive indicator by investors.

Key Takeaways

For Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. On the other hand, Microsoft's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency. However, the low revenue growth rate may be a concern for future performance compared to industry peers.

MSFT,Palantir Stock Falls On Report Army Communications Network Flawed,"Shares in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) fell Friday on a report that a prototype battlefield communications network being developed by the software maker and Anduril Industries has security problems. With Friday's retreat, Palantir stock has gained over 135% in 2025.

The prototype battlefield communications network is rife with ""fundamental security"" problems and vulnerabilities, and should be treated as a ""very high risk,"" according to a recent internal Army memo, said a Reuters report. On the stock market today, Palantir stock fell 4.4% to 178.87 in morning trading.

In July, the Army awarded Anduril a $99.6 million contract with partners that include Palantir to develop the next phase of the Army's Next-Generation Command and Control (NGC2) platform prototype. Other Anduril partners include Striveworks, Govini, Instant Connect Enterprise, Research Innovations and Microsoft (MSFT).

Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin in early September received a $26 million contract to develop a NGC2 prototype architecture. The Army is expected to approve more prototype projects.

One view is that NGC2 could serve as a foundational piece for a larger, integrated Space Dome data network. The ""Golden Dome"" air and missile defense shield is expected to cost $175 billion or more.

Further, Anduril is viewed as a new challenger to defense industry incumbents.

Also, Anduril has been developing pilotless fighter jets and other autonomous systems. It was founded by former Facebook executive Palmer Luckey and three former Palantir executives. Further, Elon Musk's SpaceX, Anduril and Palantir are collaborating on a satellite-based defense system proposal, according to reports.

MSFT,Market analysis: pharmaceuticals surge amidst mixed tech performance | investingLive,"Market Overview

Today's US stock market showcased a dynamic interplay between different sectors, highlighted by a notable surge in pharmaceuticals. Investors witnessed a mixed performance in the tech space, with broader implications for future market trends.

🔬 Healthcare Sector: Pharmaceuticals Lead the Charge

The healthcare sector demonstrated robust performance, spearheaded by pharmaceuticals. Eli Lilly (LLY) surged by 1.95% alongside Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), advancing by 1.80%. This sector's resilience can be attributed to strong quarterly earnings and positive drug trial results, which instill investor confidence.

📈 Technology: Mixed Signals

The technology sector painted a complex picture. Microsoft (MSFT) exhibited a moderate gain of 0.56%, while semiconductor titan Nvidia (NVDA) slipped slightly by 0.09%. This reflects cautious optimism amidst regulatory uncertainty and supply chain challenges.

Positive movers like Broadcom (AVGO) saw a rise of 0.81%, underlining selective investor interest.

🚗 Consumer Cyclical: Divergent Paths

Amazon (AMZN) contributed positively with a 0.50% increase, suggesting stability in internet retail. However, Tesla (TSLA) faced headwinds, declining by 2.03%, indicating volatile investor sentiment in the auto manufacturing domain.

📊 Market Mood and Trends

Overall, the market displayed a balanced sentiment with pockets of growth. The buoyancy in healthcare stocks suggests a shift towards defensive plays amidst global economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, mixed outcomes in tech reveal sector-specific caution, especially around semiconductors and regulation.

📌 Strategic Recommendations

Investors are advised to keep an eye on the healthcare sector, particularly pharmaceuticals, due to their positive trajectory. Diversification remains key in navigating the tech sector's varied landscape. A cautious approach is recommended for technology investments, especially within semiconductors, as market sensitivity to regulatory news remains high.","News & Analysis for Stocks, Crypto & Forex | investingLive",2025-10-03T14:46:54Z,https://investinglive.com/stock-market-update/market-analysis-pharmaceuticals-surge-amidst-mixed-tech-performance-20251003/,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-04 00:21:46.302324,,0.2784313725490195

Note the following:

The chart of SPY is a quarterly chart to give you a long term picture.

The chart shows in 2007 our Protection Band was at 100%. The chart shows that the stock market subsequently fell 50%.

The chart shows our back up the truck and buy signal was given on March 9, 2009. At the time of the signal, it was a bold call. With the benefit of hindsight, March 9, 2009 turned out to be the start of an epic bull market.

The chart shows that the stock market has risen 10X since our back up the truck and buy signal.

Prudent investors should pay attention to the comparison between 2007, 2009, and now.

Sentiment

In 2007, sentiment was extremely positive. Greed was dominant, and fear did not exist.

In 2009, sentiment was extremely negative. Fear was dominant, and greed did not exist.

In 2025, sentiment is extremely positive. Greed is dominant, and fear is minimal.

Wall Street

In 2007, Wall Street was very positive and raising targets.

In 2009, Wall Street was very negative and lowering targets.

In 2025, Wall Street is very positive and raising targets.

Momo Crowd

In 2007, the momo crowd was the dominant force in buying stocks.

In 2009, the momo crowd was the dominant force in selling stocks.

In 2025, the momo crowd is the dominant force in buying stocks.

Smart Money

In 2007, smart money was selling stocks.

In 2009, smart money was aggressively buying stocks.

In 2025, smart money is slowing trimming stocks.

Here is our analysis:

When conditions are similar to 2007, prudent investors should be 100% hedged on long positions, buying inverse ETFs, and short selling aggressively.

When conditions are similar to 2009, prudent investors should be aggressively buying strategic positions.

Under current market conditions, prudent investors should be holding good strategic positions, starting new strategic positions only on pullbacks, and focusing on special situations as well as tactical positions.

Due to the government shutdown, the jobs report is not available today.

So far, the government shutdown has been overshadowed by massive AI deals. As an example, please see yesterday's Morning Capsule regarding the massive memory deal.

In our analysis, if the government shutdown lasts longer, the stock market may start noticing. The plan continues to be to buy stocks on any dip.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows

Most portfolios are now heavily concentrated in the Mag 7 stocks. For this reason, to get ahead and get an edge, investors need to dig below the surface of the Mag 7 stocks. It is equally important to rise above the noise of daily news on the Mag 7 stocks. The best way to get an edge, dig below the surface, and rise above the noise of the daily news is to pay attention to early money flows in the Mag 7 stocks on a daily basis. When there is significant news in the Mag 7 stocks that rises above the threshold of noise and impacts your entire portfolio, it is covered in the main section above.

In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).

Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).

Bitcoin

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.",Benzinga,2025-10-03T15:30:21Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48020004/our-plan-for-the-shutdown,0.4,2025-10-04 00:21:25.591904,,0.192156862745098
MSFT,October Marks Start of Q4 Rally. These 2 Stocks Are Ready to Run Higher,"October kicks off the fourth quarter, a period that has consistently delivered the strongest gains for U.S. equities. Data from the S&P 500 shows its performance for each period:

Q1: 1.8%

Q2: 2.4%

Q3: 1.8%

Q4: 4.3%

Much of this edge stems from seasonal factors, including the Christmas holiday shopping surge that boosts retail and consumer sectors from November through December. Strong earnings reports in Q4 also often fuel optimism, as companies close out the year with solid results.

The quarter also aligns with the close of the old investing adage to ""sell in May and go away,"" where investors who sidelined themselves during the slower summer months return to the markets adding capital, driving demand.

The point is simple. Big Tech is pouring money into artificial intelligence infrastructure and others are now joining the party. Wedbush estimates almost $350 billion of capital spending by US technology giants this year, with governments in the Middle East and the UK starting to follow suit.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google remain at the centre, but the ripple effect is spreading across chips, software and data centres.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is singled out as the prime beneficiary, with demand for its graphics processors continuing to exceed expectations.

But Wedbush also highlights names such as Palantir, which it says could reach a $1 trillion market capitalisation in two to three years as enterprises look for ways to deploy AI at scale.

The worry for some is that valuations already look stretched. Wedbush counters that investors who focused narrowly on near-term earnings multiples would have missed out on every major technology growth story of the past two decades.

MSFT,TDV vs. TDIV: Talking Tech Dividends With ETFs | The Motley Fool,"Many investors don't readily think of dividends and tech together, but there's more than meets the eye with this union.

Talk to enough experienced dividend investors and chances are they'll rattle off sectors like consumer staples, healthcare and utilities as some of their favorite payout destinations. Odds are equally good that they won't mention technology.

That's understandable, because the 12-month distribution rate on the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index is a piddly 0.48%Obviously nothing to write home about, but that data point obfuscates tech's status as a rising payout growth spot. In fact, in dollar terms, Microsoft (MSFT 0.76%) and Apple (AAPL 0.63%) are two of the biggest dividend payers in the S&P 500.

Apple and Microsoft are widely held stocks, but in what amounts to a pleasant surprise for equity income investors, the duo is an appetizer in the tech dividend equation. Seven-course meals are available with the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV 0.78%) and the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF (TDV 0.81%).

Similar tickers, but different methodologies. So, let's examine how these ETFs live up to their tech dividend billings.

TDV: A familiar playbook

As its name implies, the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF has Dividend Aristocrats DNA. The TDV follows the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats – a collection of tech companies that have increased payouts for at least seven straight years.

With tech and dividends still considered newlyweds, that index requirement sounds confining, but TDV holds 38 stocks. That roster size is aided by index flexibility that allows for ""tech-related"" companies. Mastercard (MA 0.63%) and Visa (V 1.78%) being prime examples.

If there's a rub with TDV's plumbing, it's that the dividend increase streak requirement precludes some big names from entering the index. For example, Alphabet (GOOG -0.15%) and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) are dividend payers, but they haven't increased payouts for seven straight years, so they're not yet candidates for TDV admission.

TDV has points in its favor, including equally weighting its holdings. That means the ETF can be an income-generating complement to stakes in tech funds that weigh components by market capitalization – many of which have rosters where a small number of stocks command whopping percentages of the portfolios.

TDIV: Tech dividend flexibility

While TDV's dividend increase streak mandate has a country club membership feel to it, the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund has its own elements of exclusivity. The fund follows the Nasdaq Technology Dividend™ Index, which has several rules dividend investors need to acknowledge. Those include requiring member firms to have paid a dividend over the past year, no payout cuts over that time and a minimum yield of 0.50%.

By eschewing the payout increase streak protocol, TDIV sports a significantly larger roster than its rival – 94 holdings to be precise. There's another big difference between the tech dividend ETFs. TDIV holdings are dividend value-weighted. In plain English, the ETF's index places added emphasis on stocks with big dividends and massive market caps. Hence, Broadcom (AVGO 0.78%), Oracle (ORCL 0.09%) and Microsoft combine for nearly a quarter of the ETF's weight. TDIV has a different way of doing things, but it's hard to argue with its performance since inception in August 2012.

There are other marquee differences between TDIV and its nearest competitor. Notably, the First Trust ETF can hold international stocks, some of which have been additive to performance, and 20% of its portfolio can be allocated to communication services stocks. The latter point is pertinent because if Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META -1.11%) increase their payouts enough to drive their yields to 0.50%, those stocks would be eligible for TDIV admittance, perhaps increasing the ETF's growth profile along the way.

Different tech dividend strokes for different folks

For fee-conscious investors, TDV is an appealing option because its annual expense ratio is 0.45%, or $45 on a $10,000 position, compared to TDIV's 0.50%, but fee tussles aren't the end ETF comparisons. Smart investors know there's more to the story.

The ProShares ETF may be more appropriate for investors seeking documented dividend dependability via an instrument that as currently constructed, leans into mature, older guard technology companies. Plus, the fund's equal-weight methodology may be attractive at a time when so many cap-weighted indexes are heavily concentrated in a small number of stocks.

On the other hand, TDIV is perhaps the better choice for growth investors that want a dash of income. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns, but it shouldn't be ignored that over the past three years, TDIV's returns and volatility traits stacked up well against some traditional tech ETFs, indicating its flexibility and index mechanics play in investors' favor.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-03T14:31:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/tdv-vs-tdiv-talking-tech-dividends-with-etfs/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:21:44.636708,,0.3568627450980393
TSLA,Tesla Q3 Deliveries Reach Record Levels: Is TSLA Stock a Buy?,"Tesla TSLA delivered 497,099 electric vehicles (EVs) in the third quarter of 2025, up 7.4% year over year and surpassing our estimate of 435,370 units. Deliveries included 481,166 Model 3/Y and 15,933 other vehicles, marking the highest quarterly total in the company’s history. With the $7,500 EV tax credit expiration at the end of September, many customers likely rushed to purchase vehicles to take advantage of the incentive, fueling third-quarter demand.

It wasn’t just Tesla that benefited from this “pull forward” effect. Auto giants like Ford F and General Motors GM also logged record EV sales for three months ending September. Ford’s EV sales surged more than 30%, while GM more than doubled its tally.

With that being the general momentum across the broader industry, the key question is whether it is wise to buy Tesla stock now?

Tesla Europe and China Sales Dynamics

While Tesla doesn’t officially break down sales by region, the third-quarter jump likely came from the United States. In Europe, however, the company has been facing weakening demand amid intensifying competition from both legacy automakers and Chinese EV players, alongside a backlash tied to Elon Musk’s political activities. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported that Tesla sold 8,220 vehicles in the EU in August, down about 37% year over year, as cited by Yahoo Finance.

China presents a slightly better picture. According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), Tesla’s August deliveries declined 9.9% year over year but climbed more than 40% from July, per CnEVPost. Between January and August, Tesla only posted year-over-year growth in March and June but September is expected to be stronger. In August, Tesla also launched the Model Y L — a stretched, six-seat version of its popular SUV designed for Chinese families seeking larger vehicles. The new variant is anticipated to help reignite demand in the region.

TSLA’s Energy Business is Strong

Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage business continues to grow rapidly, driven by strong demand for Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment now delivers the company’s highest margins. Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage products in the third quarter of 2025, setting a new quarterly record.

Tesla’s Strides in AI, AV and Robotics Domain

The company is now pivoting big into artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving and robotics. Tesla’s robotaxi services, launched in June in Austin, have since expanded to California, Nevada and Arizona.The company’s fleet advantage—millions of vehicles already equipped with self-driving hardware—positions it for scale once regulations allow.

The latest Full Self-Driving (FSD) v14 was launched last week, with v14.2 coming soon. Tesla is also advancing its Optimus humanoid robot, expected to enter mass production next year. Already performing tasks in Tesla factories, Optimus underscores management’s view that autonomy and AI represent Tesla’s greatest competitive edge.

A Look Into Tesla’s Price Performance & Valuation

Last month, shares of Tesla rose roughly 37%, outperforming the industry and legacy U.S. automakers — Ford and General Motors.

1-Month Price Performance Comparison

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The surge was fueled by Musk’s declaration of stepping away from politics, the board’s proposed $1 trillion pay package, and Musk’s $1 billion stock purchase. Investors viewed these developments as signals of renewed commitment.

The proposed compensation plan ties payouts to ambitious milestones, boosting adjusted EBITDA 25-fold to $400B by 2035, achieving an $8.5T market cap (from ~$1.3T today), selling 20M vehicles annually, and deploying 1M each of robotaxis and humanoid robots. The board’s move underscores its reliance on Musk’s leadership to deliver on Tesla’s long-term AI and autonomy ambitions. (Can Musk's $1T Pay Package Keep Tesla on the Fast Track?)

Shortly after, Musk scooped up $1 billion worth of company shares. Basically, the board bet that Musk’s leadership is the only way Tesla can successfully pivot into AI, autonomous vehicles and robotics. And Musk’s $1 billion share purchase added to that narrative of commitment.

But should investors look past Tesla’s ongoing challenges and just bet on promises that may take years to materialize?

From a valuation perspective, Tesla appears stretched. Based on its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 13.81, way higher than the industry as well as its own 5-year average.

How to Play Tesla Now

Through the first three quarters of 2025, Tesla sold over 1.2 million vehicles, down on a year-over-year basis. The third quarter was strong, but it was largely in line with industry momentum. Investors should note that Musk warned of “rough quarters ahead” on the lastearnings call making third-quarter commentary crucial. Historically, Tesla boosts sales through incentives and price cuts in the fourth quarter, but such moves weigh on already pressured margins. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year contraction of 5.2% and 31.4%, respectively.

While recent events—Musk’s stock purchase, pay package, record third-quarter deliveries—have fueled optimism, questions over Tesla’s demand trajectory, especially overseas, still linger. Rising competition and long-term projects (AI, robotaxis, humanoids) may take years to materially impact results. So, it’s better to wait for more clarity before rushing to buy the stock.

TSLA,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Shifts Gear After Soaring in 3rd Quarter,"Key Takeaways

Tesla shares, the biggest gainer among Magnificent Seven stocks in the third quarter, fell Friday for the second straight day despite a better-than-expected deliveries report from the EV maker.

The stock rallied to a nine-month high in Thursday's trading session before closing below the prior day’s low to form a bearish engulfing pattern, a candlestick formation that warns of a potential move lower.

Investors should watch crucial support levels on Tesla's chart around $367 and $292, while also monitoring vital resistance levels near $489 and 660.60.

Tesla (TSLA) shares lost ground Friday morning after tumbling yesterday despite a better-than-expected deliveries report from the EV maker.

Investors appear to be locking in profits after the stock surged 40% in the third quarter, making it the best performing member of the Magnificent Seven over that period. Tesla shares were down 1.6% at $429 in recent trading, after dropping more than 5% on Thursday.

The stock has gotten a boost in recent months from CEO Elon Musk's renewed commitment to the company after a stint working for the Trump administration, as well as investor optimism about the company's development of autonomous driving systems and robotics as part of a more-intense focus on AI-related opportunities.

Investors will be watching for further business updates from Tesla when the company reports earnings on October 22.

Below, we take a closer look at Tesla’s chart and use technical analysis to point out crucial price levels worth watching out for.

Bearish Engulfing Pattern Emerges

Since breaking out from a broad ascending triangle last month that coincided with a bullish golden cross forming on the chart, Tesla shares had continued to trend higher.

However, in Thursday’s trading session, the stock closed below the prior day’s low to form a bearish engulfing pattern, a candlestick formation that warns of a potential move lower. Moreover, yesterday’s selling saw the relative strength index fall to its lowest level since early September, signaling weakening price momentum in the stock.

Let’s identify important support and resistance levels on Tesla's chart that investors will likely be watching.

This area would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline that also forms part of a longer-term horizontal line extending back to November last year.",Yahoo!

Crucial Support Levels to Watch

A move lower could see the shares initially test the $367 level. This area would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline that also forms part of a longer-term horizontal line extending back to November last year.

Tesla bulls’ failure to defend this level opens the door for a potential decline toward $292. Investors could seek entry points in this region near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart between March and July.

Resistance Levels to Monitor

The first resistance level to monitor sits around $489. Tactical traders who have bought shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near the December peak, which also marks the stock’s all-time high.

Finally, If Tesla shares move into price discovery, investors can forecast a potential resistance level by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle.

When applying the analysis to Tesla’s chart, we calculate the percentage change near the widest section of the ascending triangle and add it to the pattern top trendline value. For instance, we apply an 80% increase to $367, which projects an upside target of $660.60.

TSLA,BlackBerry Stock Pops on QNX Growth and Tesla Woes Add Long-Term Tailwind,"In line with my previous assessment, BlackBerry’s (BB) QNX unit performed very well last quarter, driven by increasing royalties generated by its namesake operating system.

And QNX’s strong performance enabled the company’s Q2 results and its guidance to surpass the Street’s expectations significantly, pushing the shares much higher.

Primarily due to QNX’s strong performance and its huge potential, I remain bullish on BlackBerry (BB) stock.

Also noteworthy is that BlackBerry’s Secure Communications business showed some notable “green shoots.”

But one point that seems to be missing from the recent, largely bullish reporting on BB is the key role that Tesla’s (TSLA) struggles could play in boosting BlackBerry’s fortunes over the longer term.

Let’s take a look at the latter issue first.

Why Tesla’s Woes Could Help BlackBerry

BlackBerry has noted that QNX has been utilized by 24 of the world’s 25 top electric-vehicle (EV) makers. And according to multiple reports, Tesla is the one EV maker on the list that does not use QNX.

Tesla has been losing meaningful market share in its three main markets – the U.S., Europe, and China –for many months, and the multi-billionaire’s decision to leave government does not seem to have helped matters much.

In the U.S. EV market, Tesla’s share of the EV sector reportedly reached a record low recently. The company reported better-than-expected deliveries for the third quarter recently, but the results are unlikely to change its market share much since other brands also probably got big boosts due to the expiration of the EV tax credits in September. Moreover, the quarter’s results are probably a one-time phenomenon as a result of the tax-credit expiration. In Europe in August, the automaker’s sales slid a huge 37% versus the same period a year earlier, and in China, registrations of Teslas fell 4% year-over-year in August, including exports, even though the Chinese EV market is reportedly “booming.”

Cumulatively, it’s clear that BlackBerry’s customers are gaining significant market share at Tesla’s expense. Assuming that trend continues, it should meaningfully boost BB’s top and bottom lines over the long term, since Tesla reportedly does not utilize QNX and all of the other top EV makers do.

QNX Is Already Performing Very Well

In BB’s fiscal second quarter that ended in August, the QNX unit’s revenue advanced a strong 15% versus the same period a year earlier to $63.1 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in at an impressive $20.5 million. Moreover, the firm raised its full-year guidance for QNX’s revenue from $256 million to $270 million, and now expects that the unit’s sales will come in at $66 million to $70 million for the current quarter.

And under its current CEO, John Giamatteo, BB frequently exceeds its guidance projections, making it likely that the unit’s revenue this quarter could easily wind up being over $70 million. Such a development, in turn would suggest that the unit does indeed have a great deal of momentum.

Also importantly, Giamatteo noted on the company’s Q2 earnings call that the pipeline of the latest version of QNX is still increasing and remains divided equally between auto and non-auto customers. This indicates that the operating system’s use by industries other than the auto sector may be continuing to expand quickly.

And suggesting that BB continues to have significant momentum among leading automakers, the CEO noted that the firm had obtained a deal worth about $15 million “in the Chinese market with a leading global tier-one supplier to power ADAS applications,” while BMW and Qualcomm (QCOM) had launched Snapdragon RidePilot.

According to Giamatteo, the latter product “enables an active safety system that is continually updated with cloud-based information from global fleets.”

Finally, boding well for QNX’s future as an OS in robots, the software will be used by “a leading North American camera and vision module supplier…globally in automated mobile robots and subsequently in humanoid robotics,” the CEO reported.

Secure Communications Shows Some Green Shoots

A “key (German) government agency” made a five-year deal with BlackBerry for its SecuSmart mobile-communications security system, while SecuSmart for the first time is being used extensively on iOS devices, Giamatteo stated.

Further, the U.S. State Department agreed to increase the extent to which it utilizes the firm’s emergency-notification system as part of a new deal for the offering, and the Coast Guard and Department of Veteran Affairs made new deals involving the system.

Finally, a Canadian government agency agreed to utilize SecuSmart, and the number of customers leaving BlackBerry’s UEM offering dropped.

The Bottom Line on BB Stock

QNX is growing rapidly, and amid Tesla’s issues and the unit’s other positive catalysts, its growth could very well surge tremendously over the long time. Meanwhile, there are reasons to be cautiously upbeat about the Secure Communications unit.

Consequently, I believe that BB’s price-book ratio of four is quite low, making the shares appear to be a good opportunity for long-term growth investors.

TSLA,Rivian reveals concerning shift in consumer behavior,"Electric vehicle sales were stronger than expected in the third quarter, leading to a record-breaking three months for OEMs like Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) and Tesla (TSLA) .
But in this case, a rising tide hasn't lifted all boats for EV makers.
EV makers with record-setting Q3
- Ford: 85,789 hybrid, PHEV and BEV sales, +20%
- General Motors: 66,501 EVs in Q3, YTD 144,668, +105%
- Tesla: 497,099 deliveries, +7.3%
EV maker Rivian (RIVN) apparently wasn't invited to the record delivery party, as the company announced on Thursday that it is narrowing its guidance.
Rivian stock falls on disappointing Q3 delivery data
Rivian shares fell 7.4% to $13.53 on Thursday after Rivian reported its third-quarter delivery figures.
Rivian produced 10,720 vehicles and delivered 13,201. Third-quarter deliveries increased 32% compared to the same period a year ago.
While these figures aligned with its internal forecast, Rivian announced that it now expects to deliver between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles for the year, narrowing from its previous guidance between 40,000 and 46,000.
Rivian is scheduled to announce third-quarter financial results after the market closes on November 4. Analysts expect a loss of 71 cents per share on revenue of $1.49 billion.
Rivian currently offers just two models: the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently raised their price target to $15 from $12 per share with a neutral rating.
In August, Canaccord dropped its price target to $23 from $21 per share while maintaining a ""buy"" rating.
Rivian EV rival Tesla has a record-breaking quarter
Rivian rival Tesla had a blowout quarter, but investors treated its stock just as harshly as it treated Rivian Thursday.
Tesla blew away expectations in the third quarter, delivering 497,099 electric vehicles, a significant increase from the 462,890 cars it delivered in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Bloomberg on average were expecting the company to deliver fewer than 440,000.
Car buyers were incentivized to purchase EVs this quarter as the $7,500 EV tax credit, which has been in place for 15 years, expired at the end of September.

Tesla shares fell more than 5% Thursday.
""Nearly 500,000 deliveries is impressive, but the stock's drop despite the beat tells you what really matters: investor confidence in what comes next, not what just passed. What likely rattled the market: the feeling that Q3 strength was pulled forward (ahead of the EV tax-credit deadline), leaving Q4 vulnerable to a steep drop,"" RTMNexus CEO Dominick Miserandino said.

Third Quarter Gets Tax Credit Help

Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries of around 497,000, up 7% year-over-year and ahead of Goldman Sachs’ estimates of 455,000.

Rivian third-quarter deliveries of 13,200 were up 32% year-over-year and beat a consensus estimate of 12,700. The total missed a Goldman Sachs estimate of 13,950.

""We note that US EV industry sales likely benefitted from pull-in demand related to the end of the up to $7,500 EV federal tax credit under the IRA,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in a new investor note.

Delaney said customers who placed a purchase order and deposit before Sept. 30 could still get the credit, which means there could still be some benefit to EV sales in the fourth quarter and short term.

""However, we expect the loss of the credit to be a headwind for the market in the coming quarters.""

Delaney estimates the loss of the credits could lead to a ""double-digit percent headwind"" for the sector.

The analyst said with the ending of the federal tax credits, new vehicle launches could become even more important and be the major tailwind for investors, citing the Model Y L and lower cost models from Tesla and the upcoming R2 launch for Rivian.

Tesla Price Target Increased

Delaney maintained a Neutral rating on Tesla and raised the price target from $395 to $425 after the third-quarter delivery figures.

""We believe upside relative to our estimate was likely driven mostly by the US market, including vehicles that came out of inventory, aided by buying ahead of the end of the IRA EV purchase credit on 9/30,"" Delaney said.

The analyst estimates Tesla's US sales were up more than 10% year-over-year in the quarter. Delaney estimates that sales in Europe and China were down year-over-year, but up on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

While the tax credit expiration is a headwind for the fourth quarter, Delaney highlighted several potential positives for Tesla going forward.

The analyst said Tesla's third-quarter earnings and a Nov. 6 shareholder meeting could be future positive catalysts.

Delaney said key topics for the Tesla story include the outlook for vehicle deliveries, automotive margins, progress for robotaxis, progress for FSD, Tesla Energy growth and growth in other segments.

Rivian Guidance Adjusted

Delaney maintained a Neutral rating on Rivian with a $15 price target after third-quarter deliveries were reported.

""Rivian slightly lowered its full year delivery guidance by 500 vehicles at the midpoint,"" Delaney said.

The analyst said the new guidance implies 42,500 vehicle deliveries at the midpoint, which is in line with Goldman Sachs' estimate of 42,500 and slightly above consensus estimates of 42,400.

Delaney said the key items to watch for Rivian are increased volumes, margins, vertical integration, cash burn, and the supply chain.

Stock Price Action

Tesla stock is down 2.2% to $426.45 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $212.11 to $488.54. Tesla stock is up 12.4% year-to-date in 2025.

Rivian stock is down 0.7% to $13.44 on Friday versus a 52-week trading range of $9.50 to $17.14. Rivian stock is up 1.4% year-to-date in 2025.

TSLA,Elon Musk Pay Package Compared To NFL: 'Imagine You're Patrick Mahomes And Not Gonna Get A Salary' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),"A new pay package proposed by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could significantly increase the wealth of CEO Elon Musk, but also comes with milestones and incentives that would reward the company and shareholders along the way.

Freedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods compares the new pay package to the world of sports.

Musk Pay Package

Woods told Benzinga recently that Musk's pay package based on milestones would be similar to an NFL player getting paid only based on milestones and incentives.

""Imagine you are Patrick Mahomes and you're not gonna get a salary,"" Woods told Benzinga.

Woods said Musk's pay package would be similar to Mahomes not getting a salary, but instead only getting paid if his team makes the NFL Playoffs, wins playoff games and wins Super Bowls.

""This is the Elon Musk package, but it's in financial terms.""

While some athletes have incentives tied to individual statistics and reaching the postseason, the majority of contracts include a high salary with incentives that provide a bonus. Musk's pay package is entirely incentive- and milestone-based.

Woods couldn't help but recall that Musk has a history of hitting past pay package milestones set before him.

""He's hit the financial metrics of making this company hit all these milestones.""

The market expert said that Musk moving away from work with the White House to focus on Tesla could help the company hit future milestones.

Woods highlighted the robotics and AI stories for Tesla, and those are the key metrics that Musk will likely focus on and could hit in the coming years. The market strategist said it could be the electric vehicle milestones that Musk struggles to hit in his pay package.

During the interview, which was conducted when Tesla stock was trading closer to $424, Woods couldn't help but point out that shares of the EV company had ""technically broken out.""

Woods said Tesla stock has a history of running to new all-time highs when shares have a technical breakout.

""This is a beautiful breakout.""

Pay Package Pushback

Musk's new pay package could be worth up to $900 billion in Tesla stock if all milestones and incentives are hit over the next 10 years.

The milestones include Tesla's market capitalization, adjusted EBITDA, vehicle deliveries, FSD subscribers, robotaxis in commercial service and humanoid robot deliveries. Musk must also stay with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to be able to cash out his shares. A CEO succession plan from Musk must also be approved by Tesla's board of directors.

Many of the milestones are aggressive, including Tesla needing to hit a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion to reach the highest market cap milestone incentive.

Musk's pay package has received criticism from multiple people, including New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. In a statement, DiNapoli described the pay package, which could make Musk the first trillionaire, as ""excessive.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has also spoken out about Musk's pay package, saying it is ""grossly immoral.""

The pay package has also generated attention from Pope Leo XIV, who voiced concern that Musk becoming a trillionaire could widen the global income gap.

Tesla's Board of Directors has voiced support for the pay package and highlighted the strong returns Tesla stock has had under Musk's leadership.

Summary

The US economy shows mixed signals with inflation near 3%, decent GDP growth, but a softening labor market amid high 10-year yields and Fed politicization.

Yet, US equities are at an all-time high. I think this is an effect of USD debasement; the S&P 500 is flat in gold terms since 2016 and declining in Bitcoin terms.

Global expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, compounded by demographics, AI disruptions, and geopolitics, erode governments' credibility worldwide, including America's.

I think Bitcoin on-chain metrics signal growing maturity: short-term cost basis rising to $110,000-$118,000, balanced long-term holder activity, and declining exchange balances.

My updated valuation model targets $1 million in a bullish reserve asset case versus $100,000 in a bearish one; my expected value for a BTC bet, at $162,500-$275,000, exceeds the current ~$120,000 price.

The state of the US economy has been a hot topic of discussion for most analysts lately. US inflation seems to be sticking closer to 3% than the theoretical 2% target. In that context, the Fed might not have

I either put my money into low cost funds or in single stocks that (I think) are asymmetric bets. My portfolio is roughly 50/50 between the two. I like to write about Macro and Fundamentals, with the (painful) awareness that Momentum and Sentiment are what really matters. That’s the reason I never try to time the market and I only buy stocks if I am willing to hold them for at least 10 years.When it comes to fundamentals, I think everybody knows the market is forward looking, but few truly understand what that means. I don’t look at a P/E number and decide to buy if a stock is “cheap”. I see markets as literally just the meeting point between demand and supply. Predicting human behavior is the key.That’s why I always try to understand what the market is seeing in a stock beyond the numbers, which often implies trying to understand sectors, industries and long term growth trends. My approach requires ingenuity, curiosity and a good dose of naivete, as well as being comfortable in (sometimes) going against the current.I am currently bullish AMD, PLTR, TSLA, broad US equities and Bitcoin.

TSLA,Our Plan For The Shutdown - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Epic Bull Market

Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).

Note the following:

The chart of SPY is a quarterly chart to give you a long term picture.

The chart shows in 2007 our Protection Band was at 100%. The chart shows that the stock market subsequently fell 50%.

The chart shows our back up the truck and buy signal was given on March 9, 2009. At the time of the signal, it was a bold call. With the benefit of hindsight, March 9, 2009 turned out to be the start of an epic bull market.

The chart shows that the stock market has risen 10X since our back up the truck and buy signal.

Prudent investors should pay attention to the comparison between 2007, 2009, and now.

Sentiment

In 2007, sentiment was extremely positive. Greed was dominant, and fear did not exist.

In 2009, sentiment was extremely negative. Fear was dominant, and greed did not exist.

In 2025, sentiment is extremely positive. Greed is dominant, and fear is minimal.

Wall Street

In 2007, Wall Street was very positive and raising targets.

In 2009, Wall Street was very negative and lowering targets.

In 2025, Wall Street is very positive and raising targets.

Momo Crowd

In 2007, the momo crowd was the dominant force in buying stocks.

In 2009, the momo crowd was the dominant force in selling stocks.

In 2025, the momo crowd is the dominant force in buying stocks.

Smart Money

In 2007, smart money was selling stocks.

In 2009, smart money was aggressively buying stocks.

In 2025, smart money is slowing trimming stocks.

Here is our analysis:

When conditions are similar to 2007, prudent investors should be 100% hedged on long positions, buying inverse ETFs, and short selling aggressively.

When conditions are similar to 2009, prudent investors should be aggressively buying strategic positions.

Under current market conditions, prudent investors should be holding good strategic positions, starting new strategic positions only on pullbacks, and focusing on special situations as well as tactical positions.

Due to the government shutdown, the jobs report is not available today.

So far, the government shutdown has been overshadowed by massive AI deals. As an example, please see yesterday's Morning Capsule regarding the massive memory deal.

In our analysis, if the government shutdown lasts longer, the stock market may start noticing. The plan continues to be to buy stocks on any dip.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows

Most portfolios are now heavily concentrated in the Mag 7 stocks. For this reason, to get ahead and get an edge, investors need to dig below the surface of the Mag 7 stocks. It is equally important to rise above the noise of daily news on the Mag 7 stocks. The best way to get an edge, dig below the surface, and rise above the noise of the daily news is to pay attention to early money flows in the Mag 7 stocks on a daily basis. When there is significant news in the Mag 7 stocks that rises above the threshold of noise and impacts your entire portfolio, it is covered in the main section above.

In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).

Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).

Bitcoin

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.",Benzinga,2025-10-03T15:30:21Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48020004/our-plan-for-the-shutdown,0.4,2025-10-04 00:21:53.682690,,0.192156862745098

Reasons for Staying Bullish on GRAB Stock

Impressive GMV Growth: Grab is benefiting from robust growth in On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), an expanding fintech portfolio, and rising user engagement across its platform. On-Demand GMV, which covers the mobility and deliveries segments, rose 21% year over year in the second quarter of 2025. For full-year 2025, the company projects revenues between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, suggesting 19-22% year-over-year growth.

Grab’s success in Southeast Asia is largely driven by its ability to adapt to local market conditions. The company’s transformation from a simple taxi-hailing app into an “everyday everything app” — offering services, such as food delivery, e-scooter rentals, and digital payments — underscores its ambition to expand and diversify.

Impressive Earnings Estimate Revisions: Despite the tough conditions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GRAB has moved northward over the past 60 days, demonstrating the confidence of analysts in the stock’s prospects.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Partnership With AWS: Grab is strengthening its position across Southeast Asia by partnering with Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — to drive growth in mobility, deliveries and financial services.

Grab selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate growth across its mobility, deliveries and financial services verticals, including its digital banks. Grab has enhanced operational efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs and launched innovative services by utilizing AWS’ scalable, secure and cost-efficient cloud solutions.

Further diversifying its portfolio in January 2025, GRAB partnered with BYD to expand access to up to 50,000 EVs to Southeast Asia, offering Grab’s driver-partners access to BYD’s EVs at competitive rates, alongside financing options and extended battery warranties.

AV Ambitions Bode Well: GRAB has decided to make a strategic equity investment in China’s WeRide WRD to accelerate the deployment and commercialization of Level 4 robotaxis and shuttles across Southeast Asia. The association aims to integrate WeRide’s autonomous vehicles into Grab’s platform to enhance service quality and safety.

The investment, expected to be closed in the first half of 2026, aligns with WeRide’s strategy to scale its commercial AV fleet in the region and advance AI-driven mobility solutions. Grab, in association with WeRide, recently unveiled Ai.R Autonomous Service for Punggol. This is GRAB’s first AV service for consumers in Singapore. Grab has been selected by local authorities to operate two autonomous shuttle service routes in the Punggol area. Ai.R is the only service selected to run on two routes in Punggol and will start with a fleet of 11 vehicles.

The Ai.R fleet will have two WeRide vehicle models: the five-seater GXR and eight-seater Robobus. Grab expects Ai.R to start transporting passengers by early 2026. This follows a test phase for the vehicles to study the routes in detail. Earlier in the year, WeRide was granted a permit by the Shanghai municipal government to operate autonomous robotaxi ride-hailing services.

GRAB Trades at a Premium

A Value Score of D suggests an expensive valuation for Grab at the moment. GRAB stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.31X compared with the industry’s 5.62X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

GRAB Still a Smart Buy for Investors

GRAB's strong portfolio and expanding partner base serve as key strengths, positioning the company as a formidable player in Southeast Asia’s super-app ecosystem. The favorable earnings estimate revision adds to its appeal.

The positive developments mentioned in the write-up have likely led to GRAB’s premium valuations, as investors are optimistic about the company’s prospects and profitability. Consequently, they are willing to pay a premium for the stock, anticipating that it will outperform its peers and the broader market in the coming months.

With many positives driving the stock, GRAB presents a compelling investment opportunity now. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an ideal candidate for addition to one’s portfolio.

AMZN,Futures Hit Another All Time High As Government Shutdown Enters Day 3 - Conservative Angle,"US equity futures are heading into Day 3 of the US government shutdown on pace for what is now another daily all time high. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1% as of 8:15 am in New York, on course for the longest winning streak since July. Pre-market, Mag 7 are all higher led by TSLA (+1.6%), NVDA (+0.6%) and AMZN (+0.6%). European stocks enjoyed similar as the tech-fueled rally continues. Nikkei rose almost 2% after Japan’s Hitachi teamed up with OpenAI and Fujitsu, expanding its collaboration with Nvidia. Today’s job report will become the latest casualty of the Democrats’ government shutdown, and that’s actually helping to keep volatility subdued, according to ING strategists. Bond yields are mostly unchanged; USD is lower. Energy and precious metals are both higher. Gold was on track for a seventh weekly gain, fueled by central bank buying amid falling US interest rates and lingering inflation concerns. There’s also a view that the underlying labor market likely isn’t as weak as the ADP print estimated this week. There have not been much incremental updates overnight as investors are still waiting for updates from the White House. The only major data release we will receive will be ISM Services which is expected to print at 51.7 vs. 52.0 prior.

In premarket trading Mag 7 stocks are all higher (Tesla +1.2%, Meta +0.5%, Nvidia +0.4%, Amazon +0.4%, Alphabet +0.2%, Microsoft +0.1%, Apple +0.1%).

Applied Materials (AMAT) is down 2.6% after the semiconductor-equipment maker said net revenue for FY 2026 is set to decrease by $600 million due to a new rule by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) rises 1.3% after UBS upgraded the metals company to buy from neutral.

Maplebear (CART), doing business as Instacart, falls 1% after Piper Sandler analyst Tom Champion cut his recommendation on the delivery-services provider to neutral from overweight, citing intensifying competitive pressures.

Tronox Holdings (TROX) is down 2.7% as JPMorgan downgrades to neutral from overweight, saying conditions in the titanium-dioxide industry have become more difficult near term.

Baidu Inc. US shares (BIDU) are up 1.2% after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the China-based search engine to $140 from $100.

USA Rare Earth (USAR) shares rise 9.6% after CNBC reported that the company is in close communication with the Trump administration, when asked whether it would be open to a deal with the US government.

In corporate news, Boeing’s 777X is said to fly commercially for the first time in early 2027 instead of next year, a fresh setback to the US planemaker. A large blaze has broken out after an explosion at a Chevron refinery in Los Angeles County, according to CBS News. Tesla was sued over claims that defects in the doors of a crashed Cybertruck made it a “death trap.”

Investors are wagering that the billions pouring into the AI sector will translate into profits and extend gains in tech shares. So far none of that has happened. Meanwhile, the rally underscores how bullish momentum is overshadowing concerns about a US government shutdown, now in its third day and prompting a blackout in key economic data. In fact, it’s been 114 trading sessions since the S&P 500 had a 5% pullback, as US stocks take investors on a one-way ride up. Not surprisingly, Bloomberg Intelligence found that bears are becoming a vanishing breed, as bullish call option volumes posts new records and shorting has become increasingly dangerous in the meme-stock era. Global equity ETFs saw $152 billion of inflows in the past three weeks, the most on record, according to BofA strategists citing EPFR Global data.

“Financial market volatility is falling across the board, partly driven by the US government shutdown and the delay to key data releases such as the September jobs data,” wrote ING strategists Chris Turner and Francesco Pesole. “Instead, investors remain transfixed by the AI-driven rally in megacap tech shares, which shows no signs of slowing.”

One way to play the AI mania is to barbell valuation extremes using cheap cyclical assets against rich tech, according to BofA’s Michael Hartnett. Fueling the excitement this week: Global Infrastructure Partners is in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers, while OpenAI continues to announce new partnerships. VC’s have poured $192.7 billion into AI startups so far this year, setting new global records according to PitchBook data.

The continued optimism around AI is stoking questions over how far the rally can run. Concerns are growing that valuations look overheated as spending has yet to translate into earnings.

“The market may well start asking questions whether current valuation levels are justified,” said Wolf von Rotberg, equity strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin. “Further upside is set to be much more gradual, with risks of a setback fairly elevated.”

Even as investors remain transfixed by AI and the hype that surrounds it, they’re keeping one eye on the relentless rally in gold. Central banks around the world are accumulating the metal, while a gauge of gold mining stocks has significantly outperformed chip makers this year.

European stocks are on track for their strongest week since May, gaining for a sixth day in a row, driven by investor optimism over artificial intelligence developments. In individual stocks, Barry Callebaut shares jump after Bloomberg News revealed the Swiss company’s main shareholder previously explored taking the chocolate maker private. Stoxx 600 rises 0.4% to 569.9 with 461 members up, 128 down, and 11 unchanged. Here are the biggest movers Friday:

Shares of European chip equipment makers edge lower on Friday after Applied Materials warned that a US export restriction published earlier this week will reduce its revenues

Earlier in the session, Asian stocks rose to head for a fifth consecutive session of gains, driven by technology shares on continued optimism over artificial intelligence. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.7%, taking its weekly advance to 2.7%. Japan was among the region’s top gainers ahead of the ruling party’s leadership election this weekend, while stocks slumped in Hong Kong. Markets were shut for holidays in mainland China and South Korea.

Heightened risk appetite fueled regional market gains Friday, with TSMC and Hitachi among the top contributors to the benchmark’s advance. Hitachi jumped 10% on a new strategic partnership with OpenAI while Fujitsu Ltd. expanded its collaboration with Nvidia. The day’s rally highlighted how global investors are largely brushing aside concerns about a potential bubble in tech shares. Meanwhile, Global Infrastructure Partners was in advanced talks to acquire Aligned Data Centers, a major beneficiary of the AI spending boom, in a deal that could value the company at about $40 billion. Hong Kong’s stock benchmarks slipped, taking a breather after recent gains. Most tech and EV shares were down, while Alibaba extended its rally.

In FX, dollar weakens against most of the G-10. The yen lags after BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda avoided any clear hints on the rate path.

In rates, treasury yields are within a basis point of Thursday’s closing levels as US session gets under way, with government shutdown in its third day to postpone the release of September employment report. Yields kept to narrow ranges overnight, leaving 10-year near 4.08%; Gilts outperforming in Europe, with yields edging lower: UK 10-year is ~2bp richer vs US after weaker-than-expected UK services PMI. IG dollar issuance slate empty so far and expected to remain light; weekly total stands at $13.7 billion vs dealers’ projection of $25 billion. Services gauges from S&P Global and ISM are unaffected, however, and several Fed officials are slated to speak.

In commodities, oil prices bounced, though still set for a hefty weekly loss, Brent trading just below $65/barrel. Oil headed for its biggest weekly decline since late June, ahead of an OPEC+ meeting that’s expected to result in the return of more idled barrels. Gold slightly higher, up about $5 for the session and off records hit earlier in the week. Gold was on track for a seventh weekly gain, fueled by central bank buying amid falling US interest rates and lingering inflation concerns. And despite all the hype around AI and the surge in chip stocks this year, gold miners have actually been the better bet. An MSCI Inc. gauge of global gold equities has soared about 135% in 2025. It’s on course for its biggest-ever outperformance against the index compiler’s measure of major semiconductor firms, which is up 40%.

Looking at today’s US economic calendar we get the September final S&P Global US services PMI (9:45am) and September ISM services (10am); September jobs report would normally land at 8:30am but it is being delayed. Fed speaker slate includes Goolsbee (8:30am), Miran (9:35am, 3:30pm), Logan (1:30pm) and Jefferson (1:40pm)

APAC stocks were mostly firmer, taking their cue from Wall Street’s gains amid light newsflow, whilst the looming delay of the US jobs report due to the government shutdown keeps focus on Fed speak and upcoming ISM data. Mainland Chinese and South Korean markets remained closed for holidays. ASX 200 was supported by strength in technology and healthcare names, though gold miners lagged as the yellow metal pulled back. Nikkei 225 outperformed, driven by weakness in the yen and strength in technology, while remarks from BoJ Governor Ueda following this week’s Tankan Survey underlined the need to maintain an accommodative monetary environment, with focus also on the upcoming LDP elections. Hang Seng declined, bucking the regional trend as it failed to benefit from gains in technology, with Stock Connect closed and Mainland participants absent during Golden Week.

Top Asian News

BoJ Governor Ueda said the Bank will continue raising interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with its forecast, while stressing the need to maintain an accommodative monetary environment to support the economy. He said the likelihood of the baseline forecast materialising will be scrutinised alongside upside and downside risks, with close monitoring of the global outlook, including the US economy, the impact of tariffs on corporate profits, wage and price-setting behaviour, and overall price developments. Ueda noted signs that consumers are cutting back on spending amid rising food prices, which the BoJ is watching carefully. He said corporate profits are likely to stay elevated, though some manufacturers are being hit by tariffs, as seen in exports and output data. He reiterated the BoJ wants to support business activities by keeping policy loose, but warned that tariff policy creates global uncertainty and a 15% tariff rate would weigh on the economy. He added that economic growth is likely to moderate before rising again as overseas economies return to a moderate growth path, and emphasised that judgements will be made without preconceptions on whether the economy and prices are moving in line with the forecast. He repeated that interest rates will continue to be raised if conditions follow the outlook, while noting that the impact of US tariffs has not spread to Japan’s entire economy so far, according to Reuters.

Japan Finance Minister Kato said tariffs cannot be boosted on countries importing Russian oil from the perspective of compliance with international laws. He added that Japan is watching with high interest the impact of the US government shutdown on markets and the economy.

European bourses (STOXX 600 +0.4%) opened slightly firmer and have traded sideways throughout the morning. No real moves to EZ Final PMI revisions. European sectors have opened slightly firmer with Banks (+1.0%), Basic Resources (+0.8%) and Retail (+0.6%) leading the way. The former benefits from upside in Raiffeisen Bank (+6.2%) after the FT reported that the EU is to lift sanctions on Deripaska to compensate the bank. Towards the bottom of the pile; Technology has been the worst performing sector, with losses broadbased; ASML (-0.8%) and BE Semiconductor (-2.4%) both on the backfoot. This pressure can be attributed to commentary via Applied Materials (-3.8% pre-market) which stated that the US BIS Affiliates Rule will cut Q4 revenue by about USD 110mln and reduce FY26 revenue by about USD 600mln.

FX

USD is flat today and currently trades within a very narrow 97.75 to 97.94 range; most recently, some modest pressure has been seen in the Dollar, but without a clear driver. Nothing really too pertinent for the Dollar by way of newsflow; some focus has been on President Trump, where he stated that he is considering taxpayer rebates of USD 1,000–2,000 funded by tariff revenue, according to Reuters. Elsewhere, the WSJ reported that Trump is looking to send billions in cash bailouts to farmers with taxpayer money. With the jobs report now shelved, focus will now be on US PMIs and ISM Services. The former is generally overshadowed by the ISM report; on that, the consensus expects the headline to fall slightly to 51.8 from 52.0 in September; the business activity gauge is seen falling to 51.8 from 55.0. Additionally, a handful of Fed officials are scheduled today.

EUR is on a slightly firmer footing today, but without a clear driver. The bulk of the marginal upside was seen around the European cash open and continued to trend higher on the releases of European PMIs. To recap those PMIs, Spain Services and Italian Services both beat expectations whilst the French, German, and then the EZ-wide metrics were revised a touch lower. The EZ release highlighted that the data will likely “confirm the stance” for those ECB members who opt for no more cuts. Sticking with the ECB, some very marginal upside was seen in the single-currency after ECB President Lagarde said former ECB member Knot would make a “good” President at the Bank, via ANP; for reference, Knot was a hawkish member during his tenure. Now focus will turn to ECB’s Schnabel later in the day, who is also speaking at a Knot farewell symposium.

JPY is the worst-performing G10 currency, albeit very marginally so. Focus overnight has been on BoJ Governor Ueda, who stressed the importance of maintaining an accommodative monetary environment to support the economy – these comments sparked some modest pressure in the Yen. As it stands, markets currently assign a 64% chance of a hold at the October meeting. Ueda aside, focus will be on the weekend’s LDP election. In brief, polls currently suggest Takaichi as the favourite, followed closely by Koizumi; ING suggests that the former would be seen as more bearish for the JPY.

GBP is incrementally higher today and trades in a 1.3430 to 1.3467 range, and towards the midpoint of the prior day’s range. Today’s focus has been on the region’s Final PMI metrics, where the Services component was subject to a decent downward revision to 50.8 (prev. 51.9); as such, the Composite moved lower to 50.1. The accompanying release highlighted that corporate clients are deferring spending decisions until after the Autumn budget.

Antipodeans are both slightly firmer vs the Dollar, and with some very modest outperformance in the Kiwi. Nothing really driving the upside today, but perhaps buoyed by the continued upside in base metals prices.

Commodities

Crude benchmarks rebound after WTI and Brent extended below key levels of USD 61/bbl and USD 64.20/bbl respectively in Thursday’s session. Initially, oscillating between USD 60.90-61.27/bbl and USD 64.50-64.85/bbl after picking up modestly during the APAC session. In geopolitics, a senior Hamas official said that they will need more time and are demanding substantial changes to the Trump plan. Crude benchmarks extended modestly on this to session highs of USD 61.38/bbl and USD 65.02/bbl respectively. As a reminder, Trump gave Hamas just three days to consider and accept the US-backed plan for Gaza. This upside was ultimately short-lived and has entirely pared.

Spot gold has thus far been relatively muted, after selling off from a strengthening dollar yesterday. XAU is currently oscillating within a c. USD 30/oz bound as economic newsflow remains light due to the US government shutdown.

US Event Calendar

DB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap

This week continues to see Europe and Asia outperforming the US, as fears about a prolonged government shutdown and some hawkish-leaning data meant sentiment in the US lagged again yesterday. However, a late rally led by Tech meant that the S&P 500 (+0.06%) just reached another record high, while the US 10yr Treasury (-1.5bps) fell back to 4.08%. But in Europe there was a more positive story again, with the STOXX 600 (+0.53%) up to a new record.

In terms of the US shutdown, yesterday brought no sign of an end to the impasse, with investors becoming increasingly concerned that it could drag on into next week. For instance, the Polymarket odds of the shutdown lasting beyond October 15 is currently at 45%, having stood at 34% as we went to press yesterday. So that added to concern about the shutdown having a larger economic impact, particularly given markets are lacking a lot of key data right now. Indeed, we’d normally be previewing the US payrolls number this morning, but the shutdown has seen that postponed, along with the usual weekly jobless claims yesterday.

In terms of progress on negotiations, Treasury Secretary Bessent called for a “clean continuing resolution” on federal spending in a CNBC interview, and warned that the shutdown could lead to a hit to US GDP and growth prospects. Those comments came as Trump posted on Truth Social that he would be meeting with his budget chief to determine which Democratic agencies he would decide to cut federal spending on, and whether these cuts would be temporary or permanent, potentially threatening “thousands” of jobs.

US Treasuries had spent the early part of the US day higher in yield, particularly at the front-end. One cause of that was an unusual release markets don’t normally pay much attention to, which was a payrolls estimate from Revelio Labs. That suggested nonfarm payrolls were up around +60k in September, which contrasted with the contractionary print (-32k) in the ADP’s report of private payrolls on Wednesday. That was also backed up by the Challenger job cut numbers, which found that job cuts in September were down -25.8% year-on-year. So that boosted optimism on the near-term US outlook, and meant investors pared back their expectations for rate cuts, now pricing in 91bps by the June meeting, down -1.0bps on the day. The 2yr yield spiked around 3bps on the data but ultimately settled barely higher (+0.4bps) at 3.539%, whilst the 10yr yield (-1.5bps) closed at 4.08%. Yields are back up just over a basis point overnight in Asia.

Back to the Fed, and we also heard a bit from Bessent on the Fed chair interviews, which he said were currently underway, and that he expected “3-to-5” candidates would be put forward for Trump’s consideration. Current Fed speakers continued to display a fairly balanced view. While the market wrestles with how to handicap the health of the US labour market without BLS data, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Goolsbee said officials can turn to other sources. He noted that his staff had produced labor market data that “indicates some steadiness in the labor market and I think the underlying economy is still growing pretty solidly”. Earlier in the day Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Logan said that she “has a little bit slower of a normalization of the policy path in order to make sure we get all the way to 2%.” She added that she felt labour market risks are “fairly balanced” and that “It doesn’t appear to be that policy is more than modestly restrictive.”

The S&P 500 (+0.06%) was able to shrug off shutdown jitters to creep to yet another record high. Things had looked even more promising at the open, before faltering following the employment data. Indeed, the S&P was pulled higher as the NASDAQ (+0.39%) managed to reach a new record, even as the Mag-7 underperformed that (+0.08%). Chipmaker stocks outperformed, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up +1.94% after yesterday’s overnight news that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have partnered with OpenAI as part of its Stargate AI push into data cloud centres.

In Europe, the mood was positive, and the STOXX 600 was up +0.53% to another record. We also saw multiple indices like the CAC 40 (+1.13%) and DAX (1.28%) jump over one per cent, although the UK’s FTSE 100 (-0.20%) lagged behind. That advance for the DAX comes as the multi-year German stimulus package is starting to come into effect, which is something I looked at in my chart of the day yesterday (link here). Meanwhile for bonds, yields on 10yr bunds (-1.3bps), OATs (-1.1bps) and BTPs (-0.6bps) all moved lower. 10yr Gilts (+1.4bps) underperformed as fiscal concerns persist and there was some intraday weakness after data from the Bank of England’s DMP survey which showed business inflation expectations were unchanged at 3.4%, albeit in-line with expectations.

In Asia, Japanese markets are leading the way, with the Nikkei soaring by +1.69%, nearing recent peaks, after a surprisingly dovish speech by BoJ Governor Ueda and ahead of a crucial ruling party vote that would determine the next Prime Minister of the country.

Ueda reaffirmed the bank’s longstanding position on interest rates, thus avoiding signalling any policy changes for this month following recent market speculation about an imminent rate hike. Market pricing has dipped to 59% for an October hike down from 65%. The Yen has weakened around a third of a percent. Staying with Japan, the jobless rate increased to 2.6%, its highest level in over a year in August, from 2.3% the previous month, and against expectations of 2.4%. Additional data revealed that the job-to-applicant ratio decreased to 1.20 from 1.22, marking the lowest number of job openings since 2022.

In other markets, the S&P/ASX 200 is up by +0.37%, whereas the Hang Seng is down by -0.94%, impacted by losses in EV stocks following a decline in Tesla overnight. Trading volumes are subdued due to market holidays in China and South Korea, with Chinese markets remaining closed until the middle of next week. US equity futures are up a couple of tenths of a percent.

To the day ahead now, we’ll get UK September official reserves changes, France August industrial production, Italy September services PMI, August retail sales, Q2 deficit, and Eurozone August PPI. For central banks, we’ll hear from the Fed’s Williams and Jefferson, ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB’s Sleijpen, Villeroy and Schnabel, and BOE Governor Bailey.",Brigitte Gabriel,2025-10-03T14:38:12Z,https://conservativeangle.com/futures-hit-another-all-time-high-as-government-shutdown-enters-day-3/,1.0,2025-10-04 00:22:34.688120,,0.2156862745098038
AMZN,From Apps to Nutrition: Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy Now,"An updated edition of the August 12, 2025 article.

The health and fitness industry has evolved from a niche pursuit to a global growth engine, fueled by a stronger cultural focus on healthier living. Consumers today want more than occasional workouts; they seek balanced nutrition, structured fitness routines, and comprehensive wellness solutions. Demand for gyms, supplements, and tailored programs continues to expand, while technology has made personal health management more accessible. Wearables, mobile apps, and online coaching provide real-time data, customized guidance, and ongoing motivation. Rising awareness of obesity, chronic illness, and mental well-being has only accelerated this movement toward proactive self-care.

Technology giants are playing a critical role in this evolution. Apple (AAPL), through the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ platform, blends health tracking with guided training experiences. Amazon (AMZN) is pushing deeper into healthcare with One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools with virtual care to make health management more convenient. These innovations are transforming how people approach wellness, merging fitness, healthcare, and daily life in ways that amplify industry growth.

The scale of opportunity is underscored by numbers. The global health and wellness market is expected to reach $11 trillion by 2034, advancing at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025. Preventive care initiatives, workplace wellness programs, and supportive government policies continue to reinforce this trend. At the same time, specialized offerings such as boutique studios and premium clubs highlight a more integrated view of physical, nutritional and mental health. This is opening new revenue channels for innovators like United Natural Foods (UNFI), American Well Corporation (AMWL), SunOpta (STKL) and Peloton Interactive (PTON).

For investors, the message is straightforward: wellness is here to stay. As consumers continue to prioritize their health, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health solutions should remain robust. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to highlight leading stocks in this space — including the four above — helping identify opportunities in a market set for sustained expansion.

The Zacks Rank #2 company has emphasized oat-based beverages, tapping into the rapid expansion of the dairy alternatives market.

The company has broadened its content library, rolled out fresh class formats, and added personalization features to keep members connected. Strategic moves such as lowering the cost of entry-level equipment, launching rental options, and expanding digital tiers have widened Peloton’s appeal across different demographics.

Innovation remains central as Peloton adapts to a changing fitness landscape. Partnerships with outside platforms and retailers have extended its reach, while international expansion has opened doors to new customers. The company has diversified into strength-focused hardware and expanded wellness offerings beyond cardio, complementing its core business. Efforts to streamline operations and improve supply chain management are aimed at boosting profitability. By combining premium equipment, versatile content, flexible subscriptions, and a loyal community, Peloton has transformed from a niche connected-bike maker into a broader fitness and wellness brand, well-positioned for the long-term growth of at-home and hybrid fitness markets.

AMZN,Competitor Analysis: Evaluating Amazon.com And Competitors In Broadline Retail Industry - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),"Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in comparison to its major competitors within the Broadline Retail industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry.

Amazon.com Background

Amazon is the leading online retailer and marketplace for third party sellers. Retail related revenue represents approximately 75% of total, followed by Amazon Web Services' cloud computing, storage, database, and other offerings (15%), advertising services (5% to 10%), and other the remainder. International segments constitute 25% to 30% of Amazon's non-AWS sales, led by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

By thoroughly analyzing Amazon.com, we can discern the following trends:

The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 33.9 is lower than the industry average by 0.79x, suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants.

It could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 7.11 which exceeds the industry average by 1.1x.

The Price to Sales ratio of 3.58, which is 1.58x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.

The Return on Equity (ROE) of 5.68% is 0.18% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits.

The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $36.6 Billion is 5.91x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.

With higher gross profit of $86.89 Billion, which indicates 5.23x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

With a revenue growth of 13.33%, which surpasses the industry average of 10.76%, the company is demonstrating robust sales expansion and gaining market share.

Debt To Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio helps evaluate the capital structure and financial leverage of a company.

Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.

When comparing Amazon.com with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed:

Compared to its top 4 peers, Amazon.com has a stronger financial position indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.4.

This suggests that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive attribute by investors.

Key Takeaways

For Amazon.com, the PE ratio is low compared to its peers in the Broadline Retail industry, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest that the market values Amazon.com's assets and sales highly. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth, Amazon.com outperforms its industry peers, reflecting strong financial performance and growth potential.

AMZN,Market analysis: pharmaceuticals surge amidst mixed tech performance | investingLive,"Market Overview

Today's US stock market showcased a dynamic interplay between different sectors, highlighted by a notable surge in pharmaceuticals. Investors witnessed a mixed performance in the tech space, with broader implications for future market trends.

🔬 Healthcare Sector: Pharmaceuticals Lead the Charge

The healthcare sector demonstrated robust performance, spearheaded by pharmaceuticals. Eli Lilly (LLY) surged by 1.95% alongside Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), advancing by 1.80%. This sector's resilience can be attributed to strong quarterly earnings and positive drug trial results, which instill investor confidence.

📈 Technology: Mixed Signals

The technology sector painted a complex picture. Microsoft (MSFT) exhibited a moderate gain of 0.56%, while semiconductor titan Nvidia (NVDA) slipped slightly by 0.09%. This reflects cautious optimism amidst regulatory uncertainty and supply chain challenges.

Positive movers like Broadcom (AVGO) saw a rise of 0.81%, underlining selective investor interest.

🚗 Consumer Cyclical: Divergent Paths

Amazon (AMZN) contributed positively with a 0.50% increase, suggesting stability in internet retail. However, Tesla (TSLA) faced headwinds, declining by 2.03%, indicating volatile investor sentiment in the auto manufacturing domain.

📊 Market Mood and Trends

Overall, the market displayed a balanced sentiment with pockets of growth. The buoyancy in healthcare stocks suggests a shift towards defensive plays amidst global economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, mixed outcomes in tech reveal sector-specific caution, especially around semiconductors and regulation.

📌 Strategic Recommendations

Investors are advised to keep an eye on the healthcare sector, particularly pharmaceuticals, due to their positive trajectory. Diversification remains key in navigating the tech sector's varied landscape. A cautious approach is recommended for technology investments, especially within semiconductors, as market sensitivity to regulatory news remains high.","News & Analysis for Stocks, Crypto & Forex | investingLive",2025-10-03T14:46:54Z,https://investinglive.com/stock-market-update/market-analysis-pharmaceuticals-surge-amidst-mixed-tech-performance-20251003/,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-04 00:22:25.736088,,0.2784313725490195
AMZN,Prediction: Amazon will stage a major comeback in the next 3 years. Here's 1 reason why.,"This article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.

Key Points

Amazon's stock is essentially flat for the year through Sept. 30, underperforming major indexes.

Investors have been disappointed with Amazon Web Services' growth compared to other competitors.

Amazon is making investments that could make it a go-to platform for enterprises dealing with AI.

It has been a disappointing year for Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock so far. It's trading essentially flat through Sept. 30. In contrast, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up 13% and 16.7%, respectively. Despite its underperformance in 2025, Amazon remains poised to be a strong investment going forward.

There are no guarantees in the stock market, but the same thing that has disappointed investors will likely be the same thing that stages Amazon's comeback: Its cloud services platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Investors have been disappointed with AWS' growth compared to other platforms like Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. In my opinion, the issue is more the lofty expectations placed on AWS amid artificial intelligence (AI) hype and optimism versus AWS' performance. In its most recent reported quarter, AWS' revenue increased 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, which isn't too shabby.

Amazon is rightly playing the long game with AWS, making heavy investments in AWS and AI infrastructure. It's building new data centers, designing its own AI chips (reducing its reliance on Nvidia), and expanding its overall networking capacity. These investments have temporarily shrunk AWS' margins, but they should pay off in the long term.

The global AI market is expected to explode in the next few years, with much of that being enterprises spending on cloud infrastructure and specialized AI tools. Enterprises looking to build and integrate AI products into their businesses need high computing power, secure data storage, and ready-to-go tools that make launching faster -- and Amazon is making sure AWS is the one-stop shop that can provide these.

At its size, a slowdown in growth in AWS was all but inevitable at some point. However, even if it loses some market share, the overall pie is expected to grow large enough that it will still have a tangible effect on Amazon's business.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-03T15:30:00Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/04/prediction-amazon-will-stage-a-major-comeback-in-the-next-3-years-heres-1-reason-why-usfeed/,0.5,2025-10-04 00:22:25.157996,,0.0117647058823529

Summary

I reiterate my buy rating on The Trade Desk despite recent volatility and growth deceleration, seeing the selloff as a buying opportunity.

TTD maintains a strong balance sheet with $1.7 billion in cash, no debt, solid GAAP profitability, and attractive profit margins.

While growth is slowing due to tariffs and economic uncertainty, I expect sustainable double-digit top-line growth and reasonable long-term valuation.

Risks include competition from Amazon and generative AI, but TTD remains well positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift to online advertising.

AMZN,Our Plan For The Shutdown - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Epic Bull Market

Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).

Note the following:

The chart of SPY is a quarterly chart to give you a long term picture.

The chart shows in 2007 our Protection Band was at 100%. The chart shows that the stock market subsequently fell 50%.

The chart shows our back up the truck and buy signal was given on March 9, 2009. At the time of the signal, it was a bold call. With the benefit of hindsight, March 9, 2009 turned out to be the start of an epic bull market.

The chart shows that the stock market has risen 10X since our back up the truck and buy signal.

Prudent investors should pay attention to the comparison between 2007, 2009, and now.

Sentiment

In 2007, sentiment was extremely positive. Greed was dominant, and fear did not exist.

In 2009, sentiment was extremely negative. Fear was dominant, and greed did not exist.

In 2025, sentiment is extremely positive. Greed is dominant, and fear is minimal.

Wall Street

In 2007, Wall Street was very positive and raising targets.

In 2009, Wall Street was very negative and lowering targets.

In 2025, Wall Street is very positive and raising targets.

Momo Crowd

In 2007, the momo crowd was the dominant force in buying stocks.

In 2009, the momo crowd was the dominant force in selling stocks.

In 2025, the momo crowd is the dominant force in buying stocks.

Smart Money

In 2007, smart money was selling stocks.

In 2009, smart money was aggressively buying stocks.

In 2025, smart money is slowing trimming stocks.

Here is our analysis:

When conditions are similar to 2007, prudent investors should be 100% hedged on long positions, buying inverse ETFs, and short selling aggressively.

When conditions are similar to 2009, prudent investors should be aggressively buying strategic positions.

Under current market conditions, prudent investors should be holding good strategic positions, starting new strategic positions only on pullbacks, and focusing on special situations as well as tactical positions.

Due to the government shutdown, the jobs report is not available today.

So far, the government shutdown has been overshadowed by massive AI deals. As an example, please see yesterday's Morning Capsule regarding the massive memory deal.

In our analysis, if the government shutdown lasts longer, the stock market may start noticing. The plan continues to be to buy stocks on any dip.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows

Most portfolios are now heavily concentrated in the Mag 7 stocks. For this reason, to get ahead and get an edge, investors need to dig below the surface of the Mag 7 stocks. It is equally important to rise above the noise of daily news on the Mag 7 stocks. The best way to get an edge, dig below the surface, and rise above the noise of the daily news is to pay attention to early money flows in the Mag 7 stocks on a daily basis. When there is significant news in the Mag 7 stocks that rises above the threshold of noise and impacts your entire portfolio, it is covered in the main section above.

In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).

Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).

Bitcoin

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.",Benzinga,2025-10-03T15:30:21Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48020004/our-plan-for-the-shutdown,0.4,2025-10-04 00:22:23.437473,,0.192156862745098
AMZN,"Amazon, Meta Beware: AI Is Pushing Tech Firms Into Debt Spiral - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)","U.S. tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) have plowed hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence over the past two years, initially using their hefty cash piles — but Goldman Sachs says that cushion is wearing thin, and debt is quickly becoming the next funding source.

Check out how META stock is doing here.

In a note shared Friday, Goldman analysts led by Lotfi Karoui said the liquidity positions of major tech companies are now ""approaching normalcy,"" and that there's a ""noticeable shift towards debt financing"" to support surging capital expenditures in AI.

That shift is showing up across credit markets: $141 billion in corporate debt has already been issued in 2025 by companies in Goldman's AI equity basket, surpassing the $127 billion raised in all of 2024.

Of this year's total, $86 billion came from tech issuers, while utilities — key players in powering AI infrastructure — contributed another $51 billion.

What's Driving The Shift From Cash To Debt?

Two main forces are behind this move, according to Goldman:

• First, the cash buffers that once made Big Tech so financially resilient have shrunk.

Goldman highlights that current balances are now almost on par with the median investment-grade non-financial company — meaning Big Tech isn't sitting on the same mountains of liquidity it once was.

• Second, the appetite for AI infrastructure spending remains voracious. Capex growth in the AI sector is expected to rise by about 50% year over year through 2025, fueled by the need to expand data centers, invest in specialized chips and develop proprietary models.

""On the margin, the read-through is negative for aggregate credit quality,"" the Goldman team said, though they stopped short of sounding any major alarms.

While companies like Microsoft and Alphabet still benefit from strong cash flows and modest leverage, the changing mix in how they fund growth deserves attention.

Data Centers, Vendor Deals and Asset-Backed Securities

This shift isn't limited to just bond issuance. The data center segment of the asset-backed securities (ABS) market has seen $20 billion in deals since the start of 2024, according to Goldman.

This includes structured deals backed by future revenue from facilities designed specifically to support AI workloads.

Private and bilateral financing deals are also expanding, with vendors playing a bigger role in funding AI infrastructure through tailored credit agreements.

What Does It Mean for Investors?

So far, the pivot to debt has been absorbed relatively smoothly by credit markets, thanks to the high quality and low default risk of these issuers.

However, as AI-related investments continue to balloon, debt will likely keep piling up — possibly putting pressure on credit spreads if cash flow expectations falter.

This financial evolution matters not just for bondholders, but also for equity investors betting on AI as the next growth wave.

With capex no longer fueled purely by excess cash, returns will face new scrutiny, and the margin for error is shrinking.

Goldman's analysis underscores how AI is no longer just an innovation story — it's now deeply tied to credit dynamics that could reshape how markets assess Big Tech's balance sheets.

It is hard to escape talk of an AI bubble. Yet Wedbush insists we are still in the foothills of what it calls an “AI capex super cycle”.

The broker argues that rather than a replay of the dotcom bust, today looks more like 1996, with the real growth spurt still ahead.

The point is simple. Big Tech is pouring money into artificial intelligence infrastructure and others are now joining the party. Wedbush estimates almost $350 billion of capital spending by US technology giants this year, with governments in the Middle East and the UK starting to follow suit.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google remain at the centre, but the ripple effect is spreading across chips, software and data centres.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is singled out as the prime beneficiary, with demand for its graphics processors continuing to exceed expectations.

But Wedbush also highlights names such as Palantir, which it says could reach a $1 trillion market capitalisation in two to three years as enterprises look for ways to deploy AI at scale.

The worry for some is that valuations already look stretched. Wedbush counters that investors who focused narrowly on near-term earnings multiples would have missed out on every major technology growth story of the past two decades.

With chief information officers racing to avoid being left behind, the analysts see trillions of dollars of additional investment still to come and believe the technology bull market has at least another two to three years to run.",Proactiveinvestors NA,2025-10-03T15:17:28Z,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1079685/bubble-or-are-we-are-we-at-the-start-of-an-ai-capex-super-cycle-1079685.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:22:25.158414,,0.223529411764706
NVDA,Market Analysis: NVIDIA And Competitors In Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment Industry - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA),"In the ever-changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, conducting thorough company analysis is crucial for investors and industry experts. In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its primary competitors in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, our aim is to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.

NVIDIA Background

Nvidia is a leading developer of graphics processing units. Traditionally, GPUs were used to enhance the experience on computing platforms, most notably in gaming applications on PCs. GPU use cases have since emerged as important semiconductors used in artificial intelligence to run large language models. Nvidia not only offers AI GPUs, but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. Nvidia is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.

Upon a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA, the following trends can be discerned:

A Price to Earnings ratio of 53.81 significantly below the industry average by 0.73x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth.

With a Price to Book ratio of 45.93, which is 5.06x the industry average, NVIDIA might be considered overvalued in terms of its book value, as it is trading at a higher multiple compared to its industry peers.

The Price to Sales ratio of 28.19, which is 2.18x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.

The Return on Equity (ROE) of 28.72% is 24.58% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits.

With lower Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $31.94 Billion, which is 0.8x below the industry average, the company may face lower profitability or financial challenges.

With higher gross profit of $33.85 Billion, which indicates 1.03x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.

The company's revenue growth of 55.6% exceeds the industry average of 26.43%, indicating strong sales performance and market outperformance.

Debt To Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity.

Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.

When evaluating NVIDIA alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:

Compared to its top 4 peers, NVIDIA has a stronger financial position indicated by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.11.

This suggests that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be seen as a positive attribute by investors.

Key Takeaways

For NVIDIA in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, the PE ratio is low compared to peers, indicating potential undervaluation. The high PB and PS ratios suggest strong market sentiment and revenue multiples. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and revenue growth, NVIDIA demonstrates high performance relative to industry standards, reflecting efficient operations and growth potential.

NVDA,"Nvidia, Broadcom, Marvell Poised To Gain Big From $1.2 Trillion AI Spending Wave By 2030: Analyst - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)","U.S. chipmakers including NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Credo Technology Holding Ltd. (NASDAQ:CRDO) are set to benefit from a massive wave of artificial intelligence infrastructure spending projected to top $1.2 trillion by 2030.

NVDA is in positive territory. See what is happening here.

Fueled by hyperscalers, sovereign AI projects and enterprise adoption, the unprecedented surge in capital expenditures could potentially triple between 2025 and 2030, cementing semiconductors and equipment makers like Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) and KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC).

BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya projects U.S. semiconductor companies will benefit heavily from an unprecedented surge in artificial intelligence infrastructure spending.

Also Read: Nvidia And Fujitsu Team Up To Build AI Systems For The Future

The analyst expects annual AI-related capital expenditures to nearly triple from 2025 to 2030, reaching more than $1.2 trillion, constrained only by the ability to scale data center buildings and power supplies.

He identifies four core drivers of this spending:

Upgrading traditional infrastructure to accelerated computing.

Defending the moats of major tech platforms in search, social media, e-commerce and cloud services.

Sovereign governments building national AI infrastructure.

Steady enterprise adoption of AI productivity tools.

Arya stresses that chipmakers such as Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Marvell and Credo, alongside semiconductor equipment vendors like Lam Research and KLA, stand best positioned to capture the gains.

The analyst argues that, unlike past investment cycles, this wave of spending is more durable because it is funded by robust cash flows from hyperscalers and sovereign buyers.

The top five U.S. cloud providers, he notes, are set to allocate about 25% of their 2025 sales to capital spending, supported by operating cash flow margins above 30%. At the same time, end users do not need to upgrade devices, meaning AI services like ChatGPT can scale instantly without costly consumer hardware refresh cycles, Arya noted.

Updating his cloud spending tracker, the analyst now sees capital expenditures of $443 billion in 2025 and $528 billion in 2026, reflecting year-over-year growth of 58% and 19%.

The analyst projects spending could climb to more than $1.2 trillion by 2030 if current capex intensity levels hold and U.S. hyperscalers contribute 60% to 70% of the total. While periods of digestion may occur, Arya considers the growth assumptions reasonable given the demand trajectory.

The analyst also addresses investor concerns around vendor financing. Nvidia's $100 billion commitment to OpenAI, Arya explains, should be viewed less as ""free GPUs"" and more as an offensive investment to expand its ecosystem.

To access that capital, OpenAI must secure up to 10 gigawatts of power and invest an additional $300 billion to $500 billion in equipment, while also ceding $100 billion in equity, he said.

Arya sees this deal as a catalyst, pushing other hyperscalers to accelerate their competitive AI deployments.

The analyst draws parallels with the 4G cycle, when global telecom operators invested $1.3 trillion between 2010 and 2020 while end users spent $3.6 trillion on smartphones. In contrast, the current AI cycle requires no new consumer devices, which makes adoption faster and cheaper.

Nvidia remains Arya’s top AI pick, backed by its moat in accelerators, networking hardware and ecosystem, supported by upcoming catalysts like the Vera Rubin platform and its role as OpenAI's preferred partner.

NVDA Price Action: Nvidia stock was trading higher by 0.15% to $189.17 at publication on Friday.

NVDA,"Stock market today: Dow leads S&P 500, Nasdaq toward records on AI fervor as shutdown delays jobs report","Stock market today: Dow leads S&P 500, Nasdaq toward records on AI fervor as shutdown delays jobs report
US stocks moved higher on Friday, eyeing more record highs, with Wall Street fixated on the promise of artificial intelligence, even as the government shutdown drags on and delayed the release of the monthly jobs report.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped roughly 0.7%, or over 300 points, leading the indexes higher. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.3%.
All three indexes are aiming to end the week with their latest records, as Wall Street has largely shrugged off the initial stages of the US government shutdown. Its impact was felt in investor circles Friday, as it delayed the release of the data, leaving Wall Street and the Federal Reserve in the dark. In its absence, Wall Street has turned to a bevy of private data that has confirmed the labor market's sharp slowdown this week.
But even amid the unanswered questions on the health of the US economy, stocks keep rising to new records, largely on the back of continued AI fervor. OpenAI's valuation climbed to $500 billion, making the company the most valuable startup in the world.
On Friday, new AI deals boosted optimism. Hitachi LTD (6501.T) teamed up with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) on energy projects, while Fujitsu (6501.T) expanded work with Nvidia (NVDA). Other sectors also continued standout performances — most notably pharma stocks, which by one measure were headed toward their best week in over a decade.
Meanwhile, there was no immediate end in sight to the shutdown. Democrats continue to push for the continuation of healthcare subsidies as a condition of funding the government, while Republicans refuse to negotiate on the issue until the government is back up and running. At the same time, President Trump has continued to ramp up his threats to fire federal workers and defund projects in Democratic-leaning states.

NVDA,Our Plan For The Shutdown - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Epic Bull Market

Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).

Note the following:

The chart of SPY is a quarterly chart to give you a long term picture.

The chart shows in 2007 our Protection Band was at 100%. The chart shows that the stock market subsequently fell 50%.

The chart shows our back up the truck and buy signal was given on March 9, 2009. At the time of the signal, it was a bold call. With the benefit of hindsight, March 9, 2009 turned out to be the start of an epic bull market.

The chart shows that the stock market has risen 10X since our back up the truck and buy signal.

Prudent investors should pay attention to the comparison between 2007, 2009, and now.

Sentiment

In 2007, sentiment was extremely positive. Greed was dominant, and fear did not exist.

In 2009, sentiment was extremely negative. Fear was dominant, and greed did not exist.

In 2025, sentiment is extremely positive. Greed is dominant, and fear is minimal.

Wall Street

In 2007, Wall Street was very positive and raising targets.

In 2009, Wall Street was very negative and lowering targets.

In 2025, Wall Street is very positive and raising targets.

Momo Crowd

In 2007, the momo crowd was the dominant force in buying stocks.

In 2009, the momo crowd was the dominant force in selling stocks.

In 2025, the momo crowd is the dominant force in buying stocks.

Smart Money

In 2007, smart money was selling stocks.

In 2009, smart money was aggressively buying stocks.

In 2025, smart money is slowing trimming stocks.

Here is our analysis:

When conditions are similar to 2007, prudent investors should be 100% hedged on long positions, buying inverse ETFs, and short selling aggressively.

When conditions are similar to 2009, prudent investors should be aggressively buying strategic positions.

Under current market conditions, prudent investors should be holding good strategic positions, starting new strategic positions only on pullbacks, and focusing on special situations as well as tactical positions.

Due to the government shutdown, the jobs report is not available today.

So far, the government shutdown has been overshadowed by massive AI deals. As an example, please see yesterday's Morning Capsule regarding the massive memory deal.

In our analysis, if the government shutdown lasts longer, the stock market may start noticing. The plan continues to be to buy stocks on any dip.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows

Most portfolios are now heavily concentrated in the Mag 7 stocks. For this reason, to get ahead and get an edge, investors need to dig below the surface of the Mag 7 stocks. It is equally important to rise above the noise of daily news on the Mag 7 stocks. The best way to get an edge, dig below the surface, and rise above the noise of the daily news is to pay attention to early money flows in the Mag 7 stocks on a daily basis. When there is significant news in the Mag 7 stocks that rises above the threshold of noise and impacts your entire portfolio, it is covered in the main section above.

In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In the early trade, money flows are negative in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).

In the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ).

Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks

Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV). The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).

Bitcoin

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying.

What To Do Now

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.",Benzinga,2025-10-03T15:30:21Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48020004/our-plan-for-the-shutdown,0.4,2025-10-04 00:22:39.934268,,0.192156862745098
NVDA,October Marks Start of Q4 Rally. These 2 Stocks Are Ready to Run Higher,"October kicks off the fourth quarter, a period that has consistently delivered the strongest gains for U.S. equities. Data from the S&P 500 shows its performance for each period:

Q1: 1.8%

Q2: 2.4%

Q3: 1.8%

Q4: 4.3%

Much of this edge stems from seasonal factors, including the Christmas holiday shopping surge that boosts retail and consumer sectors from November through December. Strong earnings reports in Q4 also often fuel optimism, as companies close out the year with solid results.

The quarter also aligns with the close of the old investing adage to ""sell in May and go away,"" where investors who sidelined themselves during the slower summer months return to the markets adding capital, driving demand.

It is hard to escape talk of an AI bubble. Yet Wedbush insists we are still in the foothills of what it calls an “AI capex super cycle”.

The broker argues that rather than a replay of the dotcom bust, today looks more like 1996, with the real growth spurt still ahead.

The point is simple. Big Tech is pouring money into artificial intelligence infrastructure and others are now joining the party. Wedbush estimates almost $350 billion of capital spending by US technology giants this year, with governments in the Middle East and the UK starting to follow suit.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google remain at the centre, but the ripple effect is spreading across chips, software and data centres.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is singled out as the prime beneficiary, with demand for its graphics processors continuing to exceed expectations.

But Wedbush also highlights names such as Palantir, which it says could reach a $1 trillion market capitalisation in two to three years as enterprises look for ways to deploy AI at scale.

The worry for some is that valuations already look stretched. Wedbush counters that investors who focused narrowly on near-term earnings multiples would have missed out on every major technology growth story of the past two decades.

With chief information officers racing to avoid being left behind, the analysts see trillions of dollars of additional investment still to come and believe the technology bull market has at least another two to three years to run.",Proactiveinvestors NA,2025-10-03T15:17:28Z,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1079685/bubble-or-are-we-are-we-at-the-start-of-an-ai-capex-super-cycle-1079685.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-04 00:22:55.348311,,0.223529411764706
META,"JEF Stock Falls 3.6% Since Q3 Earnings Beat, IB Income Solid","Shares of Jefferies Financial Group JEF have declined 3.6% since the announcement of its quarterly results on Sept. 29. Its third-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 31) adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. The bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 78 cents per share.

Results were aided by strong performance in higher capital markets revenues, solid performances in the investment banking (IB) and asset management businesses. However, higher expenses remain a spoilsport.

Net income attributable to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $224 million, up from $167.1 million in the prior-year quarter.

Jefferies’ Revenues Rise, Expenses Increase

Quarterly net revenues were $2.05 billion, up 21.6% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89 billion.

Total non-interest expenses were $1.72 billion, up 19.9% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in almost all cost components except the cost of sales.

As of Aug. 31, 2025, book value per common share was $50.60, up from $48.89 as of Aug. 31, 2024. Furthermore, the adjusted tangible book value per fully diluted share increased from $31.87 to $33.38.

JEF’s Quarterly Segment Performance

Investment Banking and Capital Markets: Net revenues were $1.86 billion, rising 14.7% from the prior-year quarter. The growth was driven by higher advisory revenues, equity and debt underwriting alongside robust equity and fixed income performance.

Asset Management: Net revenues were $176.9 million, a significant jump from $59 million in the year-ago quarter.

Jefferies’ Dividend Update

Concurrently, Jefferies announced a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Nov. 26, 2025, to shareholders as of Nov. 17.

Our View on JEF

A robust trading and asset management business, improved IB operations and strategic joint ventures and partnerships will offer support to some extent. However, elevated expenses due to higher compensation and exposure to geopolitical risk, given its global presence, will likely hurt Jefferies’ financials in the near term.

Bank of America BAC is slated to announce third-quarter 2025 results on Oct. 15.

Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC’s quarterly earnings has been revised 1.1% lower to 93 cents. This implies a 14.8% rise from the prior-year quarter.

META,A Meta Exec Explains Why Instagram Seems Like Spying On You  --  Can You Stop It?,"For years, Instagram, Facebook, and other Meta platforms have faced suspicion of spying on their users. Many people believe their private conversations trigger ads on the Instagram app shortly afterwards.

On 3 October 2025, Instagram head Adam Mosseri spoke publicly about the matter. In a Reel, he rejected the spying claims but admitted there are reasons why it appears that way. His remarks offered a direct response to one of the most persistent concerns about Meta.

Is Instagram Spying on Users? Here's What Meta Boss Said

Adam Mosseri, who leads Instagram at Meta, dismissed the long-standing rumour. He said the company does not use microphones to eavesdrop.

'We do not listen to you. We do not use the phone's microphone to eavesdrop on you', he said as reported by The Sun.

He explained that if the platform secretly used the microphone, users would notice warning signs. On iPhones, an orange dot signals microphone activity.

On Android, a microphone icon appears. He added that constant microphone use would drain a device's battery. Mosseri also stressed it would be a 'gross violation of privacy'.

Even so, he admitted some users would not be convinced. 'I know some of you are just not gonna believe me', he said.

Adam Mosseri Reveals Four Reasons Why It Might Be True

Mosseri outlined four main reasons why people suspect spying.

Prior searches or taps

He said users may have searched for an item online before a conversation. Those actions can later trigger related ads.

Friend or similar interest targeting

Instagram ads are based on behaviour of friends and people with shared interests. A product may appear because someone in a user's network engaged with it.

Unnoticed ads already viewed

He noted people often see ads without realising. Those ads can influence later conversations.

Coincidence

Sometimes, Mosseri admitted, it is simply random chance.

Top Apps Considered To Be Spying on You

According to the Digital Journal, a study by QR Code Generator reviewed 5,021 apps. It ranked Instagram and Facebook at the top with a score of 61.47 out of 100. Both collect 32 of 35 possible data types, with 25 directly linked to users.

Grab, a taxi and food delivery app, placed third with 55.57. It gathers financial details and precise locations. Threads, Meta Business Suite, and Messenger shared fourth place with 54.53 each. Pinterest ranked ninth with 50.06, collecting 29 types of data, including browsing history.

Marc Porcar, CEO of QR Code Generator PRO S.L, commented: 'In today's world, we are incredibly reliant on smartphones, but more specifically, apps – whether we use them for communication, shopping, or transport, they are used on a day-to-day basis'.

Anti-Spying Tips You Can Follow

Concerns about data tracking have pushed experts to advise stronger privacy practices. Here are simple steps for users.

Disable Instagram Web Tracking

In Settings & Privacy, go to Accounts Centre → Your Information & Permissions → Your Activity Off Meta Technologies. You can clear past activity and disconnect apps.

Watch Out for Microphone & Camera Indicators

On iPhone, an orange dot shows when the microphone is active. Android displays a microphone symbol.

Limit Permissions

Restrict Instagram's access to your microphone, camera, location, contacts, and photos in phone settings.

Use In-App Privacy Controls

In Meta's Accounts Centre, adjust ad personalisation settings. Turn off 'Activity from businesses' to reduce targeted ads.

Consider Paid Ad-Free Plans

Meta offers ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram. In the UK, subscriptions cost £3.99 monthly in-app or £2.99 via web.",International Business Times UK,2025-10-03T16:19:37Z,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/instagram-spying-you-meta-executive-reveals-four-reasons-why-it-seems-true-1746328,1.0,2025-10-04 00:23:12.560736,,-0.08235294117647063
META,"Meta's latest bid to get you into the metaverse is the Horizon Engine, promising 'infinite connected spaces, more realistic physics, and higher player counts'","Are you sick of hearing about the metaverse? Well, it seems like we aren't done yet, as Meta has been drip-feeding details about its upcoming Horizon Engine, a Meta-specific game engine built to create experiences in Meta Horizon. This was partially unveiled just a few weeks ago, but we've now got a few bold claims on the pipeline of creation in the engine, plus a link to sign up for the beta.

In a blog post titled ""Meta Horizon Engine at a glance"", Meta says the new engine focuses on a few major points: The first is 'Scalability from cloud to mobile', which is effectively the ability to run worlds on the cloud, and then on mobile devices. It mentions the idea of ""running on mobile phones"", which suggests you will be able to play worlds natively, which you couldn't do prior.

The second is ""speed and performance"". Meta claims worlds ""load and run quickly"" with its new engine.

The third is ""familiar tools"", and it says Horizon Engine will work with templates and formats that are designed to be familiar to developers. Given that Horizon Worlds are user-made, this could speed up production and lower the skill ceiling.

The last element is ""platform evolution"". Effectively, Meta argues that the building of this engine is an attempt to make a 'technical foundation', which will continue to grow alongside users. Projects that run for a long time rack up technical debt, so a fresh start allows a change of focus. Part of that change is Meta's attempt to design the platform ""from the ground up with user safety in mind.""

The Horizon Engine boasts support for tools like FMOD for sound, Noesis for UI, and PhysX for physics (that's a throwback). It supports Meta's own Avatars software and has bespoke rendering models. Two weeks ago, Mark Zuckerberg claimed, in the Meta Connect 2025, that the new engine can support five times as many people and that it's four times faster than before. This same announcement promised ""infinite connected spaces, more realistic physics, and higher player counts.""

I've spent some time in the current version of Meta Horizon Worlds and was not very impressed. In my time with it, it felt slow, hard to navigate, loaded with poorly made content, and otherwise bored me very quickly.

I have concerns around platforms like Fortnite, Meta, and Roblox using so much content that can be created by children, but the idea of them having access to creative tools that can be easily learned is potentially neat. The metaverse still has to deal with, well, the fact that it's the metaverse, though.

If you want to sign up for the Horizon Studio Beta, you can do so right now, but there's no word on when acceptance is likely to happen, other than at some point later this year. Meta Horizon Worlds are part of the broader Meta Horizon ecosystem, much like maps in Fortnite.

META,Rocket Companies Completes $14.2B All-Stock Acquisition of Mr. Cooper,"Rocket Companies, Inc. RKT has completed the acquisition of Mr. Cooper Group Inc. in terms of a $14.2 billion all-stock transaction. This deal marks the largest independent mortgage acquisition in U.S. history.

As a result of the acquisition, the combined company is expected to serve nearly 10 million clients, managing a $2.1 trillion unpaid principal balance, which represents roughly one in every six mortgages across the country.

Strategic Implications Behind Acquisition

The combination unites Mr. Cooper’s servicing operations with Rocket’s scale in mortgage origination and its growing real estate and technology platform. Together, the companies will create a comprehensive homeownership ecosystem spanning mortgage origination, servicing, real estate search, title and closing. As part of the transaction, Mr. Cooper and its servicing operations will transition under the Rocket brand.

The integration strengthens client relationships by offering more opportunities to access lending products across the homeownership journey — from initial purchase to refinancing and home equity solutions.

As announced in March, RKT expects the deal to generate $100 million in additional pre-tax revenues from higher recapture rates and other services, along with $400 million in pre-tax cost savings from streamlined operations and technology investments.

The acquisition enhances RKT’s data capabilities, adding nearly 7 million new clients and 150 million annual customer interactions. This expanded dataset will improve automation, personalization and overall operational efficiency. Moreover, the combined companies will benefit from a more balanced business model, allowing them to generate stable earnings across various interest rate environments.

Mr. Cooper Group & Rocket Companies’ Management Remarks

Jay Bray, then CEO of Mr. Cooper, stated that, “This transaction brings to a close a multi-year journey during which Mr. Cooper grew to become the nation's largest servicer and produced enormous value for our clients, partners, stakeholders and investors.”

Bray further added, “Now, by joining forces with Rocket, we start a new journey, which I believe offers an even bigger opportunity. Through the power of our platform and our people, we will create a more personalized experience that makes owning a home more attainable and easier to navigate. Together, we will deliver the change the housing industry needs.”

Varun Krishna, CEO and director of Rocket Companies, stated, ""Homeownership is the bedrock of the American Dream. By combining mortgage servicing and loan origination, along with home search through Redfin, we are paving the path for Americans to own the dream.""

Krishna further added, ""Jay Bray and his team have built a technology-driven platform that is the backbone of Mr. Cooper, helping it scale to become the largest servicer in the country. By integrating Mr. Cooper's servicing strength with Rocket's origination capabilities and AI technology and established strong national brand, our goal is to lower costs and make the process easier.""

RKT’s Price Performance & Zacks Rank

Over the past six months, shares of RKT have gained 32.6% compared with the industry’s 25.2% growth.

Acquisition by Other Finance Firms

In September 2025, Apollo Global Management, Inc. APO completed its previously announced acquisition of Bridge Investment Group Holdings Inc. The all-stock transaction, valued at $1.5 billion, was announced in February 2025.

The acquisition provides APO with immediate scale in real estate equity and enhances its origination capabilities across secular growth areas. Founded in 2009, Bridge manages approximately $50 billion in assets across residential, industrial and niche real estate verticals.

In the same month, BlackRock, Inc.BLK completed the acquisition of ElmTree Funds, LLC, a St. Louis–based real estate investment firm specializing in net-lease assets.

The deal is part of BLK’s long-term goal to raise $400 billion for private markets by 2030. The acquisition expands BlackRock’s private markets platform, giving clients broader access to alternative investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds.

META,Do Options Traders Know Something About Circle Internet Stock We Don't?,"Investors in Circle Internet Group, Inc. CRCL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct. 3, 2025 $182.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Circle Internet shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Circle Internet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 15 cents per share to 11 cents in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about Circle Internet right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

META,Affirm Teams Up With Ace Hardware to Expand Flexible In-Store Payments,"Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM has teamed up with Ace Hardware, making it easier for customers to enjoy more flexible payment options at checkout with convenient buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions in stores. This partnership marks a significant step in AFRM’s plan to integrate itself into everyday retail experiences while enhancing Ace Hardware’s appeal for shoppers who seek affordability without compromising quality.

Through this collaboration, customers at participating Ace locations can now split their purchases into more manageable payments, often with clear terms and no hidden fees. For those dealing with tighter budgets, this added flexibility can make it easier to buy large items for their backyard projects, lawn and home improvements. Customers need to just scan a QR code at checkout, complete a quick eligibility check, and they can access customized payment options for purchases starting at just $50.

The BNPL space has evolved from its e-commerce roots, making a stronghold in everyday retail. As consumers increasingly seek transparency and flexibility in managing their purchases, brick-and-mortar stores are jumping on BNPL solutions. This change is not just transforming the checkout process but also solidifying BNPL as a go-to financial option for many consumers.

AFRM continues to strengthen its foothold across both online and offline retail. By expanding into home improvement retail, the company could attract a wide range of customers and boost transaction volumes, which might help it achieve long-term growth. Its total transactions surged 51.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.

How Are Competitors Faring?

Some of AFRM’s competitors in the BNPL space are Mastercard Incorporated MA and Visa Inc. V.

Mastercard is stepping up its game in the BNPL space with the introduction of Mastercard Installments. This new program allows banks, lenders and fintech companies to provide BNPL options through Mastercard’s extensive network. Mastercard reported 16.8% year-over-year growth in net revenues in the second quarter of 2025.

Visa’s processed transactions increased 10% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Visa’s payment volume rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, along with 14% growth in net revenues.

META,Bet on 3 Solid Oilfield Services Stocks Despite Industry Headwinds,"Lower oil prices are likely to hurt exploration and production (E&P) activities, potentially affecting demand for oilfield services. Also, conservative capital management by upstream players is making the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas- Field Services industry gloomy.

Among the companies in the industry that are likely to survive the business challenges are TechnipFMC FTI, Archrock Inc AROC, and Core Laboratories CLB.

About the Industry

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry comprises companies that primarily provide support services to exploration and production players. These companies help in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining wells, drilling equipment, leasing of drilling rigs, seismic testing and transport and directional solutions, among others. Also, the firms help upstream energy players locate oil and natural gas and drill and evaluate hydrocarbon wells. Hence, oilfield services businesses are positively correlated to expenditures from upstream firms. Furthermore, with countries worldwide investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, a few oilfield service companies are extending their reach beyond the hydrocarbon fields and capitalizing on contracts for manufacturing equipment used in LNG facilities to decrease carbon emissions.

3 Trends Defining the Oilfield Services Industry's Future

Soft Oil Price to Hurt Oilfield Service Demand: The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) projects the spot average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for 2025 at $64.16 per barrel, lower than $76.6 in the last year. EIA projects the commodity price to plummet further to $47.77 per barrel in 2026. The declining crude prices, as expected by the EIA, will hurt E&P activities, which in turn will adversely impact demand for oilfield services, as oilfield service players assist upstream companies in effectively setting up oil and gas wells.

Lower Upstream Spending: Shareholders prefer E&P companies to return capital to them instead of spending money on producing more of the commodities. Thus, lower spending for E&P operations will directly hurt oilfield service demand.

Rising Renewable Energy Demand: The world is gradually preferring cleaner energy and renewable fuel. Thus, with the gradual decline in long-term demand for traditional fossil fuels like crude oil, the need for oilfield service companies will likely diminish.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Outlook

The Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services is a 21-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #140, which places it in the bottom 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Lags S&P 500 & Sector

The Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services industry has lagged the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year.

The industry has declined 5.5% over this period against the S&P 500’s rise of 20.5% and the broader sector’s 1.8% growth.

One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation

Since oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.

On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 6.68X compared with the S&P 500’s 18.65X and sector’s 5.11X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 12.87X and as low as 1.60X, with a median of 8.11X.

META,Will Starbucks' Store Uplifts Reset Economics and Customer Connection?,"Starbucks Corporation SBUX is embarking on a portfolio-wide refresh that aims to redefine both customer experience and unit-level efficiency. The company has introduced a new “coffeehouse uplift” program, allocating roughly $150,000 per store for quick, high-impact upgrades designed to reintroduce seating, enhance warmth and create more welcoming environments with minimal downtime.

The initiative is progressing rapidly, with early work already underway in New York City and Southern California is slated to follow later in the year. By the end of 2026, Starbucks expects to have completed at least 1,000 uplifts across North America. Management views these targeted investments as a cost-disciplined alternative to major renovations while also reinforcing the “Back to Starbucks” strategy focused on restoring community connection.

In tandem, Starbucks is piloting new store prototypes built to improve unit economics. One format, featuring 32 seats and a drive-thru, comes at a roughly 30% lower construction cost. A smaller 10-seat urban model is also in development, which is expected to unlock growth in dense markets. At the same time, the company plans to sunset its mobile-order-only pickup concept by fiscal 2026, citing a lack of brand warmth in the format. The pivot reflects Starbucks’ broader ambition to balance convenience with experiential value.

Management believes these moves will reinforce operational improvements from Green Apron Service by aligning physical space with service standards. By combining cost efficiency with renewed customer connection, Starbucks is betting that store design can become a durable lever for both transaction growth and margin recovery.

How It Stacks Up to Competitors

Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR is positioning remodels as a central lever for system health and profitability. In the second quarter of 2025, Burger King U.S., under Restaurant Brands International, completed roughly 400 remodels, with management highlighting mid-teens sales uplifts net of control. Restaurant Brands International further emphasized that these remodels enhance guest perception while improving franchisee EBITDA, strengthening the financial case for modernization. Supported by the refranchising of Carrols restaurants, where remodel execution is required for new operators, Restaurant Brands International is tightly linking modernization to operational alignment and long-term value creation.

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. CBRL is embedding physical refresh within a broader transformation plan aimed at guest relevance. Cracker Barrel management noted that fiscal 2026 will mark the formal rollout of its brand refinement strategy, incorporating updated restaurant designs and presentations across all guest touchpoints. The company is pairing this initiative with menu innovation and loyalty expansion to reinforce brand equity. Overall, Cracker Barrel’s refresh activity reflects an approach of aligning physical upgrades with evolving consumer expectations rather than focusing solely on throughput.

SBUX’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates

Shares of Starbucks have gained 5.7% in the past six months against the industry’s 1.2% decline.

NFLX,"'This Feels Different To Me,' Says Award-Winning Fund Manager","Just as pro football teams build success on the field around star franchise players, Invesco's Ron Zibelli constructs his top mutual fund around marquee stocks.

Zibelli, senior portfolio manager of Invesco American Franchise Fund (VAFIX), fills his portfolio with U.S. stocks that are stars in the sectors of the economy they do business in. ""We're looking for companies that stand out,"" Zibelli told IBD.

Top Mutual Fund Stands Out

Invesco American Franchise Fund is a 2025 IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. That means it beat the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ending Dec. 31, 2024.

So far this year, this top mutual fund is up 14.14% through Sept. 26, topping the S&P 500's 13.98% gain, according to fund tracker Morningstar. And over the past 10 years the fund's 16.18% annualized total return is a full percentage point better than the S&P 500's 15.12% gain.

IBD caught up with Zibelli, who also serves as Invesco's chief investment officer of growth equities, to learn more about his investing style.

IBD: How do you define a franchise, or star, stock?

Ron Zibelli: The fund's name does imply a lot about what we're looking for. We're seeking to identify and get to know companies that can generate durable, above-average growth so that we can capture the powerful benefit of compounding.

IBD: You're not looking for one-hit wonders, are you?

Zibelli: There's a relatively small number of companies that emerge from the pack and generate fantastic returns over long periods of time. And those are really the difference makers.

Winning Traits Top Mutual Fund Looks For

IBD: What are key traits of difference makers?

Zibelli: These companies tend to be run by accomplished management teams that have demonstrated the ability to execute on a business plan. They tend to have leading market positions, or a superior product or business model that gives them durable advantage. Oftentimes, they're really transcending what's going on in their sector of the economy.

IBD: The fund seeks ""unrecognized, underappreciated"" names but you own all the Magnificent Seven. Explain.

Zibelli: I find that the biggest misperception about the stock market's greatest winners has to do with sustainability. So, the stock goes up. It gets a lot of attention. People point (to negatives).

IBD: So, what are they missing?

Zibelli: They underestimate the future compounding that's still yet to occur. There's just a lack of understanding that certain companies have characteristics where that above-average growth is durable. And it's going to keep going, and it's going to keep compounding.

IBD: Are you saying the best stocks are ones you buy and hold?

Zibelli: The mistake many investors make is that they sell too soon and, therefore, they give up on that tremendous long-term compounding benefit that comes with staying with the greatest winners.

Big Bets On Big Stocks

IBD: So, that's why you own Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL)?

Zibelli: We don't claim to have some information edge on the very largest companies. We think about the portfolio in two pieces: our top 10 holdings and everything else.

IBD: Every name matters, right?

Zibelli: With the top 10, we're going to have less of an advantage in information because those are so well followed and so aggressively researched. But we do have a view on each one and do add value. But as you go down the market-cap scale into the midcap range, that's where we can add even more value and can really differentiate with our research.

IBD: How do you add value?

Zibelli: It's not always about a single company. We identify patterns and trends in the economy that have the wind at their back and groups of companies that are better benefiting from trends driving outsize growth. We position the portfolio in themes.

Top Mutual Fund Finds Moneymaking Themes

IBD: What themes do you like now?

Zibelli: We have a couple of themes right now in our portfolios, where we see that extra impetus of growth. That obviously includes artificial intelligence (AI). But it also includes what we see as an industrial renaissance in the United States. And a big cyclical upturn in capital markets-oriented companies, as both merger and acquisition activity and IPOs emerge from a recessionary stretch over the past two years.

IBD: Your fact sheet says your research focuses on objective information. What does that mean?

Zibelli: We narrow it down to the critical few drivers that determine the outcome for each security. We look at the correlations of key performance indicators (KPIs) with stock price performance. We hone in on certain metrics that we think are most important for each company's stock. We're not trying to ingest all information about every company. There's so much. It's about what you do with it and what you focus on that really matters. The mistake is trying to ingest too much information. You just get overloaded.

IBD: Why are you high on AI stocks like your No. 1 holding Nvidia?

Zibelli: It speaks to the themes I referenced. Two and a half years ago, (Nvidia CEO) Jensen Huang kicked off the artificial intelligence revolution. Nvidia announced a tremendously strong quarter in the spring of 2023, and Huang said this is a starting gun going off on AI.

AI Is Just Getting Started

IBD: That got your attention?

Zibelli: We dropped everything as a team. We put AI at the top of our list, and said we're going to research the entire ecosystem of opportunity presented by this revolution. And we ended up populating our portfolios with a range of companies in different sectors of the economy that would be participating in this artificial intelligence revolution, primarily around building the infrastructure. And the buildout is still going on today, two-and-a-half years later.

IBD: Are a lot of your holdings connected to AI?

Zibelli: We hold companies in the industrial sector, the energy sector, the utility sector, the technology sector, obviously, and in communication services that are all feeding into this ecosystem of opportunity around AI.

IBD: What is the thesis for this notion of a U.S. industrial renaissance?

Zibelli: It's a combination of things stimulated by federal investment, reduced regulations and innovation. There's a tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus that's encouraging domestic investment.

Tailwinds Lift Other Areas For Top Mutual Fund

IBD: Are there other sectors benefiting from tailwinds?

Zibelli: Technology driven innovation has created a strong demand impetus across a range of industrial brands and companies, including the commercial aerospace industry as well as increased demand from the defense establishment.

IBD: You're also bullish on capital markets companies. Why?

Zibelli: Really, post-Covid, we've been in a bit of a depression when it comes to acquisition activity and initial public offering (IPO) activity on Wall Street. We've been in an environment where companies were staying private longer and policies of (the prior White House administration) deterred folks from considering business combinations.

IBD: What changed — the more business-friendly government policies?

Zibelli: What we're seeing right now on both fronts is an inflection in growth and an opening of the window, so to speak. You're seeing a big pickup in merger-and-acquisition (M&A) activity on the order of, say, 30% increase this year. And IPOs are really starting to come into the mix again. So, we think the capital market-oriented companies are going to enjoy a significant cyclical rebound here. And, of course, a number of those companies also participate in the asset management business, which is benefiting from increased market values.

Know When To Sell

IBD: What's your sell strategy?

Zibelli: We're always thinking about the relative growth prospects of companies. We have a robust opportunity set in today's economy. There are a lot of growth stocks that are thriving. So, companies that are not living up to our expectations, whether it's on those key performance indicators that we focus on, or just not meeting our expectations (are sell possibilities). We're pretty strict about having a sell discipline. We will upgrade the portfolio. How? We will sell that security and go buy an alternative name that's usually in the same sector, but one we think has (a better outlook). We have limited tolerance for disappointment. It's like that classic strategy: sell your losers quickly and let your winners run. That's our philosophy.

IBD: There's been increasing talk of a bubble. Do you buy into that narrative?

Zibelli: I've lived through bubbles. And this feels different to me. And the reason it does is because the fundamental support for the increase in values of companies is there. You can find big winners sprinkled around throughout the market. But the fundamentals are real. Revenue growth, cash flows, earnings, they're coming in strong. The latest quarterly profit reports for corporate America were great on both revenue and earnings, and cash flows. It's not hype. It's real numbers.

IBD: So, it's not a bubble?

Zibelli: Valuations are at the high end of historical averages, but they are supported by this sustained, strong fundamental backdrop. The resilient economy. Both fiscal and monetary support that you're getting in the markets. Plus, a tremendous wave of technology driven innovation. So, I don't think we're at bubble status as a result.

In a post on X, Musk told followers to Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids, joining conservative criticism of the animated show Dead End Paranormal Park, which featured a transgender character before being canceled in 2023. He also responded to claims about the show's creator that fueled backlash online.

Hamish Steele, the show's creator, responded on Bluesky, calling it a very odd day and sharing support from TV writers who described the show as positive and inclusive. Netflix has not commented.

The headlines weighed on Netflix stock, which is down 4% this week. But analysts say Musk's call for a boycott is unlikely to dent results. The company has more than 300 million subscribers worldwide and a nearly $490 billion market value. Analysts at Wedbush and others noted that any cancellations could be offset by rising ad revenue, and some viewers may even sign up in response to the backlash.

Traders compared the moment to past boycotts against consumer brands but expect this one to fade quickly. Netflix's next earnings report later this month will give investors a clearer view of whether the controversy had any real impact.

NFLX,"Musk Vs. Buffett: Tesla CEO Goes 'Cancel Netflix,' While Oracle Of Omaha Streams Live Boxing","Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) released many hit shows and movies in the third quarter, but now faces the possibility of subscribers cancelling their memberships thanks to the world's richest person.

But, while Elon Musk was telling people to cancel their Netflix memberships, another billionaire could provide a boost by supporting the company's live sports efforts.

Musk Says ‘Cancel Netflix'

Tesla CEO and world's richest man Elon Musk took to the social media platform X, which he owns, to encourage Netflix subscribers to cancel their subscriptions.

Musk shared several posts on social media from others that encouraged the cancellations.

""Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,"" Musk tweeted.

Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends

The support to ""cancel Netflix"" by Musk comes after accounts shared a clip from animated Netflix original ""Dead End: Paranormal Park.""

The show has a transgender character and also comes with a Y7 rating, with several accounts saying this means the show is targeted at children and pushing trans ideals on kids.

A report from Variety says the show ran for two seasons and was later cancelled in 2023, but all episodes remain available to stream on the platform.

The series creator Hamish Steele shared several posts on social media saying Netflix is not promoting the show.

This is not the first time Musk has told his more than 200 million followers on X to cancel streaming subscriptions. In 2023, he previously told his followers and supporters to cancel Disney+ and Hulu as he waged war against the media company over advertising on X.

The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) may have lost 1.7 million streaming subscribers recently due to their suspension of late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.

Oracle of Omaha Stands In Netflix's Corner

Netflix could see a rush of cancellations and the term, ""cancel Netflix"", hit its second-highest mark on Google Trends in the past 12 months.

The good news is the company had key content in the third quarter and the current fourth quarter that could help bring in new subscribers — and it received some support from billionaire Warren Buffett.

It's not every day companies get public support from the Berkshire Hathaway chairman, especially if he's not a shareholder.

But that's what happened to Netflix last month, thanks to its live and exclusive boxing fight card that featured the title fight between Canelo Alvarez and Terence Crawford.

Crawford, who is from Omaha, Nebraska, like Buffett, counts Buffett as a friend and supporter, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Buffett admitted he stayed up late to watch Crawford win the fight. Netflix later reported that 41 million people, including Buffett, watched the boxing match.

""I'm a huge fan,"" Buffett said. ""There's nothing in the world that would cause me to stay up until after midnight on a Saturday.""

This was a huge free endorsement for Netflix and came from one of the most followed figures in the world.

Buffett has attended ""six or seven"" of Crawford's past fights and has become a strong supporter.

""Bud is all Omaha. He emphasizes his Omaha heritage every chance he gets.""

The Alvarez vs. Crawford boxing match was one of several marquee Netflix items for streamers during the third quarter. The company also released new seasons of ""Squid Game"" and ""Wednesday"" in the third quarter.

Netflix also released the sleeper hit ""KPop Demon Hunters"" in the third quarter, but much of its success may have come in the fourth quarter.

Speaking of the fourth quarter, the subscribers who listened to Musk and canceled their Netflix account will miss out on the new season of ""Stranger Things,"" two exclusive NFL Christmas Day games and several other upcoming fourth-quarter content releases.

The streaming giant no longer shares how many subscribers it gained or lost each quarter or its overall count, but other financial metrics could show if Musk's social media call-out hurt the results.

Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $6.97 and revenue of $11.52 billion for the third quarter when they report on Oct. 21.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in six straight quarters and beaten estimates for revenue in eight straight quarters.

Netflix Stock Falls

Netflix stock closed Wednesday down 2.34% to $1,170.90 versus a 52-week trading range of $677.88 to $1,341.15. Netflix stock is up 31.37% year-to-date in 2025.
