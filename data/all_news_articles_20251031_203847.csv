The Interim Financial Statements, Management Discussion and Analysis and financial certifications have been filed on SEDAR+ and can be viewed on the Company's investor website at https://investhps.com/ . CEO and Founder Francois Byrne states: “As we continue to build momentum in the clean energy sector despite ongoing economic headwinds across Canada and the United States, Hybrid Power Solutions is strategically focused on reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities to North America, expanding our distributor network with exciting new strategic partnerships, and accelerating research and development through targeted collaborations—seizing tremendous sales opportunities that have resulted in a significant number of new confirmed orders as our innovative solutions gain traction in key markets. While Q1 revenue reflects a deliberate shift in resources toward these foundational initiatives—combined with CUSMA-related tariff uncertainty impacting cross-border sales and creating short-term headwinds—these achievements have been driven by relentless product improvements and a disciplined focus on cost control, leading to notably reduced expenses. Most importantly, explosive growth in AI data centers is driving unprecedented demand for resilient, fuel-free power, with our scalable microgrid-capable Terra systems delivering seamless integration for distributed energy networks in high-density computing environments, while fleet purchases of Batt Pack units, extensive demonstration programs, and active pilot deployments with Canadian transit agencies, construction firms, and universities validate real-world performance and reliability. Our team's unwavering dedication ensures that we not only adapt to challenges but turn them into catalysts for long-term success, positioning us to lead in both portable and grid-scale microgrid solutions while driving sustained growth, resilience regardless of market conditions, and long-term shareholder value.""",TheNewswire,2025-10-30 19:30:00-04:00,Neutral,Article,HPSIF,"earnings,PressRelease",2025-10-31 20:38:47.213693
