"Market Wrap- Top Stocks: Tesla, Intuitive Surgical","The earnings season has sent the market into a scramble. Strong reports from major banks last week sent the market soaring, followed by Tuesday’s estimate miss from Netflix and electric-vehicle numbers from Tesla after the market close, which had all four US indices slipping on Wednesday.
- The S&P 500 slipped 0.5%, held mainly by the immense gain in Intuitive Surgical’s stock.
- The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.9%, ahead of the earnings release from EV giant Tesla, which also marks the start of reports from the Magnificent Seven.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.8%, with several prominent names, including Apple, Goldman Sachs, Amazon, and Salesforce, falling.
- The small-cap Russell 2000 suffered significantly, closing down 1.5%.
It’s not just the earnings or the preview that had the market stirring on Wednesday. Following a Reuters report stating that the White House is considering a plan to restrict exports of a wide range of products to China, the indices fell even lower, increasing uncertainty.
Gold prices continued to edge lower, declining intraday before gaining 0.4% near the close. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield remained below the 4% mark, but oil prices gained around 4% on Wednesday.
Tesla’s stock was down 0.8% at the close, ahead of anticipated Q3 earnings, and continued to slide after the closing bell, down 3.8% at last check. Intuitive Surgical’s stock was up 13.8%, credited to its second consecutive positive earnings report.
Tomorrow, we can look forward to reports from Intel, Honeywell, T-Mobile, and Blackstone, among others.
Here are the most active stocks today
Five S&P 500 stocks making big moves today are:
- Intuitive Surgical: +13.9%
- Avery Dennison: +9.5%
- Halliburton Co: +4.2%
- SLB: +4.1%
- Boston Scientific Corp: +3.9%
The worst-performing five S&P 500 stocks today are:
- Lennox International: -10.2%
- Netflix Inc: -10.1%
- Quanta Services Inc: -5.8%
- On Semiconductor Corp: -5.7%
- Texas Instruments: -5.6%
Stocks also worth noting include:
Are earnings a success or a miss for Tesla?
Tesla shares, which were in focus on Wednesday before the earnings release, dropped 0.8% intraday and were down nearly 4% after closing.
However, the EV maker reported a profitable quarter, with $28.1 billion in total revenue, marking a 12% year-over-year increase. While it reported a fresh cash flow of nearly $4 billion, its operating margins slipped to 5.8% due to a 40% year-over-year decrease in operating income to $1.6 billion.
More Tesla:
- Tesla shareholders respond to latest push against Elon Musk
- Tesla’s surprising delivery data hide a serious problem
- Tesla Q3 report needs to show a clear future
It cited higher operating expenses, investments in AI initiatives, R&D, and a one-time reduction in fully self-driving revenue recognition as primary reasons for the decrease in operating income.
While the company highlighted growth in its energy and AI-driven businesses, it also flagged “near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy,” and a focus on “long-term growth and value creation,” in the shareholder’s note.
Last week, Melium Research analyst Rob Wertheimer initiated coverage of Tesla with a Buy rating and a $520 price target because of confidence in Tesla’s ability to deliver on its potential success in autonomous vehicles.
However, BNP Paribas Exane analyst James Picariello was bearish on the EV stock and had an Underperform rating with a $307 target price for Tesla, arguing that autonomous ventures remain speculative.
Barclays raised its price target to $350 from $275, maintaining an Equal Weight rating, suggesting that Tesla will enter Q3 earnings with two “contrasting” stories, marked by an ambitious AI narrative and a weakening fundamental backdrop, as reported at TheFly.
High-end surgical instruments resilient
Intuitive Surgical, manufacturer of the da Vinci and Ion endoluminal system, emerged as a top performer on Wednesday, trading 13.9% higher.
Specializing in robot-assisted surgery, the company’s stock has gained 20% over the past week, driven by robust earnings.
Intuitive Surgical topped Wall Street expectations in a second straight quarter of more than 20% revenue and earnings per share growth, signaling rising healthcare capital spending and investment in high-cost productivity-enhancing technologies.
Analysts are mostly optimistic about its future growth, with RBC Capital raising its price target to $625 from % $615, maintaining an Outperform rating.
And Mizuho analyst Anthony Petrone raised the price target to $575 from $520, while maintaining a Neutral rating, citing that while the company can maintain its “bellwether” growth, its growth is already priced into the shares, as reported by TheFly.
Meanwhile, Baird’s increase to $655 from $536, with an Outperform rating, on the beat and raise in Q3 bucks the bear thesis overhang.",TheStreet,2025-10-23T03:28:31Z,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/market-wrap-top-stocks-tesla-intuitive-surgical,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:20.426587
US stocks end sharply higher as earnings optimism fuels risk appetite,"Synopsis

U.S. stocks jumped on Monday with finance and technology shares providing much of the upside muscle, as upbeat quarterly earnings results revived risk appetite and investors grew less fearful about regional bank credit quality.

U.S. stocks jumped on Monday with finance and technology shares providing much of the upside muscle, as upbeat quarterly earnings results revived risk appetite and investors grew less fearful about regional bank credit quality. A broad rally sent all three major U.S. stock indexes to a sharply higher close. The small cap Russell 2000 outperformed its larger counterparts, rising 2.0%.

""It's a good, solid, across-the-board move, there's not a lot of negative in the market,"" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois. ""There's some relief from the financials ... investors are looking at it as maybe a bit of an overreaction on the downside last week.""

""As far as the market's concerned, everything is wonderful again."" Apple stock touched a record high, while Meta, Netflix and Alphabet gained between 1.3% and 3.3%.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index breached an all-time high, ending the session up 1.6%.

Third quarter earnings season has shifted into high gear. Notable results this week include Tesla, Netflix , IBM, Intel, GM and Ford, along with a spate of other high-profile industrial firms, including aerospace, transports and diversified manufacturers. Upcoming U.S. regional bank results are expected to provide a closer read of the sector on the heels of last week's selloff, which was driven by fears of systemic credit stress.

Live Events

Analysts currently expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth, on aggregate, of 9.3% year-on-year, marking an improvement over their 8.8% growth estimate as of October 1.

""A lot of the uncertainty that the businesses were concerned about -- tax legislation, the tariffs -- earlier this year has subsided for the time being, and that's allowed companies to focus on earnings and profitability,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. Sentiment was given an extra boost by White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett, who said the federal government shutdown is likely to end this week.

With the federal shutdown entering day 20, investors and policymakers have had to feel their way forward amid the resulting data blackout. But on Friday the Labor Department will make an exception by releasing its September consumer price index (CPI), which will provide the data dependent U.S. Federal Reserve with a glimpse at the state of inflation and perhaps an indication regarding the extent to which President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting price growth.

In the ongoing trade skirmish between Washington and Beijing, Trump suggested easing tariffs on China if Beijing resumes key agricultural purchases including soybeans. Trump blamed the latest showdown on China's rare earth export controls.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 515.97 points, or 1.12%, to 46,706.58, the S&P 500 gained 71.12 points, or 1.07%, to 6,735.13 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 310.57 points, or 1.37%, to 22,990.54.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, communication services enjoyed the largest percentage gain, while consumer staples and utilities inched lower. Among other stock moves, Boeing advanced 1.8% after the planemaker won approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to raise 737 MAX production to 42 planes per month. WeightWatchers surged 9.3% following the company's announcement that it would partner with Amazon for weight-loss drug delivery.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 345 new highs and 47 new lows on the NYSE.

On the Nasdaq, 3,599 stocks rose and 1,078 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.34-to-1 ratio.

The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 69 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.50 billion shares, compared with the 20.21 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

"Stock Market Today: Stocks Jump, Apple Notches New All-Time High on iPhone 17 Report","This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.
Happy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Oct. 20, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.
Update: 4:00 p.m. ET
Closing Bell
The U.S. markets are now closed. The small cap-focused Russell 2000 (+1.83%) soldiered up after suffering from private credit angst last week, closing out just shy of the 2.5K mark, while the Nasdaq Composite (+1.43%) rose back above 23K with a healthy run of its own. The Dow (+1.15%) and S&P 500 (+1.12%) both rose. Gold prices also continued to run.
Update: 12:45 p.m. ET
Midday Movers
Past the midday hump, the Russell 2000 (+1.47%), Nasdaq (+1.34%), S&P 500 (+0.99%), and Dow (+0.93%) are all higher. 73.1% (4,060) of U.S-listed firms are on the rise, while 24.4% (1,352) are declining. The Continuous Gold Futures Contract (+3.59%) is also an all-star today, approaching $4,400.
Looking specifically at firms with at least a $2 billion market capitalization, here’s what is making moves today:
Movers
Celcuity (+39.59%), Cleveland-Cliffs (mentioned below, +21%), and Navitas Semiconductor Corp (+16.7%) are at the top of our list today.
Today’s list skews towards healthcare, especially biotech, which has its fair share of representation. Names like GRAIL (+16%), Recursion Pharmaceuticals (+16%), and Beam Therapeutics (+13.2%) aren’t far behind the leaders.
Losers
In losers today, OBOOK Holdings (-27.2%), Exelixis (-13.2%), and Glaukos Corporation (-11.9%) are atop the losers. We wouldn’t fault you if you’ve never heard of any of these companies.
There are a few you might know, though. New listing Fermi Inc (-9.9%) is in the bottom 20, so too is e.l.f. Beauty (-7.6%) and CoreWeave (-5.8%). Those who saw our S&P 500 commentary might also recognize the mention of Seagate, Oracle, and Western Digital.
Update: 12:29 p.m. ET
S&P 500: Moderna, Super Micro lead; Seagate and Oracle drag
Heading into midday, the S&P 500 is up 1%. Among the most visible names on the heatmap today, Apple (+4.45%) is near all-time highs, while Oracle (-4.85%) is sagging.
At the top of the index, Moderna (+6.8%), Super Micro Computer (+6.34%), and ON Semiconductor (+6.2%) are leading the charge in the index today. Advanced Micro Devices (+3.4%), which recently announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, is hitting an all-time high today.
Seagate Technology (-6.24%) and Western Digital (-4.4%), among the two of best-performing stocks in the index, are sagging today after a fantastic few weeks of growth for the storage giants. Oracle and Applovin (-4.32%) round out the other worst-performing names today.
Here’s how it looks at 6,728:
Update: 12:09 p.m. ET
Financials Lead Russell 2000 As They Continue Post-Private Credit Scare Comeback
The surprising collapse of auto brands First Brands and Tricolor have stirred renewed worries about a hot, hidden part of the market: private credit.
An apparent collapse in the brands saw regional bank stocks sell off late last week. However, there’s evidence of a modest rebound in the making. Just see the Russell 2000, which counts financials as its largest component:
The spell of confidence in the financial sector after last week’s worries continues today, with the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF now up 3.24% since its after hours close on Thursday. That has helping to eliminate most of the week-over-week losses.
But still, the index has swung wildly and lower over the past month; down 6.5%. It’ll be something to watch, especially with the R2K’s concentration in the sector.
Update: 11:21 a.m. ET
Apple’s New Phones One-Up Last Gen
Apple is up more than 4% today, sitting just below all-time highs, after a report showed that sales of its new iPhone 17 outstripped sales of the last-gen handset in the U.S. and China.
The report from Counterpoint Research said that the new series “outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% in its first 10 days of availability in China and the U.S.” with the base model iPhone 17 leading the charge.
Apple’s new iPhone Air was also seen scoring points for the company, showing out more popular than the now-retired iPhone 16 Plus in its domestic debut.
The iPhone 17 Pro Max has also appreciated “the strongest ramp in demand” as major U.S. carriers boost subsidies.
Strong sales represent a big win for the tech giant, which seems to be benefiting this time, despite a longer upgrade cycle. The company, which is up 12% this year, has lagged other megacap players amid slower handset sales and a struggle to bring AI features into its software ecosystem.
Update: 10:04 a.m. ET
Conference Board Delays Leading Index
The CB Leading Index, arguably the lead piece of economic data that investors might have been anticipating today, has been delayed. Understandably so.
The index, which is constructed by the Conference Board, aims to predict the future of the business cycle. However, in the absence of some of the data points necessary to construct the September data, the organization decided to delay, rather than substitute for key inputs.
The report, along with dozens of others, have been held up by the ongoing government shutdown. Today is the 20th day of the shutdown, making it the third-longest in history per data from Vanguard.
Update: 9:32 a.m. ET
Opening Bell
The U.S. markets are open for business. The small-cap Russell 2000 (+1.66%) is seen recovering from last week’s regional bank tumult, while the Nasdaq (+0.83%) leads the large cap pack, trailed by the S&P 500 (+0.65%) and Dow (+0.52%).
Here are some of the other highlights this morning:
Gold Glimmers
Gold is also a highlight today, with spot prices up nearly 2%, above $4,300. The precious metal has continued to rally this year amid the popularization of a U.S. debasement trade, as well as speculation on commodities during higher-than-background levels of inflation.
AWS Outage
As the sun begins to rise on America’s West coast, many are also waking up to an overnight treat from the U.S. East. Specifically, us-east-1. An internet outage at Amazon‘s AWS affected hundreds of websites overnight and into this morning, affecting social app Snapchat, education software company Instructure, and brokerage apps Robinhood and Webull.
The late night crowd flagged the outage on Downdetector just before 1 a.m. ET this morning, with over 5,000 reports. Reports are also mounting this morning, reflecting the ongoing nature of the outage.
Cleveland-Cliffs Focuses on Rare Earths
During its earnings this morning, steel giant Cleveland-Cliffs announced that it would “re-focus” on upstream mining assets, namely rare-earth minerals, sending the company’s stock soaring over 20%. The exploratory effort will see the company focus on sites in Michigan and Minnesota for starters, seeking to carve out a corner in the buzzy field.
Aside from the announcement, the company announced so-so earnings this morning, with a net loss of $234 million on $4.7 billion. The profit expectations beat consensus, but the revenue expectations were a miss, especially considering new steel tariffs.
WeightWatchers + Amazon
WeightWatchers announced a partnership which will offering a new option for customers to get GLP-1 weight loss drugs: Amazon.
The company says that the new option will allow customers to see whether branded weight loss drugs are “in stock” and have the refrigerated drugs delivered through Amazon Pharmacy. However, patients can also have prescriptions filled through other pharmacies.
The company’s stock jumped over 7% at the open. Still, WeightWatchers faces its fair share of difficulties. After filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy in May to wipe out over a billion in debt and returning to market in July, the stock has retreated from recent highs.
Update: 7:42 a.m. ET
Everything Happening (That We Know Of)
Good morning. By many measures, earnings season could be getting off to a better start. While a narrow band of equities lifted U.S. indexes last week, jitters around China tariffs, private credit risks with regional banks, and the expiration of enhanced health care credits have overshadowed some healthy showings among early reporters.
But we’ve only just gotten started with earnings season, which has the potential to mask some of those bigger concerns. But with weak earnings revisions weighing on early reports, such as banks and consumer brands, investors will need to see a widening of the trade this week. Dozens of report are coming down the line, including Tesla, Netflix, Procter & Gamble, GE Aerospace, and IBM.
Their reports could help the market escape some of the pockets of tumult and continue to soldier upwards. Alternatively, they could create an opportunity for some undoing. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson says the S&P 500 could decline “up to 11%” if these worries continue to prove overbearing for some investors to ignore.
In the meantime, the index is up this morning. Futures for all four major indexes are, in fact, as the government shutdown prepares to enter its fourth week. As of this morning, the shutdown is now the third-longest in history, with no signs of abating anytime soon.
Earnings Today: W.R. Berkley, Steel Dynamics, Summit Therapeutics
Monday is generally slow during earnings season. Data from TipRanks has us good for 24 reports today, including reports from W.R. Berkley, Steel Dynamics, and Cleveland-Cliffs, among others. Boiling over from last week’s early bank reports, here’s a shortlist of the top firms set to report today:
Economic Events & Data
Up to this point, it hasn’t been much of a problem for investors that the government is shut and “official” labor and inflation numbers have been absent from their media diet. They’ve have learned to live by handful of privately-ran reports such as ADP, consumer sentiment insights, and freight data; plus, commentary from various Fed Governors who are still making their rounds during the political standoff.
This week, investors will finally get one piece of BLS-issued data in the September Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is widely-anticipated to have seen little change in the month. Refreshed data from the index has been promised by the agency despite the shutdown, which brought back staff to finish the index to move along Cost of Living Adjustments.
Here are today’s scheduled events, per TradingEconomics (in Pacific Time). Worth noting, though, we might not receive some of them as planned:",TheStreet,2025-10-20T14:48:33Z,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stock-market-today-stocks-seen-higher-as-government-shutdown-notches-new-record,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:20.427698
"Weekly Stock Market Update: Apple, Taiwan Semiconductor and Novo Nordisk","It was a volatile but ultimately positive week on Wall Street, marked by renewed tensions in the U.S.-China trade war and a strong start to the earnings season. Major banks exceeded expectations, while regional lenders expressed concern over delinquencies, which kept the market in a state of flux.
- The S&P 500 rose 1.7% this week, despite being impacted by tariff threats mid-week.
- The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1% this week, driven by continued reliance on AI.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a 1.6% gain this week, while the small-cap Russell 2000, despite closing 0.6% lower on Friday, finished the week up 2.4%, primarily due to a midweek gain.
President Donald Trump slightly eased uncertainty over a possible renewal of the trade war with China, acknowledging that the 100% tariffs he threatened, effective November 1st, were not sustainable.
However, the CBOE Volatility or ‘Fear’ Index, which closed 17% lower on Friday, has seen a 32% rise this month, signaling the market push and pull. Visibly, the market is calm, with increased optimism on returns on the heavy investments in artificial intelligence infrastructures, but investors remain alert to geopolitical and policy uncertainties.
Adding to optimism were strong Q3 earnings from major banks, such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and, more recently, American Express, which showed increased customer spending and deposits.
However, job growth is low, and layoffs are mounting. The ongoing government shutdown is also beginning to impact regional banks, adding to their existing concerns over bad commercial real estate loans and loan fraud risk.
In commodities, Gold crossed the $4,200 per troy ounce mark, up 6.7% this week, and a short squeeze in London pushed Silver to a record high, up 7% over the week.
Rare earths, energy, and soybeans have been at the forefront of global trade discussions this week, with China expanding Its Export Control over rare earths and ceasing to buy soybeans from the US.
The increased expansion of data centers to fuel AI infrastructure and cloud computing puts pressure on traditional energy suppliers, prompting them to seek alternative sources.
From xAI to OpenAI to CoreWeave, Nvidia is building AI’s infrastructure, although missed chances are piling up.
Faizan Farooque
This led to the rising price of rare earth stocks, along with the Trump administration’s increased equity holdings in these companies, such as MP Materials and Lithium Americas.
Bunge, a US-based cooking oil manufacturer, also benefited from President Trump’s interest in domestic cooking oil producers during the trade dispute with China.
Looking ahead, Netflix, Tesla, Coca-Cola, Intel, Ford and T-Mobile, among others, will release earnings next week.
The stocks that made big moves this week were TSMC, up 5% over the week, Apple, up 3% this week, bringing its quarter-to-date return to 19%, and Novo Nordisk, which was down 4.5% this week.
Apple is upping its revenue sources
Apple stock rose 1.9% on Friday and marked a 2.9% gain for the week following the announcement of a significant deal for Formula 1 broadcasting.
Apple is expanding its revenue sources by securing highly leveraged deals for its streaming service, Apple TV. On Friday, it officially announced a 5-year contract, valued at $700 million, to broadcast Formula 1 races exclusively on Apple TV, free for its subscribers.
Previously, ESPN held the exclusive broadcast rights for F1 racing.
Apple also announced a new bundle with NBCUniversal’s Peacock in a “first-of-its-kind initiative” to redefine customer journey, while “broadening the reach of Peacock to even more audiences,” said Matt Strauss, Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group.
Additionally, Apple is working on a touch-screen MacBook and exploring robotics and smart home devices, according to a Bloomberg report.
TSMC continues to lead in semiconductor manufacturing
The stock of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing was up 5% over the week, despite closing 1.6% lower on Friday.
More Nvidia:
- Goldman Sachs tweaks Nvidia’s stock price target with a twist
- Fund manager drops bombshell call on Nvidia stock
- Amazon’s new Alexa feature impacts Nvidia
On Friday, TSMC and AI giant Nvidia unveiled the first Blackwell wafer produced on U.S. soil, marking a significant milestone in a three-decade-long partnership.
Adding, “This is a historic moment for several reasons. It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States.”
Highlighting the semiconductor giant’s solid AI-driven demand and resilient gross margin, Citi increased its price target on TSMC to NT$1,800 from NT$1,600, keeping a Buy rating.
Analyst Simon Coles at Barclays also views TSMC’s strong Q3 results and growing AI demand as reasons to increase the price target to $355 from $330, with an Overweight rating, as reported by TheFly.
Novo Nordisk is on a losing streak
Despite announcing a U.S. FDA-approved GLP-1 medication, Rybelsus, the stock of healthcare company Novo Nordisk fell 4.5% this week, extending losses to 12% this month and a 36.8% loss year-to-date.
As demand for the weight-loss drugs surges, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) is warning consumers to watch out for a new wave of scams preying on people trying to access GLP-1 medications.
Dana Sullivan Kilroy
This followed President Trump’s comments on the prices of fat loss drugs to be at $150 or less, on which Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator, stressed that the prices had not been negotiated yet.
The oral GLP-1 drug Rybelsus reduces cardiovascular risks in adults with Type 2 diabetes.
More recently, Novo Nordisk also signed an asset purchase and licensing deal worth $2.1 billion with Omeros Corporation, for zaltenibart, a rare-disease therapy targeting blood and kidney disorders.
“Zaltenibart has a novel mode of action that could offer several advantages over other treatments for complement-mediated diseases.” Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research & Development at Novo Nordisk.

"Top Stocks: Walmart, Bunge Global, and AMD","After a mixed market performance on Tuesday, when major indices slipped at the close despite intraday gains, Wednesday opened on a bullish note.
- The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, driven by robust earnings releases and amid geopolitical tensions.
- The NASDAQ composite was up 0.6%, crediting, once again, to AI interest.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, slipped 0.04% nearer the closing bell.
- The Russell 2000, up 0.8% recorded a second consecutive high on Wednesday.
Gold remains unbeaten, up 1.4%, benefiting from the uncertainty of trade wars, the same geopolitical tensions that caused oil to slip 0.3% on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump posted that China’s decision not to buy soybeans from the U.S. was purposeful and was “an Economically Hostile Act.”
Consequently, the stock price of Bunge Global SA, a global agribusiness and food company, surged 12.9%.
Meanwhile, expansion with artificial intelligence continues to provide gains for associated companies, with Walmart’s stock up 1.7% after a new deal with OpenAI.
AMD continues to gain, with its stock up 9.4% on Wednesday following analyst upgrades and AI deals.

Walmart enters the agentic commerce race
After Etsy became the first to collaborate with ChatGPT’s instant checkout, Walmart is ushering in a new generation of enhanced customer experience by partnering with OpenAI.
“For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change. There is a native AI experience coming that is multi-media, personalized and contextual,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Walmart.
The company stock was up 1.7% on Wednesday, marking a new high at $109.56 and a 20% year-to-date gain.
More Retail Stocks:
- American Eagle CEO addresses Sydney Sweeney ad outrage
- Costco just sweetened the deal for Executive members
- Amazon made a change to Prime shopping to take on Target, Walmart
This is not Walmart’s first use of AI; it has been successfully using it to enhance its product catalog and reduce fashion production times.
With this new deal, Walmart does not intend to replace human connection with machines; instead, “it’s about using AI to remove friction and make everyday moments easier, smarter and more delightful.”
This will simplify restocking essentials and meal planning. Walmart and Sam’s Club customers can chat and buy products directly through ChatGPT’s instant checkout feature.
DA Davidson’s analyst, Michael Baker, maintained his $117 price target and Buy rating on Walmart, noting that the retail giant will emerge as a winner among traditional retailers in the Agentic Commerce race, as reported by TheFly.
Who is Bunge Global?
Bunge Global, whose stock soared 12.9% on Wednesday, is a Swiss agribusiness and food company, headquartered in the U.S.
On Wednesday, it reported a change in segment and volume reporting to highlight the key drivers of the company’s results. In its 3Q 2025 reports, it will present the following four segments:
- Soybean Processing and Refining
- Softseed Processing and Refining
- Other Oilseeds Processing and Refining
- Grain Merchandising and Milling
The stock gain came after President Trump threatened to cut off imports of cooking oil from China, increasing interest in domestic producers of cooking oil, such as Bunge.
The company’s stock has seen a 19% gain year-to-date, and this segment change follows its merger with Viterra, a Canadian grain-handling business. Bunge estimated its fiscal year 2025 earnings per share outlook in the range of $7.30 to $7.60 for the combined company.
Analysts remain optimistic on AMD
Following the announcement that Oracle will deploy 50,000 AMD chips, Advanced Micro Devices’ stock surged 9.4%, a 97% year-to-date gain for the semiconductor manufacturer.
Oracle will be a launch partner for the first publicly available AI supercluster powered by AMD, with the deployment of 50,000 GPUs scheduled for Q3 2026.
This announcement, after the $100 billion OpenAI and AMD partnership, led Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson to raise the firm’s target price of AMD to $270 from $190. Bryson said AMD has reaffirmed certainty around future GPU demand, and these new agreements will increase future GPU revenues.

"Stocks dip as government shutdown continues, rare earths rally: What to watch this week","Read more: How the government shutdown affects your student loans, Social Security, and more

In the shutdown negotiations, healthcare is set to be the market sector with the most to gain or lose this time around. The primary battle in Congress keeping Democrats and Republicans from reaching a funding deal is over Affordable Care Act subsidies, set to expire at the end of the year — whether to spend more than $1 trillion to extend them, as the Democrats are seeking, or to let them expire, as Republicans are looking for.

For major healthcare providers like UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM), an end to the subsidies could mean a hole in their customer base if millions of Americans unenroll and many more choose not to utilize a plan at all. For providers like Centene (CNC), which focus on ACA plans, a subsidy sunset may signal a large incoming hit to their margins.

Proof that the market is watching carefully: When President Trump on Tuesday expressed encouragement for a deal on subsidies in a Truth Social post, healthcare stocks largely rallied.

Another potential impact of the shutdown is an influx of new job applications to the private sector. Applications started by federal workers were up 157% above their Jan. 1 levels as of Oct. 9 and up 132% above their level on the same date last year, according to data from Indeed. Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought has promised large-scale firings instead of the usual furlough-with-backpay situation that federal workers experience during a shutdown. Layoffs began in earnest late Friday.

But at the same time, LPL Financial strategists wrote in a recent note, private-sector businesses may be loath to hire at all, as access to federal business loans is curtailed.

'Rare earth Renaissance'

Toward the tail end of last week, shares in the normally staid and steady group of rare earth minerals companies shot upward as Beijing moved to clamp down on exports of the materials.

On Thursday morning, China's Ministry of Commerce announced a sweeping new set of export controls on a collection of rare-earth minerals critical for uses including electric vehicle batteries and data center cooling systems. The next day, President Trump posted to Truth Social, threatening a ""massive"" increase in tariffs levied against China.

MP Materials (MP), which operates the only large-scale rare earth mine in the US, spiked by more than 9% on the week, while mining company Trilogy Metals (TMQ) gained more than 185% due to the announcement of an investment by the Trump administration.

Other winners included USA Rare Earth (USAR), up more than 25% on the week, and international mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), up 3%.

""A rare earth Renaissance is underway in the West,"" Ryan Castilloux, the founder and managing director of rare earth research firm Adamas Intelligence, said at a recent conference focused on the minerals.

The share price performance is the knock-on effect of a geopolitical fight that has heated up between the US and China throughout the summer. As China, which mines much of the global share of rare earth minerals and controls more than 90% of the world's processing capability, has clamped down on exports of the materials out of the country, largely beginning in April, the Trump administration has looked for ways to pressure Beijing.

When the Department of Defense announced that it was taking a stake in MP Materials, part of the deal terms was a requirement for the company to cease exporting any rare earths to China. Government stakes in Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) and Trilogy Metals have signaled to Beijing that Trump is intent on moving the US off reliance on China.

"Weekly Market Wrap: Pepsi, Tilray and Nvidia","Tariffs are back in conversation, so are rare earths, and the market is bearish, as reflected in the Friday stock market losses.
- The S&P 500 declined 2.4% this week, despite positive earnings reports that failed to shield it from the impact of tariff threats.
- The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, despite achieving a 52-week intraday high, closed 3.6% lower on Friday and was down 2.5% for the week.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been performing well this month, due to market volatility, and was down 2.7% this week and 1.4% for the month.
- The small-cap Russell 2000 was hit the hardest, down 3.3% this week, reflecting a 3% loss just on trading Friday.
The threat of fresh tariffs looms large over the market. If you did not hear about it, President Donald Trump’s single post on Truth Social sent the market into a frenzy on Friday.
Indices that had been edging closer to reaching new records and maintaining several past Friday’s record highs, spiraled immediately after President Trump announced 100% additional tariffs on China.
In response to China’s announcement of imposing large-scale export controls on rare earths, effective November 1st, President Trump wrote in a social media post,
Further adding that effective November 1st, the U.S. will also “impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.”
These controls restrict free trade, including that of technical data, and impact trade relations, which sent the market toppling, worrying investors over fresh battles, the last of which heavily impacted the markets in April, around Liberation Day.
The week started on a positive note, with major indices reporting fresh highs, despite the ongoing government shutdown, which has been dragging on for two weeks.
As is common in an unstable market, investors often find refuge in tangible assets. In this case, the precious metal gold crossed a record high of $4000 and, aside from a 1% low one day, gained 3.2% this week.
The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the Fear Index, which measures market sentiment and risk, gauges market dynamics, was up 30% this week, signaling that after months of calm, the market may be gearing up for a slump.
Focusing on the stocks that kept the market afloat or were impacted by the tariff frenzy and market volatility, we include Pepsi, which rose 5.7% this week following a positive earnings report.
Tilray, a marijuana consumer packaged goods company, gained 6.2% this week despite an 18% loss on Friday. Meanwhile, Nvidia, which is leading the AI space and gaining ground because of it, was down 2.4% this week.
Why did Nvidia’s stock fall despite a lucrative deal?
Nvidia entered the $4.5 trillion club this past month, capitalized on several beneficial investments, including a strategic investment in semiconductor manufacturer Intel and a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.
More Nvidia:
- Goldman Sachs tweaks Nvidia’s stock price target with a twist
- Fund manager drops bombshell call on Nvidia stock
- Amazon’s new Alexa feature impacts Nvidia
More recently, the U.S. approved a billion-dollar deal for Nvidia chip exports to the UAE, which had been stalled for the past five months.
The company’s stock soared at the news, recording a fresh high on Friday before President Trump announced tariffs and export controls on tech firms; however, its stock was down 4.9% at the close on Friday.
But, amidst news of investigations and China’s customs crackdown on Nvidia processors, its stock declined 2.4% this week.
Also imminent is an inquiry into Nvidia’s relationship with a Singaporean company called Megaspeed, which, according to a report from the New York Times, has become a “preoccupation in Washington.”
Megaspeed is being investigated for its ties to Chinese tech firms, amid concerns that it is helping companies in China circumvent American export restrictions.
But notwithstanding the troubles, Nvidia has gained 36% year-to-date. Analysts predict that the AI bubble is not temporary, and considering Nvidia’s impact in leading other tech and AI stocks forward, it remains a crucial player in the AI race.
PepsiCo’s strong Q3 presence
On Thursday, PepsiCo released its Q3 2025 earnings report, and the stock surged 4%, making it a top performer among the S&P 500. It continued its high on Friday and closed 3.7% higher.
PepsiCo reported a 2.6% increase in total revenue to $23.94 billion. In its official statement, Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta noted, “Our reported net revenue growth accelerated and reflects the resilience of our international business, improved momentum with North America Beverages and the benefits of our portfolio reshaping actions.”
Laguarta further reflects on their future expectation,
As a result, Wells Fargo raised its price target on PepsiCo to $154 from $150, keeping an Equal Weight rating on shares.
PepsiCo also announced a change in authority, naming the former CFO of Walmart US as its new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective November 10, 2025.
Tilray goes on wild ride
Tilray shares recently gained momentum after President Donald Trump posted a video on Truth Social last month, advocating cannabis as a preventive treatment for the elderly.
On Thursday, it released its Q1 2026 earnings report, along with Delta Air Lines, PepsiCo, and Levi Strauss. With a reported revenue of $210 million, its stock soared 12% in pre-market trading, helping it reach a record high of $2.30.
“As we enter fiscal 2026, Tilray’s first quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our strategic vision and disciplined execution, said CEO Irwin Simon. Adding, “Our global platform positions Tilray Brands not just to participate in, but to lead, the evolution of the global cannabis, beverage, and wellness sectors.”
Simon appeared confident of the company’s success and in the U.S and UK changing landscape of cannabis use, to boost Tilray’s position.
However, on Friday, it closed 18% lower, raising questions over the stock’s volatility. Despite the decline, the company’s stock has gained 62% this month and has seen a 29% year-to-date increase.
According to a report from Grand View Research, the U.S. cannabis market was estimated at $38.5 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.5% from 2025 to 2030, primarily owing to the rising legalization of cannabis and increased acceptance for medical purposes.",TheStreet,2025-10-12T00:30:12Z,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/weekly-market-wrap-pepsi-tilray-and-nvidia,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:21.778391

Opinion: This is the dumbest stock market in history
Wisdom of crowds, indeed
The alleged “wisdom of crowds” is so stupid, so often that it seems crazy to suggest that today’s stock market — which is, after all, just “the crowd” chasing money — is the craziest on record. But a new research note from private-client fund manager St. James Investment Co. makes a case that’s hard to refute.
And that means all of us investors need to stress test our so-called risk tolerance sooner rather than later. Is our 401(k) or retirement portfolio balanced the way it should be? Do we have too much invested in stocks, and in riskier ones?

"Trading Day: Wall Street, gold cool as visibility dims","By Jamie McGeever

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY

Making sense of the forces driving global markets

By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist

Wall Street wobbled and gold had its biggest fall in two months on Thursday, backing off from record highs as investors pondered whether a deeper correction might be in the offing amid continued uncertainty caused by the U.S. government shutdown.

More on that below. In my column today I consider what is behind the increasingly loose fiscal policy in many developed economies despite sticky inflation and record public debt. Falling living standards for the younger generations could be a factor.

If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.

China expands rare earth restrictions, targets defence,semiconductor users 3. $600 trillion of wealth rests on productivity orinflation burst: Mike Dolan 4.

Today's Key Market Moves

* STOCKS: New highs for Japan's Nikkei and Germany's DAX,10-year high for China's Shanghai Composite. Wall Street falls -Nasdaq -0.1%, Russell 2000 -0.6%. * SHARES/SECTORS: All but one of the S&P 500's 11 sectors- consumer staples - end in the red. Materials, industrials downaround 1.5%. Biggest stock decliner is Dell, -5%. * FX: Dollar highest in over two months. Gains 1% or morevs Swedish and Norwegian crowns. Argentina's peso rises afterU.S. confirms $20 billion swap line. * BONDS: Treasury yields trade in very narrow 2-3 bpsrange, 30y auction is unremarkable. * COMMODITIES/METALS: Gaza ceasefire moves markets. Golddips below $4,000/oz, oil falls 1.5%. But silver hits new highabove $51/oz, LME copper breaks $11,000/ton, highest since Maylast year.

Today's Talking Points:

* Bubble sirens get louder

The stock market bubble warnings from on high are picking up. This week we have had the Bank of England, IMF and now JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon weigh in on the risk of a painful correction and the economic damage that could unleash.

Is it different this time? Perhaps - interest rates are falling, not rising; there's no household or business credit bubble; leverage is generally low. Yet the surge in prices, tech valuations, and market concentration is eye-watering. The AI frenzy is surely unsustainable, right?

* Private markets reel

The bankruptcy protection filing by U.S. auto parts firm First Brands - and mysterious disappearance of $2.3 billion - is intensifying speculation that all is not rosy in the private credit garden. Could this be where bubble risks lie, rather than public markets?

Shares in firms heavily involved in private markets like KKR, Carlyle Group and Blackstone are getting slammed as investors fret First Brands' murky finances are not an isolated case. ""The opaqueness is part of the process. That's a feature not a bug,"" investor Jim Chanos told the FT last week.

* U.S. earnings season kicks off

The Q3 earnings season kicks into gear next week with mega financials - Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Citi, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley etc - all reporting. The focus, however, will perhaps be on the tariff-affected consumer and retail sectors and, of course, Big Tech.

How does the big picture look? The consensus estimate according to LSEG is 8-9% earnings growth. But LPL Financial analysts reckon GDP growth of around 3%, AI capex booming, and a weaker dollar, mean another quarter of low-teens growth is likely. Health warning though - 70% of the consensus estimate is from the biggest six tech firms (Mag 7 minus Tesla).

The kids are not alright. Is global fiscal splurge the answer?

If you're wondering why there is so little desire anywhere in the developed world to tighten fiscal or monetary policy, take a look at a chart published this week by the International Monetary Fund. It is worth a thousand words.

In a preview of the Fund's upcoming World Economic Outlook, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva presented a chart taken from a paper by Harvard-based researchers showing that the likelihood of young Americans growing up to earn more than their parents has never been lower.

Barely half of Americans aged 30 are earning more than their parents, compared with more than 90% half a century ago, the study finds. It's a stark statistic that calls into question not only the ""American Dream"" but also a fundamental pillar of liberal capitalism, the idea that each generation will enjoy higher living standards than the last.

While the paper was published in 2017 and thus focused on ""Millennials"", it is safe to assume the subsequent ""Gen Z"" and ""Gen Alpha"" cohorts are not faring much better. They are coming of age in a post-pandemic world marked by polarized politics, inequality, unaffordable housing, the AI disruption, dwindling pensions, and rising retirement ages.

These threats reflect what Georgieva calls the ""deep undercurrents of marginalization, discontent, and hardship"" impacting young people around the world, not just in America.

Growing fear of this deep disillusion may help explain why policymakers across the developed world are seeking to juice their economies by simultaneously revving up their monetary and fiscal engines - even in the face of the AI capex boom, above-target inflation, ultra-loose financial conditions, deteriorating public debt dynamics and record-high prices in many financial markets.

'A PROPER BOND MARKET RIOT'

This massive dovish tilt in many advanced economies has accelerated in the past year.

In the United States, President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" - chock-full of tax breaks - will add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the budget deficit over the next decade. Trump has also floated the idea of using tariff revenues to send Americans checks of up to $2,000, and of course, the Federal Reserve has resumed cutting interest rates.

Germany has scrapped its ""debt brake"" and is preparing a fiscal splurge of up to 1 trillion euros, while reluctance to take tough budget decisions has plunged France into political chaos. And investors are betting heavily that Japan's likely new prime minister Sanae Takaichi will make an unambiguously dovish turn in Tokyo's fiscal and monetary policy stance.

""Politicians everywhere have fallen into a fiscal trap of their own making; increasingly hostile electorates will surely not tolerate the pain necessary to avoid government debt spiraling out of control,"" says Albert Edwards, strategist at Societe Generale and long-term market bear.

The surge in gold's price this year is the clearest sign that investors are concerned about creeping global ""fiscal dominance,"" when governments' tax and spending plans tie monetary policymakers' hands, Edwards says. Many analysts share his view that this will lead to more currency debasement and higher inflation.

Can anything halt this trend?

""The only way to break the 'Kicking the can down the road' philosophy is a proper bond market riot,"" Edwards says, adding that it won't be until inflation is 15% or higher that a figure like former Fed Chair Paul Volcker or UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will ""sort out the chaos.""

Inflation on that scale, and the draconian response to it, is not on the immediate or even middle-distance horizon, of course.

In the meantime, financial markets are booming, meaning the rise in paper wealth is outstripping economic and income growth, to the relative detriment of the young. Perhaps AI will spark a productivity boom to narrow that gap, but that remains to be seen. And even if it does, entry-level positions – young workers' first step toward wealth creation – will likely be the ones most at risk from AI disruption.

It's a safe bet that many of the policymakers gathering in Washington for the IMF/World Bank meetings next week will keep pressing the fiscal accelerator. Whether that will ultimately be good or bad news for the disillusioned young is another question.

Trading Day: A 'melt up' time out (except gold),"In this article:

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY

Making sense of the forces driving global markets

By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist

A burst of profit-taking and economic jitters knocked U.S. and world stocks off their record-high perches on Tuesday as investors digested the ongoing political gridlock in the U.S. and France, while gold futures reached the landmark $4,000 an ounce level.

More on that below. In my column today I look at the asymmetric risks in the Fed's easy policy stance. Chair Jerome Powell says rate cuts are needed to support the creaking labor market, but that may be questionable. What's less debatable is the whoosh they are giving to already booming asset prices.

If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.

1. Forget recession, world economy is being run 'hot': MikeDolan 2. White House says no shutdown-related layoffs yet, butwarns they could come 3. OpenAI declares 'huge focus' on enterprise growth witharray of partnerships 4. Private credit cash pivots from 'risky' West to emergingmarkets 5. Wall Street's trading shuffle bankrolls the casino

Today's Key Market Moves

* STOCKS: Wall Street indices down between 0.2% (Dow) and1.1% (Russell 2000). Japan's Nikkei ekes out new high. * SHARES/SECTORS: U.S. biggest sector movers are consumerdiscretionaries -1.4%, consumer staples +0.9%. AMD shares addanother 4%. * FX: Dollar hits 6-week high. Japan's yen extends slide -USD/JPY 152.00, EUR/JPY at new high of 177.00. Hungary's forintsinks 2%, bitcoin -3%. * BONDS: Japanese 30-year yield hits new record high3.345%. U.S. Treasury yields down 2-4 bps across the curve.3-year auction is well-received. * COMMODITIES: U.S. gold futures hit $4,000/oz for thefirst time.

Today's Talking Points:

* U.S. bank reserves below $3 trillion

U.S. bank reserves held at the Fed are below $3 trillion for the first time since January - down nearly $300 billion since late August - a clear sign that excess liquidity is being drained from the system.

There's nothing magical about the $3 trillion figure, and it is probably well above the unknowable level where officials reckon reserves are still ""ample"". But it brings into focus Fed QT and the question of how low can reserves go without sparking liquidity concerns. Fed Governor Christopher Waller has said $2.7 trillion might hypothetically be an ideal level. It's not far away.

* Bond blues

Sovereign debt markets around the world are under heavy pressure, particularly the long end of the curve, where yields have recently shot up to historic highs in many countries. And in the case of Japan, record highs.

There was some respite for U.S. Treasuries on Tuesday, but the backdrop remains challenging. Policymakers are running economies hot with monetary and fiscal easing, just as financial markets are booming and inflation is above target. Right now, investors are more inclined to sell any rip than buy any dip.

* Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years

Gold futures reached $4,000 an ounce on Tuesday, and the spot market price got to within $10 of that landmark level. Bullion has climbed 20% in just six weeks, and is up more than 50% this year.

The rally must run out of steam soon, right? Perhaps. But as talk of 'debasement' trades continues to percolate, and central banks continue buying, it's not clear what that catalyst is or when it appears.

Easy Fed risks pouring fuel on 'everything' rally

The Federal Reserve says its interest rate cuts are aimed at softening the impact of a looming labor market rupture. Unfortunately, cheaper money is unlikely to achieve that goal, but what it almost certainly will do is fuel the ""everything"" rally in financial assets.

The reasoning posited by Chair Jerome Powell and the bevy of doves on the Federal Open Market Committee for pre-emptive easing is sound enough. Job growth is evaporating, which risks triggering a spiral of surging unemployment, lower consumption, and slower growth or even recession.

The problem is the Fed's go-to tool in its armory - the federal funds policy rate - is a blunt one. This has always been true, but the risks in using it now are particularly asymmetric and increasingly skewed towards unwanted outcomes.

This is partly down to the imbalances that have taken root across corporate, economic and financial America. Consumption is driven by the richest households, who own most of a booming Wall Street, where profits, investment and market cap are dominated by a handful or two of megacompanies.

The Fed is easing monetary policy with U.S. financial conditions the loosest in over three years, credit spreads the tightest since 1998, inflation a percentage point above target, and GDP growth running at an annualized rate of around 3% or higher.

In financial markets, the ""everything"" rally is in full flow - Wall Street's big three indices, the Russell 2000 small-cap index, the tech sector, semiconductor stocks, gold, and bitcoin are all at record highs.

Powell did say late last month that equity prices were ""fairly highly valued"", perhaps echoing former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 1996 speech highlighting ""irrational exuberance"" in markets at that time. It's worth remembering, however, that the S&P 500 subsequently doubled and the Nasdaq quadrupled in value before peaking in March 2000.

There's no suggestion a similar boom - or bust - is on the cards. But because the wealth effect seems so prevalent, perhaps the Fed should be factoring financial market conditions into their decision-making more than they have in the past.

IT'S A 'LOW-HIRE, LOW-FIRE' LABOR MARKET

Yet that doesn't appear to be the case. The Fed has shifted its focus towards the employment side of its dual mandate, but it's not clear how fragile the labor market really is.

Much of the recent spike in jobless claims can be traced to one-off weather events in certain states and, more importantly, one of the main reasons job growth has slowed is the Trump administration's immigration and deportation policies.

Even though policymakers' concerns may be justified, labor dynamics today are different from years gone by. It is a ""low-hire, low-fire"" job market - job growth is clearly slowing, but labor supply is shrinking too.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last month revised down its January estimates of net immigration this year by 1.6 million, and lowered next year's forecast by almost 1 million.

This has helped slash the monthly breakeven rate of job growth needed to keep the unemployment rate steady to well below 50,000, according to St. Louis Fed estimates, from over 150,000 at the start of the year.

And it's worth remembering that the unemployment rate is still a historically low 4.3%. It's unclear whether rate cuts, even the additional 100 basis points futures markets expect by the end of next year, will encourage businesses to hire more workers in this environment.

As economists at BlackRock point out, that degree of easing is typically associated with a much starker weakening of the labor market, inflation, and growth, none of which looks certain or even likely at this juncture.

BlackRock economists' base case scenario is what appears to be playing out right now - resilient household incomes spurring a revival in consumer spending, and the wave of AI-related investment in tech equipment, software and data centers powering growth. Markets are reacting accordingly.

According to Chair Powell, the Fed's policy stance is ""modestly restrictive"", that is, close to neutral. On balance, further easing probably risks overheating Wall Street more than having a discernible positive effect on the labor market.

What could move markets tomorrow?

* New Zealand interest rate decision * Japan Tankan index (October) * Japan current account (August) * Germany industrial production (August) * Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill speaks * ECB President Christine Lagarde speaks * U.S. Treasury auctions $39 billion of 10-year notes * U.S. Federal Reserve minutes from September 16-17 meeting * U.S. Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak includeDallas Fed's Lorie Logan, Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkari,Chicago Fed's Austan Goolsbee, and Governor Michael Barr

"Weekly Market Wrap: Intel, Nvidia and Electronic Arts made major news","The market closed at another high on Friday, Oct. 3, fueled by heavy investments in artificial intelligence and despite ongoing government uncertainties.
- Reporting fresh highs, the S&P 500 closed the quarter 7% higher.
- The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was significantly up, reporting a 10.6% gain this quarter but a 0.3% loss at closing on Friday.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a modest 4.3% gain this quarter.
- The small-cap Russell 2000 closed at a record high on Friday and was up 10% this quarter.
The government shutdown entered its third day, delaying the release of the official nonfarm payroll report, a critical gauge for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. Private data signaled a cooling labor market, with slower hiring and reduced layoffs, reinforcing expectations of further rate cuts.
Despite the shutdown, markets remained resilient this week. Historical data suggests that such a shutdown rarely weighs on stocks, and optimism around AI-driven productivity continues to rise.
Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos referred to the AI boom as an “industrial bubble” at the 2025 Italian Tech Week, while explaining that the AI boom is real and will increase productivity for every company worldwide.
Bezos further explained that this was similar to the biotech bubble in the 1990s, which led to some life-changing drugs, and unlike the financial bubble of 2008, which triggered a banking crisis.
Tesla (TSLA) made headlines, with record EV deliveries reported in Q3 and as CEO Elon Musk’s post on X, which urged followers to cancel their Netflix (NFLX) subscriptions, stirred buzz.
Additionally, Alibaba (BABA) continued its gains, rallying on AI and Robinhood’s (HOOD) stock jumped 22% this week.
Gold continued to soar, setting new records, while Oil slipped 7.8% this week amid slow global demand and signs of rising OPEC+ supply.
Major Stock Movers
Nvidia tops the AI race
Nvidia (NVDA) , the GPU chipmaker, entered the $4.5 trillion club this week, with its stock up 5.3% over the same period.
More Nvidia:
- Analysts revamp Nvidia stock outlook on its investment in Intel
- Nvidia suffers a major blow from China
- Nvidia spending billions to spread its AI dominance
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald believe this has solidified Nvidia’s position as the de facto AI infrastructure company, quarterbacking the AI industry’s buildout, which is currently in its infancy, as reported at TheFly.
Despite its ascent, it faces a roadblock in its multi-billion-dollar deal with the UAE that was announced in May.
According to the agreement, Nvidia would send several hundred thousand AI chips in exchange for the UAE’s investment in the US. However, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, even after five months, the US government has not authorized the chips.
Electronic Arts to go private, stock soars
Known for its video games, such as FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield, the stock of digital game company Electronic Arts (EA) soared 3.8% this week and recorded a 19.4% gain for the month.
The stock moved sharply after a $55 billion take-private deal by Silver Lake, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
EA shareholders will receive $210 per share in cash, representing an approximately 25% premium over the company’s current trading levels. The transaction, expected to be finalized in 2027, should not face regulatory hurdles, analysts say.
Despite the known interest, analysts are downgrading it, citing low expectations for a bidding war.
Eric Handler, an analyst at Roth Capital, downgraded Electronic Arts to Neutral from Buy and raised the price target to $210, the acquisition price, from $185. The firm does not expect any regulatory problems.
TD Cowen also downgraded the firm to Hold from Buy with a $210 price target.
Analysts raise Intel’s price target
Intel (INTC) stock recorded a 3.8% gain this week and an astounding 49% increase this month.
The firm has been the center of several headline-making moves in the past month, and the stock’s resurgence is driven by government support and strategic partnerships.
Nvidia agreed to a $5 billion investment in Intel’s common stock. Intel will also manufacture custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia’s data center AI infrastructure.
Additionally, the U.S. government has a 9.9% equity stake in Intel, acquired via an $8.9 billion investment. The firm has also secured a $2 billion commitment from SoftBank to renew investor confidence.
Such strategic partnerships have boosted analysts’ confidence, with Deutsche Bank raising the firm’s price target to $30 from $23 and keeping a Hold rating. Analysts believe that Intel “continues to exist in a period of high investment” for its product roadmap and is on an “aggressive pursuit” to strengthen its balance sheet.
Some reports suggest that Intel is in early talks with its rival, AMD, to become a foundry for its chips; however, no official statement has been released.",TheStreet,2025-10-05T03:52:44Z,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/weekly-market-wrap-intel-nvidia-and-electronic-arts-made-the-most-news,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:24.659565
"U.S. stocks surge to record highs: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq hit all-time highs on AI momentum","Synopsis

U.S. stock market surged to record highs on Friday. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all hit all-time highs. Investors are riding strong momentum from AI-driven growth. Small-cap stocks also climbed, with the Russell 2000 jumping sharply. Even with a third-day government shutdown, Wall Street remains resilient. Traders are watching key movers like Johnson & Johnson and USA Rare Earth for potential gains.

U.S. stock market surged to record highs on Friday. The Dow rose 366 points to 46,238, the S&P 500 gained 0.4% to 6,823, and the Nasdaq added 0.1% to 16,215. The Russell 2000 jumped 1.4% to 2,492. Investors are riding strong AI-driven momentum despite a third-day government shutdown. All four benchmarks hit all-time highs. Traders are watching key movers like Johnson & Johnson and USA Rare Earth for potential gains.

The gains put the indexes on track for a positive week. The S&P 500 and Dow are up more than 1% week to date. The Nasdaq has risen nearly 2%, and the Russell 2000 is up 2.4%. Investors remain confident that the government shutdown, now in its third day, will be short-lived. Historically, shutdowns have not significantly affected market momentum.

The shutdown has paused economic reporting, delaying the Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls report for September. While this removes a key market-moving factor, it also limits Federal Reserve insight ahead of its October rate decision. Markets largely expect a 0.25% rate cut at the October 29 FOMC meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Concerns about the labor market persist. President Donald Trump has warned of potential massive federal layoffs, calling the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to cut federal agencies.

Live Events

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the funding lapse could hurt GDP growth and working Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed each day.

Private payroll data from ADP showed the largest job decline since March 2023, signaling a weakening labor market. Jennifer Timmerman, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said that soft private jobs data supports the case for another Fed rate cut.

Low yields on the 10-year Treasury, at 4.11%, have helped push the S&P 500 to a new all-time high.

Small-cap stocks continue to attract investors. The Russell 2000 rose 1.5% on Friday, putting it nearly 12% higher year-to-date. Strong performance among smaller companies reflects investor appetite for growth stocks even amid economic uncertainty.

The U.S. service sector is showing signs of slowing. The ISM services PMI for September came in at 50.0%, down from 52% in August. This marks the lowest level of production since early 2020.

Business activity and production fell to 49.9, employment remained contractionary at 47.2, and the prices index rose to 69.4. Order backlogs gained to 47.3, while new orders and inventories declined by more than five points. This is the first contraction in service sector production since May 2020.

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee expressed caution about cutting rates too quickly. Rising inflation and a weakening jobs market put the Fed in a difficult position as it balances its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.

Stock-specific movements were notable. USA Rare Earth rose 8.8% after its CEO said the company is in close talks with the White House. GameStop fell 2.7% following a filing announcing an asset sale.

Applied Materials dropped 2.2% after reporting that new U.S. export restrictions would hurt revenue.

Wells Fargo upgraded Johnson & Johnson to “buy” with a $212 price target, citing strong projected medicine sales and expansion of drug-making operations in the U.S.

Young college graduates are experiencing the brunt of the labor market slowdown. Data indicates that recent graduates are disproportionately affected by the weaker job market, highlighting challenges for early-career professionals despite overall stock market gains.

U.S. Stock Market Today – October 3, 2025

Stocks surged on Friday as major U.S. indexes hit record levels, despite the ongoing government shutdown.

Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 366 points, or 0.8%.

S&P 500 gained 0.4%.

Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1%.

Russell 2000 jumped 1.4%.

All four benchmarks reached all-time highs. The gains put the indexes on track for a positive week. The S&P 500 and Dow are up more than 1% week to date, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 2%, and the Russell 2000 jumped 2.4%.

What is driving the stock market rally today?

The market’s current surge is largely fueled by optimism in the technology sector. Companies developing artificial intelligence and innovative tech solutions are seeing strong investor interest. This trend is lifting the Nasdaq and influencing the S&P 500 and Dow Jones as well.

Investors are also hopeful about potential interest rate cuts. Lower rates could make borrowing cheaper, boosting business investments and consumer spending. This optimism is supporting a broad market rally, even amid political uncertainty.

Additionally, some market participants are viewing this rally as a buying opportunity. Long-term investors are confident in continued growth in AI, semiconductors, and tech-related industries. This confidence is helping to offset the negative headlines about the government shutdown.

Which sectors are leading the gains?

Technology remains the standout sector today. Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and software companies are seeing strong trading volumes. This reflects the market’s excitement over new innovations and partnerships.

The semiconductor sector is also performing well. Companies producing chips for AI, data centers, and electronics are benefiting from strong demand. Rising semiconductor stocks are contributing to broader market gains and investor optimism.

Other sectors, such as healthcare and consumer goods, are holding steady. These sectors may not be surging like tech, but they provide stability. This balance helps the market stay resilient despite political and economic uncertainties.

Government shutdown adds uncertainty but markets remain resilient

Friday marked the third day of the U.S. government shutdown. Investors remain optimistic it will be short-lived, limiting potential damage to the economy. Historically, shutdowns have had little effect on market momentum.

The shutdown has paused economic reporting. The Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls report for September was delayed. This removes a key market-moving factor but also limits Federal Reserve insight ahead of its October rate decision. Markets largely expect a 0.25% rate cut at the October 29 FOMC meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Despite the ongoing government shutdown, the market has remained surprisingly stable. Investors appear to be focusing on long-term growth prospects rather than short-term disruptions.

Private payroll data from ADP shows the largest job decline since March 2023, reinforcing a slowing labor market trend.

Jennifer Timmerman, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, noted: ""Soft private jobs data supports the case for another Fed rate cut. Low yields on the 10-year Treasury, at 4.11%, have boosted the S&P 500 to a new all-time high.""

Small-cap stocks shine

The Russell 2000 Index climbed 1.5% on Friday, pushing it nearly 12% higher year-to-date. Small-cap gains reflect strong investor appetite for growth stocks even amid economic uncertainty.

U.S. service sector shows slowdown

The ISM services PMI for September came in at 50.0%, down 2 points from August and below the expected 52%. This marks the lowest level of production since early 2020.

Business activity & production index: 49.9 (contraction)

Employment index: 47.2

Prices index: 69.4

Order backlogs: 47.3 (up 6.9 points)

New orders & inventories: fell over 5 points

This is the first contraction in service sector production since May 2020.

Fed cautious on rate cuts

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he is wary of cutting rates too quickly. Rising inflation and weakening jobs data put the Fed in a ""sticky spot"" balancing its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.

Key stock movers

USA Rare Earth: +8.8% after CEO said the company is in close talks with the White House.

GameStop: -2.7% amid asset sale filings.

Applied Materials: -2.2% due to new U.S. export restrictions.

As the government shutdown enters its second day, a lack of data may give investors little to hook into for Thursday. A fresh record close for the S&P 500 SPX on Wednesday points to investors willing to add that disruption to the list of things that aren’t bothering them.
That likely leaves plenty of room for discussion around the boom in AI and whether the companies pouring money into that technology are going strong or about to hit a wall.",MarketWatch,2025-10-02T13:41:00Z,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cracks-are-forming-in-the-ai-capex-boom-warns-morgan-stanley-what-to-buy-and-sell-a9f23771,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:24.660468
"Stock Market Today: Nike, Eli Lily surge; Robinhood slips","Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025
The government shutdown began at midnight on October 1, after Congress failed to reach a consensus in time to avert it. The stock market, though, remains optimistic, given the positive start for October.
Market index returns:
- The S&P 500 was up 0.34%, reaching a 52-week high during trading.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up slightly at 0.1%.
- The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.42%
- The Russell 2000 was up 0.4%.
Notably, the 10-year Treasury yield saw a 0.033% dip after the government shutdown. If the shutdown continues for an extended period, it may begin to impact the market. However, shutdowns have historically been short and haven’t produced significant sell-offs.
For now, the jobs data from the Department of Labor will be delayed. It had been expected on Friday morning.
Additionally, Vice President JD Vance stated in a press briefing today that layoffs can be expected if the shutdown continues.
Gold, which usually soars amid challenging economic times, reached a new all-time high on Wednesday, up 0.63%. J.P. Morgan already expects prices to rise toward $4,000/oz by the second quarter of 2026.
Nike was a top performer, gaining 6.4% after the release of its Q1 2026 earnings report, beating expectations. Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company, continued to rally on President Trump’s deal with Pfizer, which promises cheaper medicines for Americans. Its stock was up 8.2% today on hopes it will similarly ink an agreement.
Reddit, a popular online forum, suffered at the hands of ChatGPT, experiencing a 11.9% decline on Wednesday.

The company reported quarterly revenue of $11.7 billion, up 1% from last year, but it reported a 6% year-over-year decline in gross profit margin, down to $4.96 million from $5.94 billion.
The primary reason for the profit margin squeeze was attributed to higher tariffs in North America and lower average selling prices.
Yet Nike stock rose today, partly due to investor confidence in Nike’s rebound in North American, European, Middle Eastern, and African (EMEA) sales.
The North America region grew 5%:
- +11% increase in apparel
- +16% increase in equipment
EMEA revenue grew 1%:
- +11% in apparel
China reported a 10% loss.
Elliot Hill, President & CEO, Nike, Inc., acknowledged the challenges in an official statement,
Nike also recently announced a deal with Skims, a solutions-first clothing brand by Kim Kardashian.
Eli Lilly rallies on drug agreements
After President Donald Trump announced a first-of-a-kind deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to reduce drug prices across America, it boosted the stock prices of other companies in the sector.
Eli Lilly (LLY) emerged as a top gainer, with its stock up 7.9% today, following news that it is also negotiating with the Trump administration to become the second drugmaker to provide comparable drug prices to Americans.
The multi-billion-dollar company is primarily known for its diabetes and obesity medications, such as Mounjaro and Zepbound. Its stock price has increased 6.8% year-to-date.
Reddit is losing ground amidst AI concerns
Reddit (RDDT) , one of the most popular online forums, saw a 10.7% decrease in its stock today, slipping further away from its 52-week high of $282.95 that it reached in September 2025.
Promptwatch, which conducts regular Ai-driven research revealed that OpenAI’s ChatGPT only cited 2-4% of Reddit content for social media references.
Reddit still remains the most cited site, compared with LinkedIn, which is only 0.4%, and YouTube, which was at 0.2%.
However, this immediately raises questions about the forum’s credibility amidst concerns about reduced daily user traffic, affecting the firm’s stock.
A year ago, in 2024, Reddit struck a data-sharing deal valued at $60 million with Alphabet’s Google. Now, according to a Bloomberg report, Reddit is in early talks with Google for a second deal to integrate Google’s AI products more deeply with Reddit.
If the deal commences, it will encourage Reddit users to engage more actively on its platform, driving increased traffic and subsequent revenue.",TheStreet,2025-10-02T00:05:20Z,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stock-market-today-nike-eli-lily-surge-robinhood-slips,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:24.660877

"Weekly Market Wrap: Apple up, Electronic Arts soars, and Intel resurfaces","After a three-day losing streak, the market turned higher on Friday, yet still finished the week lower.
- Electronic Arts jumped on reports of $50 billion acquisition.
- Intel reacted positively to demands for increased domestic semiconductor manufacturing.
- The market digested the latest news impacting Fed interest rate cuts.
This week, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2% lower, while the small-cap stock index, the Russell 2000, even after closing strongly on Friday, was down 0.6% this week.
Intel gained 4.4% due to President Donald Trump’s focus on domestic semiconductor manufacturing, while unexpected sales growth and upgrades in iPhone 17 led Apple to gain 4.6% this week.
Electronic Arts, a video game company, emerged as a winner, up 11.7% after news of a $50 billion acquisition was released.
New Deals, New Tariffs: Market roundup
It was a busy market week. It started strong, accepting and reacting to the Fed quarter-rate cuts on Sept. 17. However, the market slowed after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Sept. 23, in which he expressed uncertainty over further rate cuts due to an unstable economy.

Worry over valuation resulted in weaker performance in tech stocks, but some gained momentum following new artificial intelligence spending agreements.
The Personal Capital Expenditure (PCE) report, released on Friday, measures core inflation by gauging changes in consumer prices. It showed an increase in the annual inflation rate to 2.7% from 2.6%.
That figure matched market expectations, giving respite and support to those expecting further rate cuts. However, in his speech earlier this week, Powell said the Fed would exercise caution before making new cuts.
In addition, Q2 U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised upward to 3.8% from 3.3% previously, signaling a stronger and growing economy. In Q1, GDP fell 0.6%.
This came alongside a series of new tariff announcements from President Donald Trump on his Truth Social page:
Most major international drug manufacturers already have operations in the US or are negotiating deals to expand. Thus, their stocks did not see significant fluctuations after the announcement.
Intel rises, interest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing soars
Intel (INTC) stock was up 4.4%, reaching a 52-week high on Friday, and gained 20% this week.
On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration is considering a new plan to introduce a 1:1 ratio to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing drastically.
This new rule will require companies to ensure they manufacture the same number of semiconductors as their customers import from overseas. If not, they will have to face tariffs.
Intel’s stock gained immediately after this news. Consequently, the stocks of other US-based chipmaking companies, such as Micron and Texas Instruments, were also positively impacted.
In August, the US administration bought a 10% stake in Intel and announced that tech companies could avoid 100% tariffs by increasing their domestic investments.
According to reports, Intel has sought Apple and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, TSMC’s assistance with manufacturing and investment. These negotiations began before the US administration’s stake in Intel was finalized.
Intel, once the biggest chipmaker, has struggled to secure investments and retain its hold in the market in recent years.
Electronic Arts rises on $50 billion acquisition
After news broke that Electronic Arts (EA) might go private after being acquired by a group of investors, its stock surged 14.8% on Friday, reaching a 52-week high.
The Wall Street Journal reported that private investment firms, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners, are in advanced talks to acquire Electronic Arts in a $50 billion deal.
If successful, this will be the largest leveraged buyout of all time. This means that a majority of the funding will come from borrowing.
The news pushed company stocks to a new high and renewed investor interest. A multi-billion-dollar company, known for popular video games like FIFA, The Sims, and Madden NFL, its share price is up 32% year-to-date.
Demand for the new iPhone increases
When Apple (AAPL) announced its latest iPhone 17 and Pro models on Sept. 9, its stock dropped ahead of the event. However, interest soon returned, and demand appeared strong when the new models became available.
Even after closing 0.6% lower on Friday, Apple stock gained 4% on the week, and analysts are bullish over its sales.
Bank of America analysts relate the success to the US carrier promotions.
Meanwhile, Evercore raised the firm’s price target to $290 from $260, keeping an Outperform rating.",TheStreet,2025-09-28T01:06:15Z,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/weekly-market-wrap-apple-up-electronic-arts-soars-and-intel-resurfaces,Market-Wide,2025-10-25 13:39:24.661315
