Apple may have to open its walled garden to outside app stores,"The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that both Google and Apple have a “strategic market status.” Basically, they have a monopoly over their respective mobile platforms.

As a result, Apple may soon be required to allow rival app stores on iPhones—a major shift for the smartphone industry. Between them, Apple and Google power nearly all UK mobile devices, according to the CMA:

“Around 90–100% of UK mobile devices run on Apple or Google’s mobile platforms.”

According to analyst data cited by the BBC, around 48.5% of British consumers use iPhones, with most of the rest on Android devices.

If enforced, this change will reshape the experience of most of the smartphone users in the UK, and we have heard similar noises coming from the EU.

Apple has pushed back, warning that EU-style regulation could limit access to new features. The company points to Apple Intelligence, which has been rolled out in other parts of the world but is not available in the EU—something Apple blames on heavy regulation.

For app developers, the move could have profound effects. Smaller software makers, often frustrated by Apple’s 15–30% commission on in-app purchases, might gain alternative distribution routes. Competing app stores might offer lower fees or more flexible rules, making the app ecosystem more diverse, and potentially more affordable for users.

Apple, however, argues that relaxing control could hurt users by weakening privacy standards and delaying feature updates.

Security and privacy

Allowing multiple app stores will undeniably reshape the iPhone’s security model. Apple’s current “closed system” approach minimizes risk by funneling all apps through its vetted App Store, where every submission goes through security reviews and malware screening. This walled approach has kept large-scale malware incidents on iPhones relatively rare compared to Android.

It remains to be seen whether competing app stores will hold the same standards or have the resources to enforce them. Users can expect more variability in safety practices, which could increase exposure to fraudulent or malware-infested software.

On the other hand, we may also see app stores that prioritize safety or cater to a more privacy-focused audience. So, it doesn’t have to be all bad—but Apple has a point when it warns about higher risk.

For most users, the safest approach will be to stick with Apple’s store or other trusted marketplaces, at least in the early days. Android’s history shows that third-party app stores often become hotspots for adware and phishing, so security education is key. Regulators and developers will need to work together to make the review process and data-handling practices transparent.

There is no set timeline for when or how the CMA will enforce these changes, or how far Apple will go to comply. The company could challenge the decision or introduce limited reforms. Either way, it’s a major step toward redefining how trust, privacy, and control are balanced in the mobile age.

"RI, Brazil agree to start RI-Mercosur CEPA negotiations soon: Prabowo","Mercosur is a South American trade bloc comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia.
""We agreed to move towards a comprehensive economic partnership agreement ... we received support from Brazil, which currently holds the Mercosur presidency,"" he said in a joint press conference with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, here on Thursday.
President Prabowo also noted that Indonesia and Brazil have forged strategic cooperation, including a defense cooperation agreement (DCA), which currently awaits ratification.
In addition, the two countries have also established economic and business cooperation, including those agreed by several institutions and business entities from Indonesia and Brazil on Thursday.
""We are two new economic powers that are consistently on the rise. We are two forces of the Global South. Thus, cooperation between Indonesia and Brazil has strategic significance, and we both view this relationship as very important,"" he said.
The President underscored that, based on his discussion with President Lula, both Indonesia and Brazil are determined to continuously enhance cooperation in various fields.
During their meeting at the Merdeka Palace on Thursday, both leaders witnessed the signing of eight memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between the two countries with a potential value of over US$5 billion.
Those MoUs include cooperation in science, technology, and innovation between the Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) and the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, and cooperation in statistics between Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.
President Lula's state visit to Jakarta is part of his Southeast Asia tour and is also a reciprocal visit, as President Prabowo previously visited Brasilia on July 9, 2025.

"Central Bank lowers policy rate 100 basis points, matching estimates","ANKARA

The Turkish Central Bank on Oct. 23 lowered its policy rate by 100 basis points, matching market forecasts.

The benchmark one-week repo rate was lowered from 40.5 percent to 39.5 percent.

The bank said the underlying trend of inflation increased in September, and while recent data showed that demand conditions were at disinflationary levels, they also pointed to a slowdown in the disinflation process.

""The risks posed by recent price developments, particularly in food, to the disinflation process through inflation expectations and pricing behavior have become more pronounced,"" the Central Bank said in a statement.

""The tight monetary policy stance, which will be maintained until price stability is achieved, will strengthen the disinflation process through demand, exchange rate and expectation channels,"" it said.

The bank added that it will guarantee the tightness needed by the projected disinflation path in accordance with the interim targets by determining the policy rate by considering realized and expected inflation as well as its underlying trend.

""The [Monetary Policy] Committee will make its policy decisions so as to create the monetary and financial conditions necessary to reach the 5 percent inflation target in the medium term,"" it said.

The committee also lowered the Central Bank overnight lending rate from 43.5 percent to 42.5 percent and the overnight borrowing rate from 39 percent to 38 percent.

Türkiye's annual inflation rate in September ticked up to 33.29 percent from 32.95 percent in August, above market expectations.

From May 2023 until last March, the bank raised the rate from 8.5 percent to 50 percent and then kept it constant until its Monetary Policy Committee meeting last December, when it lowered the rate 250 basis points to 47.5 percent.

The bank cut the benchmark rate at its December, January and March meetings from 50 percent to 42.5 percent. At its April meeting, in a surprise move, the bank raised the rate 350 basis points to 46 percent, and left it unchanged at the June meeting, before slashing it 300 basis points to 43 percent at the July meeting.

At its August meeting, the bank lowered the rate by 250 basis points to 40.5 percent. surpassing estimates.

EU considers punitive DUV machine export ban following China's latest round of rare earth export controls — ban would impact ASML’s biggest growth market,"A European think tank suggests retaliatory trade measures against China, and the trigger appears to be Beijing’s threat to restrict exports of rare earth materials. But the suggested counterstrike would hit closer to home by expanding controls on semiconductor tooling, with ASML's DUV machines in the direct line of sight.

According to a recent report by Bloomberg, a European think tank named the European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) has begun mapping out “trade options” should diplomacy fail, amid growing frustration over asymmetric pressure tactics from Beijing.

In other words, if China weaponizes rare earths, the EFCR has suggested responding by tightening controls over legacy chip tools still flowing to Chinese fabs. Such measures considered by the EFCR, (which has no formal attachment to the European Commission) would put ASML — the only company in the world that can supply EUV scanners and one of just three capable of building advanced DUV machines — in a difficult position.

25% of revenue weighed up

In Q3 2025, ASML generated €2.4 billion in sales from China, accounting for 42% of system sales revenue and just over 25% of total revenue. More than 90% of those Chinese orders were for DUV systems like the Twinscan NXT:2000i and NXT:1980Di platforms, both of which remain exportable under current Dutch rules.

Unlike ASML’s EUV tools, which are already banned for export to China, these immersion DUV machines are used to fabricate chips on older nodes, and are critical to everything from automotive MCUs to AI accelerators built on older logic.

While the current licensing regime already restricts EUV exports, the think tanks suggest that the same controls could eventually extend to advanced DUV systems. Those tools are not exempt by default — they’ve simply been licensed on a case-by-case basis, and that door could close if diplomatic talks with Beijing break down. Bloomberg's report states that the EFCR is actively exploring those options, mapping out escalation scenarios in parallel with attempts to de-escalate.

If the EFCR's consideration of a ban on DUV exports catches the ear of Dutch authorities who follow through, it could force ASML to walk away from a quarter of its revenue overnight. While ASML has told investors it expects 2026 sales to hold steady even with a decline in China-bound shipments, that guidance assumes a controlled taper, not a blanket ban, as explored by the think tank.

Additionally, ASML continues to fulfil DUV orders that were secured before licensing rules tightened, many of which came from Chinese foundries racing to build up capacity while they still can. If those orders are cancelled or blocked midstream, the company could be left with idle capacity or orphaned inventory that isn’t easily redirected.

It’s tempting to write off DUV as yesterday’s technology. EUV gets all the attention, especially as TSMC and Intel push toward 2nm and beyond. But for China’s domestic foundries — SMIC, HuaHong, Nexchip, and others — DUV is the workhorse platform. Even Huawei’s Kirin 9000S, fabricated at a nominal 7nm, was likely stitched together using multi-patterned DUV.

The problem is that while China has developed domestic alternatives for some fab gear, it still lacks a credible substitute for ASML’s DUV steppers. Canon and Nikon, the other two players in the DUV space, are either capacity-limited or unwilling to challenge Dutch export policy. That would leave Chinese fabs with few options, particularly for immersion lithography.

Deepening tech isolation

If such a ban, as considered by the ECFR, were to pass, it would deepen China’s tech isolation, but also accelerate the buildout of domestic alternatives. SMEE, China’s state-backed lithography firm, has already shipped early-generation tools and is working on immersion platforms.

Meanwhile, SMEE spinoff AMIES recently showcased its latest lithography equipment at an industry event in Shenzhen. Even if performance is years behind, China has shown a willingness to subsidize inefficient infrastructure for the sake of supply chain resilience.

For ASML, cutting off China means forfeiting a quarter of its revenue and potentially triggering retaliatory action against its installed base of thousands of tools currently running across Chinese fabs, which all depend on ASML parts and servicing.

If the think tank's exploration were to pass, a full ban would hurt China in the short term, but hand it a longer-term incentive to accelerate tooling independence. It would squeeze ASML’s financials just as demand from customers in the West begins to normalize. And it would force the Netherlands to pick sides in a trade war it didn’t start.

BDO shuns external equity investments,"Auditing firm BDO has recommended that its member firms refrain from accepting external equity investments.

This guidance comes amid a surge of interest from major buyout firms globally, who are looking to invest in the sector, reported Bloomberg.

According to the leading auditing firm, this decision represents a “strategic reset,” aimed at preserving its “sustainable future” and independence.

The firm’s strategy now prioritises closer integration among its global member firms and a more cohesive approach to market presence.

BDO Global CEO Pat Kramer said: “Choosing independence is a conscious decision made from a position of strength. This approach ensures that we remain in control of our destiny while continuing to build a future-proof organisation.

“This is just one part of the journey. Consolidation among member firms and aligning operations across borders will strengthen our global reach, enhance quality, and deliver greater value for our clients and our people worldwide.”

Meanwhile, the auditing firm has also announced a series of executive changes.

Trond-Morten Lindberg has been named the successor to Pat Kramer as Global CEO, with the transition to take place in November 2026.

Lindberg, currently the chief strategy and operations officer, has been working in tandem with Kramer to “shape BDO’s strategy and drive alignment”.

Kramer will remain involved over the next year, collaborating with Lindberg and the global leadership team to enhance the firm’s market position.

BDO’s extensive network spans more than 160 countries and territories, with a workforce of more than 92,000 professionals in 882 offices.

The leadership updates extend beyond the global CEO position. Tony Schiffmann is set to become the global chair in November 2025, following his tenure as chief executive partner of BDO Australia.

He will take over from Wayne Berson, who will be stepping down from the global board chair role.

David Garvey will step into the role of chief executive partner of BDO Australia.

For BDO USA, Matthew Becker has been confirmed as the incoming CEO, with his term beginning in July 2026 after Berson’s retirement.

The BDO Global Board will also see new membership, with Jens Freiberg from BDO Germany joining, replacing the retiring Holger Otte, who has served the firm for over four decades.",Internationalaccountingbulletin.com,2025-10-23T11:26:10Z,https://www.internationalaccountingbulletin.com/news/bdo-shuns-external-equity-leadership-changes/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:30:12.519862

Beiersdorf Downgrades FY Guidance as Skin Care Market Decelerates,"PARIS — Beiersdorf AG stock held steady Thursday hours after the German beauty giant downgraded its consumer business’ sales growth, due to the ongoing slowdown of the skin care market.

“We saw a further deceleration of the skin care market in the third quarter of 2025, especially in emerging markets, which is why we now expect an organic sales growth for our consumer business of around 2.5 percent for the full year,” Beiersdorf chief executive officer Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

The group had previously forecasted approximately 3 percent sales gains for the year.

At 1:15 p.m. CET, Beiersdorf stock was trading at 96.34, up 0.2 percent.

The maker of Nivea, La Prairie and Chantecaille products’ sales in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, were 2.35 billion euros, down 0.9 percent on a reported basis and up 1.7 percent in like-for-like terms.

In the first nine months of the year, Beiersdorf sales reached 7.54 billion euros, a 0.1 percent dip on a reported basis and 2 percent rise in like-for-like terms. Company gains were driven by Derma results.

Beiersdorf has sought to refuel its cash-cow Nivea’s growth in today’s challenging market.

“The biggest Nivea launch of all time with our breakthrough ingredient Epicelline shows very promising early results,” Warnery said. “By broadening our skin care focus and reinforcing deodorants as a strategic growth pillar, we are strengthening Nivea’s position for long-term success. Our strategy for Nivea remains on track.”

Jefferies analyst David Hayes spotlighted a step-up in Nivea growth in September — at plus 8 percent on innovation rollout — but wrote in a note that it “only highlights the core brand is struggling [July/August around minus 4.5 percent]. The strategic reset demands investors reconsider what now? That may take time.”",WWD,2025-10-23T11:25:26Z,http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/beiersdorf-downgrades-guidance-skin-care-market-decelerates-1238322024/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:30:14.734933

"India Inc revenue expands modestly, profitability dips over 0.50 pc in Q2: Report","Synopsis

In the July-September quarter, corporate revenue in India experienced a modest uptick of 5-6%. Yet, profit margins encountered stress, particularly for industries like automobiles and pharmaceuticals, unable to transfer their rising costs to consumers. On a brighter note, rural demand spurred sales of tractors and two-wheelers, while both the cement and telecom sectors reported encouraging revenue increases.

India Inc's revenue is likely to have grown by up to 6 per cent in the September quarter, a report said on Thursday.

However, the operating profit margins compressed by up to 0.60 per cent during the July-September period as compared to a year ago, the report by an arm of domestic rating agency Crisil said.

""Corporate revenue is expected to have grown a modest 5-6 per cent on-year in the July-September quarter, following underwhelming performance of the power, coal, information technology (IT) services and steel sectors,"" it said.

The agency, which analysed performance of 600 companies, said companies in the sectors posting slower growth account for a third of the overall revenue.

It added that sequentially, the revenue growth during July-September period will be one percentage point higher than the preceding June quarter.

Live Events

From a profitability perspective, it said companies struggled to fully pass on incremental costs in the automobile, pharmaceuticals and aluminium sectors, and the operating profit margin likely fell 0.50-1 per cent in Q2.

Continuing geopolitical uncertainties weighed on the IT services sector, with project deferrals likely limiting revenue growth to 1 per cent, while in the steel sector revenue is expected to have grown a moderate 4 per cent on-year despite having a volume growth of 9 per cent due to decline in steel prices.

The power sector's revenue likely grew a mere 1 per cent, affected by a surge in hydro-generation because of monsoon being 108 per cent of the long-period average and a 10 per cent rise in renewable energy generation, which led to reduced demand for coal generation.

As a result, the coal sector's revenue growth was likely flat, it said.

""The rationalisation of goods and services tax rates created anticipation of new stock with lower prices, causing a temporary disruption in segments such as passenger vehicles and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). As a result, retailers and distributors delayed FMCG purchases, while high inventory levels and sluggish retail sales affected demand for passenger vehicles in Q2,"" Crisil Intelligence's director Pushan Sharma said.

Sharma said the rural economy got a boost from a copious monsoon and farmer sentiment also improved after the government announcement of higher minimum support prices for kharif crops, which drove up sales of tractors and two-wheelers.

Revenue of tractor makers likely surged 36 per cent driven by a 31 per cent increase in volume, while two-wheeler revenue is expected to have grown 9 per cent led by a 6 per cent increase in volume, Sharma added.

The cement sector likely rebounded with 8 per cent revenue growth following a 6-7 per cent on-year increase in volume over a low base and pre-festival demand, it said, adding the pharmaceutical sector is expected to have grown 8 per cent on export demand and stable domestic market conditions.

Telecom services revenue likely grew 7 per cent in Q2 because of higher realisations on account of costlier subscription plans, even as subscriber growth was flat, it said.

Elaborating on its profitability compression expectations, the agency said the automobile sector's margins are expected to have contracted 1.50-2 per cent on-year owing to the continual rise in aluminium prices, which grew by 11 per cent.

Margins for the aluminium sector likely moderated 1-1.5 per cent on lower export realisations on account of lower regional premiums.

In the pharmaceutical sector, margins are expected to have contracted 1.5-2 per cent owing to pricing pressure on existing products, which faced higher competition in export markets compared with newly launched products.

Cement, steel and telecom services sectors are likely to have expanded profit margins during the quarter, the report said.

German Culture Minister Urges MFE’s Pier Silvio Berlusconi To “Keep Your Promises” On ProSiebenSat.1 Media & Says Streamer Deal Unveiled “Very Soon”,"Germany’s Minister for State and Culture and Media has urged MediaForEurope boss Pier Silvio Berlusconi to keep “promises” about ProSiebenSat.1 Media‘s future.

Wolfram Weimer made the direct address to Berlusconi at the Munich Media Days event yesterday after MFE replaced ProSieben CEO Bert Habets with MFE CFO Marco Giordani earlier this week. The minister said Bavaria’s Minister-President Markus Söder was “paying special attention” to the situation as a keen supporter of media independence.

Weimer and Berlusconi had discussions about the future of German broadcaster ProSieben after MFE gained 75.61% of voting shares last month, as the Italy-based media group formed Europe’s biggest broadcasting group through the deal.

ProSieben, which operates in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, now sits in a group also comprising Italy’s Mediaset and Spain’s Mediaset España, with a stake in Portugal’s Impresa also being sought. Germany’s government has a much more local eye on the situation, however.

“Dear Mr. Berlusconi, we had intense and ultimately positive discussions both at the Chancellery in Berlin and, in particular, here in Munich with our Minister President Söder,” said Weimer in a speech. “Perhaps, dear Mr. Berlusconi, you don’t know our Söder very well yet, but you should know that he is a real lion, and he pays special attention to strong media because he really fights for it.

“That’s why it’s good that you have promised us to really strengthen ProSieben’s Munich location. We will be keeping an eye on this. We are sure that you will keep your promises and want to see the Bavarian Media Authority and our lion happy. This is smart and good for ProSieben, but it is also important for Munich as a media location and for Germany as a whole.”

In a separate talk at the Munich Media Days, Söder welcomed the new bosses at ProSiebenSat.1, but warned against the lack of German investors.

“The truth is that ProSiebenSat.1 has not been as successful in recent years as it could have been,” he said. “In this respect, it’s like in football: There is a change of coaches from time to time, and we now have to make sure that the development is positive, because the location is a strong media location, and media includes traditional media, but also everything around it, because today we are not only in the traditional media sector, but also in AI and digitalization.“

Söder is demanding ProSieben remains headquartered in Bavaria, which is in the southeast of Germany and around 400 miles from the capital, Berlin.

German journalism unions have voiced concerns over the editorial direction of ProSieben under MFE, which led to Berlusconi providing assurances to senior government ministers that independence would remain. Berlusconi’s late father, Mediaset founder Silvio Berlusconi, was known for strong views on the editorial and political lines of his Italian networks.

Senior sources at ProSieben have told Deadline there has been no obvious interference in Germany to date, but Habets unexpected exit has led to more questions. The former CEO had been due to speak at the Munich Media Days, which is running this week.

ProSieben COO Markus Breitenecker and CFO Martin Mildner were also announced as exiting this week, as Giordani was sworn in as CEO of ProSieben. ProSieben chair Maria Kryiacou said said the new structure, which includes Bob Rajan coming in as interim CFO, “reflects the ambition to further accelerate the strategic transformation with a clear focus on excellence and a leading market position in entertainment.”

Streamers meetings

Elsewhere in Weimer’s speech, he said that several recent meetings with global streamers would “vey soon” result in an announcement around a “restructuring of the production landscape.” This would “give the struggling market a boost,” he added.

No details on the scope of shape of the talks were forthcoming, but it is known Germany’s production sector has long been seeking an agreement with streamers that better compensates producers, writers, directors and other creatives in film and TV.

Weimer and other members of Germany’s government have been working on plans to introduce investment obligations on streamers, as part of plans to boost the number of films and TV shows made in the country.

Some €250M ($290M) will be made available next year to encourage more filming, meaning that along with regional funds and other pots, around €310M will be on offer overall. This does not include production subsidies from federal states.

Weimer has previously said government intervention is needed due to the “imbalance” caused by global streamers.

For streamers, the issue of local investment is becoming more and more pressing, with most countries now working on some form of levy or quota that matches, at least in part, the content obligations placed on local broadcasters.",Deadline,2025-10-23T11:22:09Z,http://deadline.com/2025/10/german-culture-minister-mfe-promises-prosiebensat-1-1236595077/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:30:18.948174

The best and worst NFL offseasons in hindsight: Barnwell stacks all 32 teams in seven tiers,"July is too early to judge an NFL offseason. Seven weeks into the regular season? The perfect time.

I'm being a little facetious here, but with nearly two months of football in the books, we have a much better sense of how each NFL team's acquisitions have fared in their new digs. Some players haven't made it onto the field at all, while others have transformed their new franchises. Coaches have shifted team cultures into better places or no longer have working keycards. A lot has already happened, even if there's much more to come.

And so, I'm here today to sort each of the league's 32 teams and their offseason business into tiers. I suppose success is in the eye of the beholder, but the question I'm asking for each move a team made is this: If it could make the same move again, would it? Would it draft that player with the same pick it did in April? Would it spend the same amount of money to bring in a player? Would it hire that coach?

Naturally, I've tried to adjust this for the capital invested in a player. The expectations should be higher for a first-round pick than for a Day 3 selection. Free agents signed for $15 million per year should be starting; guys making $2 million are valuable if they're even solid rotational contributors. I don't want to punish the decision to sign or draft players who have suffered injuries, but if a player with a significant injury history (such as Marcus Davenport) is out injured again, it seems fair to be critical of that choice.

Subscribe: 'The Bill Barnwell Show'

Crucially, keep in mind that these tiered rankings are relative to the expectations I believe each team realistically could have had given what they spent this offseason. It's unrealistic to compare the Patriots to the Ravens, for example, when the Pats signed six new starters who make $8 million or more this year, while the Ravens didn't sign any. Instead, I'm judging the Patriots versus what would have been reasonable expectations for their spending, and the Ravens by the same token.

I've separated teams into seven tiers, starting with the best offseason of the bunch and working my way from exceeding expectations down to coming up meaningfully short, finishing with the worst offseason in the league. I'm not sure anyone should be surprised with where these tiers start, though. (Teams are listed alphabetically within each tier.)

ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN

CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND

JAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN

NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF

SEA | TB | TEN | WSH

The NFL's best offseason

Indianapolis Colts

Highlights: Signing QB Daniel Jones (one year, $14 million) and safety Cam Bynum (four years, $60 million), hiring DC Lou Anarumo, drafting first-round TE Tyler Warren

Disappointments: The draft picks after Warren

I'm not sure how any other team could receive more glowing reviews. The Colts signed Jones away from the Vikings with an opportunity to beat out Anthony Richardson Sr. for the starting job, and what he has done with that chance has exceeded any possible expectation. Jones leads the NFL in QBR (80.2) while also posting the league's highest success rate and its lowest sack rate. He has been a legitimate MVP candidate while making less than just about every other veteran starting QB in the league. If he keeps this up, Jones will be one of the best one-year acquisitions in league history.

Meanwhile, Anarumo has helped turn around a defense that couldn't tackle or cover last season, with his exotic pressures and variety of defensive looks creating turnover opportunities for the Colts on a weekly basis. Bynum has played a huge role in locking down the back end for Indy, while fellow veteran defensive back Charvarius Ward was off to a solid start before suffering a concussion during pregame warmups and hitting injured reserve.

Warren was my pick for Offensive Rookie of the Year after four weeks, and he continues to impress in one of the league's most entertaining and unique roles. He's 14th among all receivers in yards per route run. The rest of the draft class hasn't made much of an impact. Second-rounder JT Tuimoloau was a healthy scratch to start the season and has played just 62 defensive snaps. Third-round cornerback Justin Walley is out for the year after tearing an ACL in camp.

Way ahead of expectations

New England Patriots

Highlights: Signing the trio of DT Milton Williams (four years, $104 million), Edge Harold Landry III (three years, $43.5 million) and Edge K'Lavon Chaisson (one year, $3 million) in free agency; hiring HC Mike Vrabel and OC Josh McDaniels

Disappointments: Slow starts for RB TreVeyon Henderson (second-round pick) and WR Kyle Williams (third-round pick)

The Patriots spent more and made more significant changes than any other team in the NFL this offseason, so it's no surprise they're improved. Some of their moves are still sorting themselves out. Stefon Diggs played a huge role in the mood-shifting win over the Bills, but he's averaging just under 52 receiving yards across the rest of the season. First-round pick Will Campbell has had his rough patches, notably a difficult game against the Steelers, but he has also been a major upgrade on what was arguably the league's worst left tackle situation.

The best of New England's signings, even adjusting for cost, have come up front on the defensive line. Williams has been a force in the largest role of his career, ranking fifth among all tackles in pass rush win rate. He has come through when the Patriots needed, closing out the win over the Dolphins in Week 2 with a game-sealing sack of Tua Tagovailoa.

The edges have been just as impressive (and on contracts that are way less expensive). Landry has 5.5 sacks and 12 knockdowns in seven games. There aren't many ends who can say they've successfully chased down Josh Allen as the read defender. And while Chaisson was a major disappointment with the Jags, he's suddenly a valuable starting edge defender. Chaisson has 4.5 sacks and eight knockdowns, and he created pressures that produced an interception against the Dolphins and likely saved a touchdown against the Bills. His deal is a bargain for $3 million.

If there's anything the Patriots would hope to see, it's more out of their Day 2 picks on offense. Henderson has averaged 3.6 yards per carry and been a significant liability in pass protection, preventing the Patriots from expanding his role amid Rhamondre Stevenson's fumble issues and Antonio Gibson's season-ending knee injury. And Williams has just two catches and 20 receiving yards through seven games. Third-round guard Jared Wilson has been on the field but has also been New England's worst lineman so far, especially in pass protection.

New York Giants

Highlights: Drafting first-round Edge Abdul Carter and QB Jaxson Dart; drafting fourth-round RB Cam Skattebo

Disappointments: Signing S Jevon Holland (three years, $45.3 million), QB Russell Wilson (one year, $10.5 million) and OT James Hudson III (two years, $12 million)

The young guys have been the reason to watch the Giants. Dart and Skattebo have been two boosts of energy for Big Blue. Dart has quickly established himself as an entertaining improviser and scrambler. Skattebo's propensity for finding contact has made him a fan favorite, though he was run over in pass protection on the Dart pick that fueled a Broncos comeback last week. And Carter is one of the betting favorites to win Defensive Rookie of the Year.

The veterans? Not quite as much. Wilson had one swan song against the Cowboys before being benched; the Giants paid him $8.6 million for three starts and hope they won't have to make it to a fourth. Holland has had his ups and downs in coverage, while Hudson was essentially kicked out of the lineup after a sequence of four penalties in four plays against the Cowboys in Week 2. The swing tackle hasn't played an offensive snap since.

San Francisco 49ers

Highlights: Hiring DC Robert Saleh; drafting first-round DL Mykel Williams, second-round DT Alfred Collins and fifth-round S Marques Sigle; trading for Edge Bryce Huff, signing QB Mac Jones (two years, $8.4 million)

Disappointments: Extending QB Brock Purdy (five years, $265 million), signing WR Demarcus Robinson (two years, $8 million)

Well, the conversation is going to be out there, right? Jones hasn't been as good as Purdy, but in five starts filling in, Jones has gone 4-1 and posted a 55.2 QBR. Purdy is better, posting a 68.8 mark over 2022-24, but is the difference between the two worth more than $48 million per season? Would Kyle Shanahan and the Niners' front office make that same decision again? Maybe, but $48 million would pay the salaries of a bunch of starters for a team that has had so many other talented players get hurt this season.

The defense has managed to keep its head above water despite losing its two best players in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner. Saleh has done an excellent job coaxing solid or better performances out of the rookies on that side of the ball, with Collins helping the Niners win against the Rams by punching the ball out of L.A. running back Kyren Williams's hands at the goal line, saving a touchdown. Huff joined the ranks of the walking wounded by suffering a hamstring injury last week, but the Eagles castoff leads the team with 24 pressures and 10 quick pressures, an excellent return for a player the 49ers are paying only $7.7 million in 2025.

Seattle Seahawks

Highlights: Signing QB Sam Darnold (three years, $100.5 million), Edge DeMarcus Lawrence (three years, $32.5 million) and CB Derion Kendrick (one year, $1 million); trading QB Geno Smith; drafting first-round G Grey Zabel

Disappointments: Signing WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling (one year, $4 million)

John Schneider strikes again. After trading Russell Wilson and promoting Smith into the starting role at just the right time, the longtime Seahawks general manager moved on from Smith and signed Darnold to take over as the starting quarterback in Seattle. Darnold is coming off his worst start of the season, but he leads the league in yards per attempt (9.1) and is sixth in the NFL in QBR (73.2).

Lawrence has been a physical force on the edge for a deep and talented Seahawks front seven. The longtime Cowboys defender has three sacks and 22 hurries on 141 pass-rushing opportunities. Zabel was on my early Offensive Rookie of the Year ballot and has helped solidify the Seahawks' offensive line. One of the few disappointments was Valdes-Scantling, who was guaranteed $3 million over the offseason before failing to make the 53-man roster.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Highlights: Drafting first-round WR Emeka Egbuka, third-round CB Jacob Parrish and seventh-round WR Tez Johnson; signing Edge Haason Reddick (one year, $14 million)

Disappointments: Re-signing WR Chris Godwin Jr. (three years, $66 million)

The Bucs have been forced to dip into their reserves to battle injuries, so it has been good that their draft class has been up to the task. Egbuka seemed like a luxury pick when Tampa Bay took him in the first round, but the Ohio State star has been essential for Baker Mayfield. He's 11th among all wideouts in receiving yards per game (75.3). Parrish has been feisty in the slot on defense, and Johnson has racked up 161 receiving yards and two scores over the past three games after just about everybody else in front of him on the depth chart was injured.

GM Jason Licht didn't make too many false steps this offseason, but I wonder whether the Bucs would still want to bring Godwin back on this contract after a rough start to 2025. Godwin was always likely to miss time at the beginning of the season after dislocating his ankle in 2024, but he was out for the first three games, mustered 26 receiving yards in consecutive contests and has then been sidelined again for two straight because of pain in his fibula. Godwin is going to miss this week's game against the Saints and has no timeframe for a return.

Slightly above expectations

Arizona Cardinals

Highlights: Signing Edge Josh Sweat (four years, $76.4 million) and DT Calais Campbell (one year, $5.5 million); re-signing Edge Baron Browning (two years, $15 million)

Disappointments: Signing LB Akeem Davis-Gaither (two years, $10 million)

The Cardinals haven't been able to get much out of their top rookies because of injuries, as first-round pick DT Walter Nolen III has yet to debut because of a calf issue, while second-round CB Will Johnson missed two games because of a groin injury.

Their veteran signings have had more success. Sweat has five sacks and 21 pressures off the edge after joining from the Eagles, while Campbell makes plays on a weekly basis in the middle of his 18th pro campaign. Browning, making peanuts relative to other edge rushers, is second on the team with 19 pressures.

Davis-Gaither is one of the few veteran additions who might not have lived up to expectations, as the former Bengals linebacker has allowed a 111.6 passer rating in coverage for Jonathan Gannon's defense. He was also fined for a hip-drop tackle in the loss to the 49ers, though the play wasn't penalized on the field.

Atlanta Falcons

Highlights: Signing LB Divine Deablo (two years, $14 million), re-signing C Ryan Neuzil (two years, $9.5 million), drafting third-round S Xavier Watts

Disappointments: Signing DT Morgan Fox (two years, $5.5 million), drafting first-round Edge Jalon Walker

Most of Atlanta's work this offseason was rebuilding a perennially disappointing defense, and there have been some pleasant surprises. Deablo has become a very useful player in Raheem Morris' defense as a blitzer and green-dot rusher, often lining up directly over the center and creating problems for pass protection schemes with his timing and athletic traits. Watts and fourth-round pick Billy Bowman Jr. have been meaningful additions in the secondary, with Bowman arguably looking more impressive before a hamstring injury.

Some of the moves haven't been quite as impactful. Fox didn't make it to the Week 1 roster, with the Falcons guaranteeing $3 million to a player who never suited up for a regular-season snap with the organization. Morris has been very aggressive in rotating his defensive linemen, but Walker has just five pressures on 124 snaps after being selected with the 15th pick in April's draft. Fellow first-rounder James Pearce Jr. has twice as many pressures across 24 additional snaps, though he somehow has only four tackles through six games.

Carolina Panthers

Highlights: Trading WR Adam Thielen, signing RB Rico Dowdle (one year, $2.8 million), drafting fifth-round TE Mitchell Evans

Disappointments: Re-signing CB Mike Jackson (two years, $10.5 million)

The Panthers chose the right time to move on from Thielen, who had been productive in Carolina before being dealt to Minnesota just before the season. He has been lost in the shuffle there. While the Panthers won't see the fourth-round pick that forms the bulk of the return for Thielen until 2027, getting out from what was owed to a player who has 47 receiving yards in Minnesota is an easy victory.

Dowdle has been a revelation since moving into the starting lineup after Chuba Hubbard's injury, becoming one of a handful of players in NFL history to produce consecutive 200-yard scrimmage games. The former Cowboys back was averaging 3 yards per carry before the opportunity, so I'm not sure I would count on him playing like Jim Brown the rest of the way in a rotational role alongside Hubbard. But it's hard to argue that Carolina hasn't already gotten its $2.8 million worth out of the 27-year-old back.

Most of Carolina's biggest moves are either tracking to be right around expectation (drafting wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan) or have been impacted by unexpected injuries (signing defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton). Jackson was a pleasant surprise as a starter in 2024, and he hasn't been terrible this season, but most of the big plays against Carolina have come on throws against the former Seahawks cornerback. Overall, though, this has been a very reasonable offseason for the Panthers.

Cleveland Browns

Highlights: An impressive draft class, signing DT Maliek Collins (two years, $20 million)

Disappointments: Signing Edge Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (one year, $4.8 million)

This was a rebuilding year for the Browns as they begin the process of getting out from under the Deshaun Watson financial fiasco, so there weren't going to be many free agents coming in. Collins has been an essential part of one of the league's best defensive lines, with the former Cowboys D-tackle and third-year pro Isaiah McGuire both taking advantage of the double-teams typically sent toward star edge rusher Myles Garrett. Tryon-Shoyinka was expected to be part of that mix, but the Browns seemed to quickly lose interest in him, and he has played just 29 defensive snaps through seven games.

GM Andrew Berry needed to hit on his draft class to get the ball rolling back in the right direction for Cleveland, and everything seems to suggest that the Browns nailed 2025. First-round defensive tackle Mason Graham ranks 10th in pass rush win rate among defensive tackles, five spots behind Collins. Their second-rounders might be even more impactful. Running back Quinshon Judkins has 467 rushing yards and five scores in six games. Linebacker Carson Schwesinger was my pick for Defensive Rookie of the Year at the quarter-season mark. And tight end Harold Fannin Jr. has been able to translate his standout traits to the pro level.

I'm not sure the Browns landed a quarterback of the future in this class by drafting Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, but adding four players who look like they'll be above average or better starters in the NFL in one draft is always a victory.

Denver Broncos

Highlights: Extending Edge Nik Bonitto (four years, $106 million), re-signing LB Justin Strnad (one year, $2.9 million), signing RB J.K. Dobbins (one year, $2.1 million)

Disappointments: Signing TE Evan Engram (two years, $23 million) and LB Dre Greenlaw (three years, $31.5 million), drafting third-round DL Sai'vion Jones

How many players are bargains two months into their contract extensions? Bonitto got a deserved raise after breaking out as a Pro Bowler in his third season, but he has taken another leap forward. My pick as Defensive Player of the Year at the quarter-season mark, Bonitto now has eight sacks and 17 knockdowns through seven games and has also been called upon as a spy against mobile quarterbacks. He's doing that while making significantly less money than fellow DPOY candidates Myles Garrett and Micah Parsons, and while those two might get double-teamed more often, Bonitto has been more productive as a pass rusher than any other edge defender in the league -- and not by a small margin.

Sean Payton has been able to find the right role for Dobbins, who has been efficient and effective between the tackles. I can't say the same thing about Engram, whose inability to threaten teams vertically or physically has extended to Denver. He has 179 receiving yards in six games. Greenlaw has missed six games because of injuries and was suspended after arguing with an official at the end of his Broncos debut, while Jones has logged as many healthy scratches (six) as defensive snaps.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Highlights: Signing CB Jourdan Lewis (three years, $30 million), hiring DC Anthony Campanile

Disappointments: Trading up to draft WR/CB Travis Hunter

The Jaguars made a lot of aggressive moves this offseason, so many of them are still works in progress or somewhere between hits and misses. That includes new coach Liam Coen, who has overseen an improved running game but hasn't been able to wipe out a weekly stream of mental mistakes and procedural penalties. New offensive linemen Robert Hainsey and Patrick Mekari have been upgrades on the players who were there before them, but I'm not sure they're values at what they're being paid.

I'm still optimistic about Hunter's future after the two-way star had his best game as a pro in London last week, racking up 101 yards and a touchdown on 14 targets as a wide receiver. When the Jaguars traded two first-round picks to draft Hunter, though, the only way to justify that sort of move was to treat him as a generational prospect on both sides of the ball. He hasn't been that guy: Hunter has been mostly anonymous as a cornerback, allowing short completions in limited time while ranking 57th among wideouts in yards per route run.

Hunter is going to be a solid player, and there's still plenty of time for him to develop, but he has not consistently shown the sort of ceiling that led the Jags to value him like a quarterback of the future with the draft capital they sent to the Browns. The far better cornerback has been Lewis, the 30-year-old veteran signed away from the Cowboys. I'm never going to believe there were other teams really willing to pay Lewis anything close to what he received from the Jaguars, but you can't argue with the results. Lewis has been a Pro Bowl-caliber slot corner and a hit for new general manager James Gladstone.

Philadelphia Eagles

Highlights: Drafting first-round LB Jihaad Campbell and second-round S Andrew Mukuba

Disappointments: Promoting OC Kevin Patullo, extending RB Saquon Barkley (two years, $41.2 million), various moves at cornerback

This had to be a quiet offseason for the Eagles, who spent heavily to keep their core in 2024 and let a handful of veteran contributors leave for cap reasons this past spring. Philly would obviously love to have players such as Milton Williams and Josh Sweat in the fold, but that was never going to be realistic.

The Eagles can be excited about the play of their young contributors on defense, though. Campbell and Mukuba have stepped into the starting lineup and looked like they belonged from day one. They're both down-ballot Defensive Rookie of the Year candidates and much-needed additions for the Eagles given the team's cutbacks on that side of the ball.

Barkley's new deal looms as a choice Howie Roseman might not make if he had the chance to do it again. Giving their star back a new contract after the 2024 season seemed like a deserved reward for Barkley's MVP-caliber campaign, but he has fallen back to Earth this season, struggling to spike the big plays we saw from him on seemingly a weekly basis a year ago. If the Eagles hadn't touched Barkley's deal or merely given him a raise for the 2025 season, the 28-year-old would have had no guaranteed money remaining on his contract for 2026. Instead, the Eagles will owe Barkley $16.8 million next year and are already on the hook for $2.5 million of his $15.8 million in 2027.

I suspect Barkley will turn things around, but the Eagles were expecting much more than 3.3 yards per carry when they gave the reigning Offensive Player of the Year an improved deal this offseason.

Pittsburgh Steelers

Highlights: Signing QB Aaron Rodgers (one year, $13.7 million); trading for and extending WR DK Metcalf (four years, $132 million)

Disappointments: Trading for CB Jalen Ramsey and TE Jonnu Smith, signing CB Darius Slay (one year, $10 million), drafting third-round RB Kaleb Johnson

The Steelers have to feel good about their major additions on offense. Rodgers, signed as the last veteran quarterback left standing, is 19th in the NFL in QBR through seven weeks (55.0). He's not the Rodgers of old, and he has put the ball at risk a little more often than coach Mike Tomlin might like, but the future Hall of Famer has completed 68.6% of his passes. The contract matters here: He's making about half of what Justin Fields signed for in his deal with the Jets. And then on top of that, Metcalf is averaging 2.4 yards per route run, 13th in the league among wide receivers this season.

Other moves to add veterans haven't been as promising. Ramsey made a couple of key late plays in early-season wins, but it's clear defenses aren't afraid of throwing at him. He's allowing a 106.5 passer rating in coverage, while fellow veteran addition Slay is 13 points worse. Smith has been marginalized at times in an offense that has cycled through four tight ends, and he is on pace for 332 receiving yards in his reunion season with offensive coordinator Arthur Smith.

In a draft with so many promising running backs, Johnson has gotten off to a rough start after being selected in the third round. He has averaged just 2.6 yards per carry on 14 attempts, and after an early-season mistake on a kickoff, the Steelers took him off return duties. First-round pick Derrick Harmon has been very promising, but he missed the beginning of the year because of a knee injury.

Exactly average

Dallas Cowboys

Highlights: Trading for WR George Pickens; hiring HC Brian Schottenheimer; signing RB Javonte Williams (one year, $3 million) and Edge James Houston (one year, $1 million); extending TE Jake Ferguson (four years, $50 million)

Disappointments: Trading Edge Micah Parsons to the Packers; hiring DC Matt Eberflus; not re-signing RB Rico Dowdle; trading for LB Kenneth Murray Jr. and CB Kaiir Elam

A lot has happened here. It has been almost universally either a wild success or a dramatic failure, with very little in-between. All of that adds up to a roughly average offseason, although you could probably make a case in either direction.

Let's start with the positives: This has been one of the very best offenses in the NFL. The trade for Pickens has proved to be a bargain and essential while CeeDee Lamb was out because of his high ankle sprain; he is on pace for 1,474 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns. Dowdle has been excellent in Carolina, but Williams is playing the best football of his career in Dallas and leads all backs in rush yards over expectation. Schottenheimer was a punchline when the Cowboys hired him as their coach, but the Dallas offense has clicked, even while down multiple starting offensive linemen. The former Jets and Seahawks assistant deserves credit for getting Dak Prescott & Co. back to their best.

On the other hand, the Cowboys traded away Parsons and their defense completely and utterly collapsed. Dallas is 31st in EPA per play allowed and 30th in points allowed per possession. I'd put most of the blame here on owner and general manager Jerry Jones, but Eberflus has received criticism and might be the latest one-and-done coordinator in Big D. Moves for former first-round picks Murray and Elam haven't panned out; Elam has allowed a 133.4 passer rating in coverage, while Murray has struggled with his tackling and gap discipline.

Great offense, awful defense, average offseason, average team.

Kansas City Chiefs

Highlights: Extending Edge George Karlaftis (four years, $88 million), signing DT Jerry Tillery (one year, $1.7 million)

Disappointments: Signing CB Kristian Fulton (two years, $20 million)

This was a quiet offseason for the Chiefs, with their most notable moves coming along the offensive line. Those don't really fit in either of the highlight or disappointment categories. They miss Joe Thuney, of course, but moving on from the veteran guard created the financial space to extend Trey Smith, who became the highest-paid guard in football. First-round pick Josh Simmons had settled in at left tackle before leaving the team for personal reasons, and while Jaylon Moore looked like he was the most overpaid swing tackle in the league while he sat earlier this season, he has come in handy with Simmons unavailable.

Signing Karlaftis for half of what the league's best edge rushers are getting paid looks to be an inspired decision from GM Brett Veach. Karlaftis' 13 quick QB pressures are tied with Myles Garrett and others for the fifth most in the NFL, per Next Gen Stats, albeit almost always one-on-one against pass protectors.

Fulton, who has never played a full 16- or 17-game season as a pro, has been limited to 17 defensive snaps by injuries and hasn't played since Week 2.

Los Angeles Rams

Highlights: Signing WR Davante Adams (two years, $44 million) and DT Poona Ford (three years, $27.6 million)

Disappointments: Drafting second-round TE Terrance Ferguson, re-signing WR Tutu Atwell (one year, $10 million)

This wasn't a very active offseason for the Rams, and nothing has been particularly outlandish or ominously subpar. Adams is coming off a three-touchdown game against the Jaguars, but those touchdowns also came on a grand total of 35 yards on eight targets. He has six touchdowns in seven games (and would have more if Matthew Stafford hadn't missed him on consecutive snaps for a would-be touchdown against the Ravens), but he's also 25th in yards per route run. Adams has been just fine.

Atwell seems like he shouldn't belong on the disappointing side when you consider that he caught an 88-yard touchdown pass to beat the Colts, but that also came on a play in which the slot cornerback fell down. Even with a couple of big plays, Atwell is 54th in yards per route run while playing 38% of the offensive snaps, which isn't much for $10 million. And Ferguson has just two catches for 52 yards, though one of them was a 31-yard touchdown against the Jags last week.

Slightly below expectations

Buffalo Bills

Highlights: Signing Edge Joey Bosa (one year, $12.6 million), getting a new deal done with QB Josh Allen (six years, $330 million)

Disappointments: Signing DL Michael Hoecht (three years, $21 million) and Larry Ogunjobi (one year, $6.7 million) -- only for both to be suspended

Bills GM Brandon Beane is almost always going to build his teams around drafting, developing and retaining talent, and so most of the biggest moves the Bills made this offseason were about keeping their own. They ripped up Allen's old contract and gave him what is essentially a new deal with an average salary of $55 million per year, which should age well as the quarterback market rises in the years to come. James Cook III, Christian Benford and Greg Rousseau all signed reasonable extensions, too.

Adding defensive line depth for a team constantly tormented by Patrick Mahomes in the postseason was a must, and that has been very hit or miss. Bosa has been both healthy and productive, as his 22 pressures are tied for fourth in the league, per ESPN's charting data. Bosa might have been seen as a replacement for Von Miller in the famous player situational pass-rush role, but Bosa has played more than two-thirds of the defensive snaps -- very useful.

The other defensive line additions haven't yet played, owing to a bizarre bit of simultaneous discipline. The Bills knew when they signed Hoecht last spring that he was going to be suspended for six games for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy, while Ogunjobi found out about his identical suspension after agreeing to terms with Buffalo. The Bills likely ended up getting a discount on both players' deals and might have believed they could get by without them early in the season. But when DaQuan Jones was injured in warmups against the Falcons on Oct. 13, the Bills had to turn to rookie Deone Walker as an every-down player, which didn't go well.

First-round pick Maxwell Hairston has also yet to make his NFL debut after suffering a knee injury in camp, which has led to a surprising amount of Tre'Davious White at cornerback. The most promising member of the rookie class has likely been blocking tight end Jackson Hawes, who looks like a very useful part of the offense after being drafted in the fifth round.

Bills fans might have wanted something flashier at receiver, but Beane's sole addition there was Chargers wideout Joshua Palmer, who was averaging 39 receiving yards before leaving the loss to the Falcons because of an ankle injury. Palmer's three-year, $29 million deal to serve as essentially the Bills' third or fourth wideout seemed a little curious, but Beane has made a habit of filling out the depth chart with these sorts of moves. With a Stefon Diggs reunion not in the cards and Davante Adams preferring the West Coast, I'm not sure there was an impactful receiver Beane was in position to add.

Chicago Bears

Highlights: Hiring HC Ben Johnson, signing CB Nahshon Wright (one year, $1.1 million), drafting seventh-round RB Kyle Monangai

Disappointments: Signing C Drew Dalman (three years, $42 million), Edge Dayo Odeyingbo (three years, $48 million) and DT Grady Jarrett (three years, $42.8 million); drafting first-round TE Colston Loveland

Has Johnson lived up to expectations so far in Chicago? Realistic ones, perhaps. The hype surrounding the first-time head coach in some circles might have been unrealistic, and he struggled early with some game management mistakes. But Johnson has helped get the most out of Chicago's run game and created plenty of completable passes for quarterback Caleb Williams. Chicago's expected completion rate is a league-high 70.7%. (Its completion percentage over expectation, unfortunately, is a league-worst minus-9.5%.)

Dalman got off to a rough start with ill-timed penalties and some pass protection issues, while Loveland hasn't been the matchup mismatch the Bears were hoping to add, with the 10th overall pick producing just 78 receiving yards across his first five pro games. The much-needed additions the Bears made up front on defense haven't yet panned out, either. Odeyingbo's one sack came in the opener, while Jarrett was underwhelming before missing the past three games because of a knee injury.

Wright hasn't been great while being forced into a starting role at cornerback, but he did produce a valuable pick-six in the opener against the Vikings, and getting even vaguely competent play from a corner making $1.1 million is a win.

Detroit Lions

Highlights: Re-signing Edge Al-Quadin Muhammad (one year, $1.4 million), drafting second-round G Tate Ratledge

Disappointments: Drafting first-round DT Tyleik Williams, re-signing Edge Marcus Davenport (one year, $2.5 million)

The Lions didn't make many dramatic changes this offseason. Their big addition was cornerback D.J. Reed, who was off to a great start before suffering a hamstring injury and hitting injured reserve, which leaves him somewhere between these two poles. The acquire-in-bulk strategy across from Aidan Hutchinson on the defensive line has had mixed results, too; Muhammad has been a solid starting edge rusher, even if his five sacks and 10 knockdowns might overstate the 30-year-old's impact.

The oft-injured Davenport, on the other hand, lasted two games before returning to injured reserve for the third consecutive season. Williams has had a quiet start to his debut campaign, and the first-rounder saw his role in the rotation diminish after the return of Alim McNeill on Monday night against the Buccaneers. And while Ratledge has struggled with quick NFL defensive linemen at times, he has already become a valuable part of the interior for the Lions; his initial double-team and ability to seal off Tampa Bay linebacker Lavonte David at the second level sprung Jahmyr Gibbs on his 78-yard touchdown run against the Bucs earlier this week.

Green Bay Packers

Highlights: Trading for Edge Micah Parsons

Disappointments: Signing G Aaron Banks (four years, $77 million) and CB Nate Hobbs (four years, $48 million)

If you're surprised to see the Packers here, remember that the expectations for these moves should be very high. Parsons has been every bit as explosive and devastating as the Packers could have hoped, as the former Cowboys star is on pace for 15.5 sacks and 37 knockdowns, both of which would narrowly be career highs. It's not a stretch to suggest that Parsons was the difference between winning and losing in last week's 27-23 victory over the Cardinals, as the star pass rusher racked up three sacks, 11 quarterback pressures and a whopping eight quick pressures of Jacoby Brissett.

GM Brian Gutekunst's two key free agent signings, though, have been underwhelming. Banks has missed two and a half games because of various injuries, and his move displaced Elgton Jenkins to center, which hasn't been a positive for the veteran interior lineman. Hobbs, meanwhile, has allowed a 134.0 passer rating in coverage as the Packers have attempted to move a player who was at his best in the slot for the Raiders to the outside on a regular basis. It's possible that the veteran corner is still battling knee issues after having his meniscus repaired in August, but there's a real risk of the 26-year-old losing his starting role if he continues to play this way.

Los Angeles Chargers

Highlights: Signing DT Teair Tart (one year, $4.5 million), CB Benjamin St-Juste (one year, $2.5 million) and WR Keenan Allen (one year, $3 million)

Disappointments: Signing G Mekhi Becton (two years, $20 million)

So many of Joe Hortiz's biggest offseason decisions have been impacted by injuries, many of which were bizarre or unexpected. Najee Harris had never missed an NFL start before suffering an eye injury over the summer in a fireworks-related mishap and then tearing his Achilles in Week 3. First-round pick Omarion Hampton looked impressive before going down with an ankle issue. Left tackle Rashawn Slater suffered a ruptured patellar tendon after signing a massive extension, while fellow star tackle Joe Alt suffered a high ankle sprain after previously staying on the field throughout his career at Notre Dame and his first season with the Chargers.

Becton's injury history is more checkered, though, and he has missed time in 2025 because of an illness and a hand issue. Becton has also disappointed when in the lineup. The Chargers have had more luck with some of their low-cost additions. Allen is on pace for another 1,000-yard season in his return to the Chargers, and St-Juste has been very helpful in a limited role as a backup cornerback.

Minnesota Vikings

Highlights: Signing CB Isaiah Rodgers (two years, $11 million) and LB Eric Wilson (one year, $2.6 million)

Disappointments: Losing QB Daniel Jones in free agency; signing DT Jonathan Allen (three years, $51 million); trading for QB Sam Howell and WR Adam Thielen

Could the Vikings have seen Jones' spectacular breakout in Indianapolis coming? No. It's entirely possible they never had a realistic shot at signing Jones given the opportunity available with the Colts because he was going to be positioned as the likely backup behind J.J. McCarthy in Minnesota. Given McCarthy's inexperience, though, the Vikings didn't do enough to have a settled backup situation. Howell was acquired for two fifth-round picks and then traded with a sixth-rounder for future fifth- and seventh-round selections without taking a regular-season snap in Minnesota, leading the Vikings to turn to Carson Wentz once McCarthy was injured.

Vikings fans were excited about their reunion with Thielen before the season, but the 35-year-old wideout has been a nonfactor. Expected to make an impact while Jordan Addison was suspended, Thielen had two donuts across the first three games of the season, and he has just 47 receiving yards through six games, an underwhelming return for a player who cost the team a future fourth-round pick as part of a late-August trade.

GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah's annual offseason reload of defensive free agents has been a mixed bag. Allen and Javon Hargrave have been useful interior pass rushers at times, but the Minnesota run defense has been disappointing, with the Vikings ranking below average in EPA per play and success rate on designed rushes. Wilson has carved out a starting role and pushed former starter Ivan Pace Jr. to the bench against the Eagles. And while Rodgers had his worst game of the season against former teammate A.J. Brown, the 27-year-old cornerback has provided a great value for his modest contract, with his performance against the Bengals representing one of the most productive and impactful games by a CB in recent league history.

Washington Commanders

Highlights: Trading for OT Laremy Tunsil, drafting seventh-round RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt

Disappointments: Drafting first-round OT Josh Conerly Jr., re-signing LB Bobby Wagner (one year, $8 million)

After a fantastic 2024 campaign, this season could be considered a heat check for Commanders general manager Adam Peters. His shot might have clanked off the rim. It has been a tough year for the Commanders, who have seen many of the players they expected to build around in 2025 either show age-related decline too quickly or regress in their second season with the team.

The Washington O-line hasn't been great, but that generally hasn't been because of Tunsil, who has been above average in pass protection. Conerly, his counterpart on the right side, struggled badly early in the season and might have been a candidate to hit the bench. The first-round pick has allowed 5.5 sacks, which ranks second among NFL right tackles, per NFL Next Gen Stats.

Other veterans haven't lived up to expectations. The secondary as a whole has been a massive disappointment, with second-year corner Mike Sainristil taking a step backward and Marshon Lattimore giving up big plays on what seems like a weekly basis. In terms of players who moved this offseason, though, it has been tough to see the 35-year-old Wagner struggle to keep up in coverage, where he has allowed a 124.7 passer rating in coverage. The future Hall of Famer is still one of the league's soundest tacklers, but offenses have exploited his lack of range.

Way below expectations

Baltimore Ravens

Highlights: Drafting sixth-round K Tyler Loop

Disappointments: Drafting S Malaki Starks, LB Teddye Buchanan and Edge Mike Green; signing CB Jaire Alexander (one year, $4 million)

The Ravens didn't spend much in free agency, and so although they've gotten the occasional big catch from DeAndre Hopkins and regular snaps from defensive tackle John Jenkins, much of the impact they were hoping to get from offseason additions this season was always going to be through the draft.

Among the few signings, Alexander has been particularly painful. After 29 rough snaps in the opener, the Ravens sat him to rest his knee for three games. He came back against the Texans in Week 5, but although Alexander was active against the Rams in Week 6, the veteran didn't make it onto the field for a single snap.

The rookie class has had plenty of playing time given the injuries on the defensive side of the ball, but as I covered in my deep dive into the Ravens, the rookies have been disappointing. The lone exception might be Loop, who has gone 9-of-10 (including a 52-yarder) on field goals and 15-of-16 on extra point tries while also handling kickoffs for Baltimore.

Cincinnati Bengals

Highlights: Re-signing Edge Joseph Ossai (one year, $6.5 million), extending WR Ja'Marr Chase (four years, $161 million)

Disappointments: Signing DT T.J. Slaton Jr. (two years, $14.1 million), firing DC Lou Anarumo, drafting first-round Edge Shemar Stewart

The Bengals made a series of bets this offseason to try to spark their defense. Those moves haven't worked yet.

Faced with the possibility that many of their young defenders had failed to develop because of bad drafting, the organization chose to fire Anarumo in the hopes that a fresh voice in Al Golden would unlock those players' talent. It's a lot easier to replace the defensive coordinator than a half-dozen contributors on defense. However, Anarumo has been excellent in Indianapolis. The Bengals, meanwhile, are 29th in EPA per play on the defensive side of the ball.

They're 31st in EPA allowed against designed runs, which is what Slaton was signed to shore up this offseason after leading the league in run stop win rate for the Packers a year ago. Stewart, the team's first-round pick, was involved in a contract dispute for much of the offseason and has played just 88 snaps while missing three games. One of the few positives on defense has been Ossai, who has 19 pressures so far this season, which is good for 12th in the league.

Las Vegas Raiders

Highlights: Signing LB Devin White (one year, $1.2 million), extending Edge Maxx Crosby (three years, $106.5 million)

Disappointments: Signing G Alex Cappa (two years, $11 million) and LB Germaine Pratt (one year, $4.3 million); trading for and extending QB Geno Smith (two years, $75 million); hiring HC Pete Carroll and OC Chip Kelly; using a first-round pick on RB Ashton Jeanty

What can we say? I was optimistic about the arrivals of Carroll and Smith to solidify the two most important jobs within the organization, but the early returns have been disappointing. Smith has put the ball in danger too often and is in serious risk of being benched for Kenny Pickett with one or two more disappointing starts. It would be a surprise if he was back with the team in 2026, even given the fact that the Raiders owe him $18.5 million in guaranteed money next season.

Carroll hasn't been able to turn around the defense, either, though White has been a pleasant surprise at times for a player making close to the veteran minimum. Pratt lasted four games with the team before seemingly falling out with the organization and being released. Cappa was almost unplayable when filling in at guard. These aren't franchise-sinking moves, but when you're signing veterans to plug holes in your lineup or serve as depth guys and getting replacement-level play, you're burning money and incurring the opportunity cost of not landing on a promising young player at the beginning of his career.

When I wrote about rookie running backs earlier this month, I tried to make it clear that I don't pin much of Jeanty's slow start on him. At the same time, a team doesn't draft a running back with the sixth pick unless it thinks he can be a transcendent player, and Jeanty has mostly been unable to overcome the offensive dysfunction in Las Vegas. Taking a running back that high in what was regarded as the deepest RB class in recent memory was always a curious choice, and Vegas' other top-100 picks (wideout Jack Bech, cornerback Darien Porter and offensive linemen Caleb Rogers and Charles Grant) have yet to make an impact, too.

Miami Dolphins

Highlights: Re-signing DL Zach Sieler (three years, $66 million)

Disappointments: Failing to trade CB Jalen Ramsey until the summer, a disappointing draft class

There's not much here, as the largest guarantee the Dolphins handed out to a free agent this year was $7.3 million. That went to guard James Daniels, who inked a three-year, $24 million pact, and he played just one game before hitting injured reserve with an ankle injury. It has been that sort of season.

Extending Ramsey in 2024 was unnecessary and turned out to be a financial mess for the Dolphins. Left with a need to move a player on an exorbitant contract at a time of the year when most teams are done spending significant money, the Dolphins eventually landed on a Ramsey swap with the Steelers for Minkah Fitzpatrick. In a secondary stocked with replacement-level cornerbacks, Fitzpatrick has been a stable voice at safety, but he's not going to propel this defense forward singlehandedly.

The real concern has to be the draft class, one the Dolphins needed to smash to help get their roster going in the right direction again. First-round pick Kenneth Grant has publicly admitted that he's unhappy with the start to his pro career. Second-round guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a Week 1 starter at left guard, has been overwhelmed in pass protection; he has allowed three sacks and a 9.3% pressure rate, the latter figure ranking 24th among left guards with at least 100 pass-blocking reps this season. And safety Dante Trader Jr. couldn't make a tackle in the flat on Ladd McConkey, setting up McConkey's 44-yard gain and an eventual winning field goal for the Chargers in Week 6. Nothing has gone right for Miami.

New Orleans Saints

Highlights: Drafting third-round S Jonas Sanker

Disappointments: Signing WR Brandin Cooks (two years, $13 million) and CB Isaac Yiadom (three years, $9 million); trading for WR Devaughn Vele; drafting first-round OT Kelvin Banks Jr.

The Saints operate within their own universe, which is how a team with no hope of contending ends up trading a fourth-round pick for a 27-year-old wide receiver in Vele. He has four catches for 29 yards through six games, and although he was injured at one point in September, the former Broncos wideout has gone catchless while playing 33 snaps over the past two games.

GM Mickey Loomis' attempt to bring back the good old days by signing former Saints hasn't panned out. Cooks, playing ahead of Vele, is averaging 0.7 yards per route run. That's 56th out of the 60 wideouts who have run 150 or more routes this season. Yiadom allowed a 137.8 passer rating in coverage over four games before missing time with a hamstring injury.

Struggling veterans don't matter much in the big picture, but the young players who need to be part of the next great Saints team and their success in 2025 mean much more. And it has been a disappointing start for the latest in a series of first-round picks up front. Banks, the ninth pick in this year's draft, ranks second in quick pressures allowed (17) and quick quarterback pressure rate (6.5%) among left tackles with 150 pass-blocking snaps or more this season. The Saints are leaving him on an island at the fourth-highest rate in the league, which hasn't helped, but this has been a recurring issue. Loomis drafted Trevor Penning and Taliese Fuaga in the first round to be the Saints' left tackles of the future before moving them down the offensive line positional spectrum.

Second-round pick QB Tyler Shough hasn't played, and third-round DT Vernon Broughton suffered a season-ending hip injury in Week 2.

New York Jets

Highlights: Drafting first-round OT Armand Membou

Disappointments: Expensive signings of QB Justin Fields (two years, $40 million) and CB Brandon Stephens (three years, $36 million); hiring HC Aaron Glenn

New York's two most expensive signings haven't worked out. Fields was benched on Sunday after a dismal two-game run, and although Glenn hasn't picked a starter for Week 8, the fact that the Jets have considered going to veteran backup Tyrod Taylor (dealing with a knee injury) tells you what you need to know. Fields is making $20 million this year and has a $10 million guarantee for next year. Stephens, signed to play in Glenn's man-heavy scheme, has a 142.2 passer rating in coverage this season, the fifth-worst mark for any cornerback so far.

It's too early to draw long-term conclusions on Glenn, but the early results haven't been promising. The Jets are 0-7, and Glenn hasn't been able to turn their struggling defense around. The first-time head coach has struggled with game management, in part because he clearly hasn't trusted his quarterback.

Membou, the team's third top-50 pick along the line over the past three years, has been one of the few bright spots for Gang Green.

Tennessee Titans

Highlights: Signing LB Cody Barton (three years, $21 million), drafting fourth-round WR Elic Ayomanor

Disappointments: Signing OT Dan Moore Jr. (four years, $82 million) and WR Tyler Lockett (one year, $4 million); drafting first-round QB Cam Ward

Titans fans might also want to add bringing back coach Brian Callahan for a second season into the mix, given that he was fired after 23 games at the helm. Obviously, if the Titans knew they were going to make a change, they would have preferred to do it in the offseason. But I'm not sure there was a realistic push to fire Callahan after last season, before we got to see what his offense looked like with upgrades at QB and along the offensive line.

Unfortunately, those upgrades haven't panned out. Moore, the 2024 league leader in sacks allowed per NFL Next Gen Stats, looks like a major reach on that contract. JC Latham, second by that same stat, hasn't looked much better when healthy on the right side of the line. I'm sympathetic to Ward's predicament in an offense that wasn't working and an O-line that wasn't playing well, but he's also last in the NFL in QBR (23.9). There would be real hesitation about taking him with the first pick if the league was redrafting today, though I still believe we'll see better football from him in the second half.

Ayomanor has been one of the few bright spots on offense, although that's also on a sliding scale; he's averaging just under 12 yards per catch and has a catch rate below 49%. And Lockett's tenure with the Titans ended after 10 catches for 70 yards; his most notable moment in a Tennessee uniform will be recovering a fumbled interception return and scoring a touchdown to help fuel a comeback win over the Cardinals.

The NFL's worst offseason

Houston Texans

Highlights: Drafting fourth-round RB Woody Marks, trading for G Ed Ingram

Disappointments: Much of their rebuilt offensive line; hiring OC Nick Caley; signing OT Cam Robinson (one year, $12 million) and LB Nick Niemann (two years, $6 million); trading for S C.J. Gardner-Johnson and WR Christian Kirk

I'm not sure I've seen a team give up on so many meaningful additions so early in the season since the Al Davis days in Oakland. Texans general manager Nick Caserio gave Niemann $4 million guaranteed and then cut the special teamer in August. He traded for Gardner-Johnson, restructured his deal in September and then cut him after three games, leaving Houston on the hook for $8.3 million. Robinson was benched after one game and spent two games on special teams before being traded to the Browns, with the Texans paying $9.2 million for his brief stint.

In all, that's $21.5 million for players who were already off the roster by the end of September. You can applaud Caserio for recognizing that players weren't going to work out and treating the money the Texans spent over the summer as sunk costs, but that's a lot of cash committed to guys who simply weren't good enough to stay in the starting lineup for very long. Robinson wasn't good for the Jaguars or Vikings last season, and the Texans had all summer to look at Gardner-Johnson before they restructured his deal, locking his money in place.",ESPN,2025-10-23T11:20:43Z,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46683459/2025-nfl-offseason-tiers-32-teams-best-worst-signings-trades-draft-barnwell,Broad Market ETF,2025-10-24 19:30:34.028110

Most potential homebuyers expect mortgage rates to drop. That's why they're waiting,"watch now

The majority of would-be homebuyers expect mortgage rates to continue their recent decline, and it's one of the main reasons why they're waiting to make a purchase, according to the findings of a new CNBC Housing Market Survey.

Rates have been creeping down over the last few months and are hovering around the lowest level in a year, with the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan now sitting at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. But nearly three-quarters of real estate agents surveyed by CNBC said most of their buyers think rates will come down further.

""My biggest challenge is when buyers hear predictions of future rate decreases, which in turn have buyers sit on the sidelines and wait to see how low they will go instead of getting out there and buying now,"" said Maureen States, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh.

The CNBC Housing Market Survey is a national inquiry of real estate agents selected randomly across the United States. Responses were collected between Sept. 22 and Sept. 30. This quarter, 54 agents shared what they're seeing in their market.

Most agents said they consider the current conditions to favor buyers over sellers, but they still listed affordability as the No. 1 reason why buyers are delaying their purchases.

Despite optimism that mortgage rates will continue to fall, agents said rates are still buyers' top concern. That was followed by uncertainty in the economy and then just overall affordability.

That sentiment appears at least somewhat divorced from reality, however: 44% of agents reported prices are decreasing in their areas, and just 20% said they are rising.

""Sellers are still pricing for a seller's market, and buyers are willing to wait for prices and rates to drop. It is a bit of a standoff, and folks are only moving if they absolutely must,"" said Katie Kosnar, an agent in North Carolina serving Raleigh and Durham. ""Right-sizing used to be a driving factor, but most sellers I've encountered will be paying a higher mortgage for a smaller house and just aren't willing to make that move.""

As a result, buyers are using interest rate buydowns or turning to adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower interest rates, in order to offset price pressures.

Roughly 40% of survey respondents said their buyers are borrowing money from family or friends in order to afford a home. Buyers are also compromising on home size, location or features in order to bring the price down, agents said.

The vast majority of agents in CNBC's survey said they expect home sales to either improve slightly or stay about the same in the next quarter, and about 17% expected sales to drop. Of course this varies by location, with some of the markets that heated up the most during the pandemic seeing the steepest declines, and other more affordable markets seeing bigger gains.

As for sellers, agents reported the biggest concern among that group is how long it will take to find a buyer. Some are concerned they're pricing their home too low, and sellers, too, are watching mortgage rates closely, agents said.

About 89% of agents who took CNBC's survey reported having at least one seller reduce their asking price, and nearly a third said more than half their sellers dropped prices.

Roughly 40% of agents said they had at least one seller delist their home, hoping to get a better price later.

Home prices continued to rise on an annual basis through August, according to several other national indexes, but the price gains are shrinking. Prices are gaining most in the Northeast and Midwest and weakening most in the South and West.

The supply of homes for sale in September was higher than it was a year ago, as were new listings after a particularly slow August, according to Zillow.

New listings usually drop from August to September, and while that was true this year — with new listings down 2% month to month — it was a smaller decline than the average 9% monthly tumble seen over the past seven years, also according to Zillow.

Inventory has made solid gains over the past year, but it is still historically tight, especially for more affordable properties.

""For buyers, low inventory and mortgage rates, from an affordability standpoint, are still a challenge,"" said Holly David, an agent in Richmond, Virginia. ""For sellers who are locked in to a 3% [mortgage] rate, even though they may have a housing want or need, they may not be willing or able to make a move.""",CNBC,2025-10-23T11:20:01Z,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/housing-market-survey-buyers-expect-mortgage-rates-to-drop.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:30:51.711935
"Another French museum robbery sees 2,000 gold and silver coins stolen","Another French museum robbery sees 2,000 gold and silver coins stolen

1 day ago

Tom McArthur

Around 2,000 gold and silver coins worth around €90,000 (£78,000; $104,000) were stolen during a raid at another French museum - just hours after the audacious theft of some of the French crown jewels at the Louvre in Paris.

The incident happened at a museum dedicated to French philosopher Denis Diderot in Landres, north-eastern France on Sunday night.

When the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment) opened on Tuesday, workers noticed a smashed display case and raised the alarm, officials said. The coins were selected with ""great expertise"", a statement to French media from the local authority said.

It is the latest in a recent string of heists at cultural institutions across France.

The stolen coins date from between 1790 and 1840 and are part of the city's private collection, after being discovered in 2011 during renovation work at the building that now houses the museum, according to local media.

Last month, criminals broke into Paris's Natural History Museum, making off with six gold nuggets worth around €1.5m.

A Chinese national was arrested in Barcelona in connection with this raid while trying to dispose of some melted down gold, according to prosecutors. She was charged earlier this month and is being held in pre-trial detention.

Also in September, thieves stole two Chinese porcelain dishes and a vase with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m from the national porcelain museum in the central city of Limoges. The items are still missing and no arrests have been made.

""They're unsaleable on the art market. The pieces are too easily traceable anyway because they're so well listed,"" a ceramics expert told Le Parisien newspaper at the time.

The heist that has made headlines across the globe was the brazen daylight robbery of €88m worth of historic jewellery from the Louvre museum in Paris.

A gang disguised as workers used power-tools and a mechanical ladder to gain access to the first-floor Gallery of Apollo in the world's most visited museum shortly after it opened on Sunday.

The loot included a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.

Art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC museums across Europe could see a flurry of copycat raids in the coming months.

If someone can target the Louvre and escape with the French crown jewels, local thieves may think ""let's try our nearest museum"", he said.

Security is clearly a problem for many cultural institutions, he said, before adding that compared to a heavily protected jewellery store, a museum with lax security and unarmed guards is a ripe target for robbers.

Louvre Museum

Louvre Museum

The Louvre heist - as well as the other incidents - have raised concerns in France around the lax security at institutions that house some of its most prized treasures.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the heist, the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars told French senators on Wednesday that CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and ""aging"".

The only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where the theives broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to the gallery housing the jewels, she said.

""We failed these jewels,"" des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from ""brutal criminals - not even the Louvre"".

A preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.

Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had ""failed"", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a ""terrible image"".

In the case of the gold stolen from the French Natural History Museum, the building's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.",BBC News,2025-10-23T11:18:58Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvzxnzjzzo?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:30:52.824328

BOE’s Dhingra Says Tariffs Will Hit Growth and Reduce Inflation,"Article content

(Bloomberg) — Bank of England rate-setter Swati Dhingra said US tariffs will drive down growth and inflation, as the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war becomes a key dividing line between hawks and doves on Threadneedle Street.

Dhingra said the fragmentation of global trade is likely to ease price pressures even though data is yet to show any major rerouting of goods necessary to lower UK inflation.

Bank of England Doves Focus on Trump Effect That Hasn't Yet Hit Back to video

Article content

“I would expect orderly fragmentation with some reduction in international diversification – this means lower overall growth – and some downward pressure on prices in the medium term,” she said during a speech at a Central Bank of Ireland event. “In my view, the primary transmission channel of tariffs to the UK in 2025 come through weaker demand, as tariffs act as a drag on global growth.”

Article content

Article content

The comments from the Monetary Policy Committee’s trade expert revealed differences in opinion over how US tariffs will influence prices at a crucial moment as the panel considers whether to slow the pace of interest-rate cuts.

Article content

While doves Dhingra and Alan Taylor have argued that trade ruptures will curb inflation — currently almost double the BOE’s 2% target — others are more skeptical. Catherine Mann, a hawk, has raised doubts that businesses will pass on any lower prices if goods once destined for the US arrive in the UK at a discount.

Article content

The panel is facing crunch meetings at the BOE in November and December with the committee split over whether they can carry on lowering rates in the face of high inflation. Data on Wednesday showing inflation in September coming in lower than expected at 3.8% saw traders rush to bet on an easing in December.

Article content

Governor Andrew Bailey is seen as a key swing voter, and last week said the effect of US tariffs was still “very ambiguous.”

Article content

So far, there is little evidence of cheap goods once destined for the US being diverted to the UK. The price of imported fuel and raw materials — around a quarter of all British producer input costs — rose 0.3% in the year through September, with sterling steady against the currencies of Britain’s major trading partners over the period, official figures show.

Article content

Article content

Still, trade relations are yet to settle since Trump’s return to the White House, with China’s restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals the latest source of tensions.

Article content

Dhingra has been arguing for more rapid interest-rate cuts despite the rise in inflation, with doves on the committee also pointing to a weak labor market and tepid economy.

Article content

On Thursday, she warned the central bank’s tools are not “well-suited” to tackle recent price increases in energy and food that have fueled concerns over inflation. She said this could even be counterproductive by curbing investment that would help supply.

Article content

Dhingra said that the UK will struggle to absorb the series of shocks that have hit the economy in the past decade without increases to productivity.

Article content

“Even the price impacts of most de-integration are uncertain in their directionality, magnitude, and dynamics,” she said. “Therefore, the appropriate monetary policy response cannot be treated as a forgone conclusion.”

Article content

Brexit

Article content

Dhingra also became the latest official to warn of the blow dealt to the economy from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Last week Bailey warned that Brexit will drag on UK growth for the “foreseeable future.”

Article content

She said UK households and businesses are yet to see the economic benefits from Brexit promised by its supporters.

Article content

“Nearly a decade after the referendum vote, an emerging body of evidence suggests that Brexit has been a contributing factor to stagnant investment and productivity, as well as a drag on the UK’s trade performance,” she said. “From the standpoint of 2025, it’s hard to see that British households and businesses have reaped the putative economic benefits of leaving the EU.”

Trump considering China export ban on items made with or containing U.S. software — sweeping restriction to hit hard in response to Beijing’s rare earth embargo in major trade war escalation,"The White House is considering banning exports to China of all items that were made with or contain U.S.-made software in response to China’s announcement of rare earth export controls. According to Reuters, this isn’t the only plan the Trump administration is considering, but if implemented, it would follow through on the president’s threat of a 100% tariff and a ban on critical software as a response to Beijing’s perceived escalation. Although there is no final decision yet on whether Washington will push through with this comprehensive ban, it could heighten the ongoing trade war between the two rivals, especially as almost everything — from consumer devices to industrial equipment — is made with or contains American software.

“I will confirm that everything is on the table,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement to reporters. “If these export controls — whether it’s software, engines, or other things — happen, it will likely be in coordination with our G7 allies.” However, other government officials favor a less drastic approach, especially as implementing a complete software ban would be incredibly difficult. Former trade official Emily Kilcrease said that such a move could also lead to unintended consequences for U.S. industry. “You would hope they are only putting threats on the table that they would carry out and stick with,” Kilcrease said to Reuters.

The U.S. has previously implemented an EDA software ban on China, hitting several Chinese tech companies like Xiaomi and Lenovo hard, as they can no longer design chips for manufacturing at external fabs like TSMC. The White House lifted the restriction about a month later in return for rare earth concessions, so it's likely trying the same playbook again, but with expanded coverage.

Instead of just focusing on chip-making software, a comprehensive software ban could essentially grind global trade with China to a halt. After all, it not only covers machinery and industrial equipment, but it also includes popular consumer-facing operating systems, including Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

China is slowly releasing its own homegrown software, like the Huawei-backed UBIOS standard, Huawei’s own HarmonyOS, which started on mobile phones and is now being deployed on its laptops, and the open source openKylin OS. However, U.S.-made operating systems like Windows and Android still dominate the market in the country. So, if President Donald Trump pushes through with a total software ban, China will be left scrambling to find a replacement for both general-use and specialized software, putting it on the back foot in the short term.

However, doing so will also accelerate China’s own homegrown software development. While Beijing already recognizes the disadvantage of relying on technological imports, the easy availability of foreign tech makes local advancements slower and often requires state intervention.

If Chinese tech companies lose easy access to Western technologies and products made using them, they would have no choice but to make their own to survive. And while the U.S. would still have global dominance in the meantime, there is no short supply of talent in China, and they could eventually create their own standard in the future that could challenge and even unseat Washington as the world's technological leader.",Tom's Hardware UK,2025-10-23T11:17:24Z,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-considering-china-export-ban-on-items-made-with-or-containing-u-s-software-sweeping-restriction-to-hit-hard-in-response-to-beijings-rare-earth-embargo-in-major-trade-war-escalation,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:31:11.868707

Dunnes Stores set to close three grocery shops,"Dunnes Stores is set to close three of its grocery shops by the end of this month.

It is understood the first of the three stores, in Cornelscourt Village in south Dublin, will close tomorrow.

This is a small grocery outlet located a few hundred metres from the larger Dunnes Stores supermarket in Cornelscourt Shopping Centre.

Then next Friday, 31 October, two more stores are set to shut.

This includes one of the two Dunnes Stores located in the Ilac Centre (48-50 Henry St) in Dublin city centre, and the outlet on West Street in Drogheda, Co Louth.

News of the closure of the Drogheda store was first reported last week, with up to 30 staff impacted.

It is understood some workers in the shops that are closing have already been offered redeployment to other Dunnes outlets.

Mandate trade union has said it is currently consulting with its members in affected Dunnes Stores outlets.

The closures come despite industry figures earlier this week suggesting take-home grocery sales in Ireland rose by more than 6% in the month to October, with shoppers spending an additional €67.6m on groceries compared to the same month last year.

The stats, from Worldpanel by Numerator, also indicate Dunnes has the largest market share of any grocery retailer at 24.4%.

Dunnes Stores has been contacted for comment.",RTE,2025-10-23T11:16:04Z,https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1023/1540183-dunnes-to-close-3-grocery-shops/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:31:25.895158

"Another French museum robbery sees 2,000 gold and silver coins stolen","Another French museum robbery sees 2,000 gold and silver coins stolen

1 day ago

Tom McArthur

Around 2,000 gold and silver coins worth around €90,000 (£78,000; $104,000) were stolen during a raid at another French museum - just hours after the audacious theft of some of the French crown jewels at the Louvre in Paris.

The incident happened at a museum dedicated to French philosopher Denis Diderot in Landres, north-eastern France on Sunday night.

When the Maison des Lumières (House of Enlightenment) opened on Tuesday, workers noticed a smashed display case and raised the alarm, officials said. The coins were selected with ""great expertise"", a statement to French media from the local authority said.

It is the latest in a recent string of heists at cultural institutions across France.

The stolen coins date from between 1790 and 1840 and are part of the city's private collection, after being discovered in 2011 during renovation work at the building that now houses the museum, according to local media.

Last month, criminals broke into Paris's Natural History Museum, making off with six gold nuggets worth around €1.5m.

A Chinese national was arrested in Barcelona in connection with this raid while trying to dispose of some melted down gold, according to prosecutors. She was charged earlier this month and is being held in pre-trial detention.

Also in September, thieves stole two Chinese porcelain dishes and a vase with an estimated combined worth of €6.55m from the national porcelain museum in the central city of Limoges. The items are still missing and no arrests have been made.

""They're unsaleable on the art market. The pieces are too easily traceable anyway because they're so well listed,"" a ceramics expert told Le Parisien newspaper at the time.

The heist that has made headlines across the globe was the brazen daylight robbery of €88m worth of historic jewellery from the Louvre museum in Paris.

A gang disguised as workers used power-tools and a mechanical ladder to gain access to the first-floor Gallery of Apollo in the world's most visited museum shortly after it opened on Sunday.

The loot included a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.

Art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC museums across Europe could see a flurry of copycat raids in the coming months.

If someone can target the Louvre and escape with the French crown jewels, local thieves may think ""let's try our nearest museum"", he said.

Security is clearly a problem for many cultural institutions, he said, before adding that compared to a heavily protected jewellery store, a museum with lax security and unarmed guards is a ripe target for robbers.

Louvre Museum

Louvre Museum

The Louvre heist - as well as the other incidents - have raised concerns in France around the lax security at institutions that house some of its most prized treasures.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the heist, the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars told French senators on Wednesday that CCTV around the Louvre's perimeter was weak and ""aging"".

The only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where the theives broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to the gallery housing the jewels, she said.

""We failed these jewels,"" des Cars said, adding that no-one was protected from ""brutal criminals - not even the Louvre"".

A preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.

Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had ""failed"", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a ""terrible image"".

In the case of the gold stolen from the French Natural History Museum, the building's alarm and surveillance systems had been disabled by a cyber-attack, with the thieves apparently aware of this, French media reported at the time.",BBC News,2025-10-23T11:15:20Z,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvzxnzjzzo,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:31:31.645758

The crypto market is looking to regain upside traction, with bitcoin BTC$ 111,174.69 attempting to top $110,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index has risen over 1% in the past 24 hours alongside double-digit gains in a select few tokens such as HYPE, KHYPE and XMR.

Sentiment on social media remains bullish, thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 bps next week, continuing the so-called liquidity easing cycle. Still, it's worth noting that the dollar index is continuing to exhibit bullish price action. A strengthening dollar could limit upside in BTC.

Risk proxies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) aren't supportive either. Both have recently penetrated key support levels. (Check the TA section). Meanwhile, key volume studies point to underlying weakness in the bitcoin market.

Taken together, these factors validate the persistent put bias in BTC options listed on Deribit and Standard Chartered's short-term bearish outlook.

Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that the recent banking funding stress and liquidity tightening are ""keeping BTC anchored and negatively impacting underlying risk dynamics."" Still, they added that the bull run is far from over, pointing to lower bond yields and economic slowdown risks as catalysts for aggressive Fed easing that could cause a ""melt up.""

In traditional markets, oil rose 4% on both sides of the Atlantic after the U.S. imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war. Increased volatility in the oil market could cause risk aversion. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Francisco Rodrigues

Jupiter's native token, JUP, rose more than 3% in the last 24 hours after the decentralized exchange posted strong growth across key business metrics in the third quarter.

The Solana-based project is also pushing to launch its own stablecoin and prediction market.

Quarterly revenue rose 19.2% to $45.8 million, while trading volume, driven by both spot and perpetual products, jumped 71% to $242.8 billion.

Fees generated reached $121.5 million, up nearly 48% from the second quarter. Despite the growth, JUP's market cap edged down 1.5% to $1.35 billion.

Jupiter attributed the growth to new product rollouts, including its Ultra v3 trading engine and a lending protocol that the team says is one of the fastest-growing on Solana. Active wallets increased 5% to 8.4 million, and total value locked (TVL) rose 41.7% to $3.4 billion.

JUP outperformed the wider crypto market, which rose 1.6% based on the performance of the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest (OI) in HYPE futures surged 17% in 24 hours, reaching a two-week high of 40.24 million HYPE. Occurring alongside a rise in price and positive funding rates, the increase indicates growing demand for leveraged bullish exposure.

OI in BTC and ETH has barely changed, a sign traders are reluctant to place bets ahead of Friday's U.S. CPI release.

Volmex's BVIV, which measures the annualized 30-day implied volatility in BTC, has pulled back slightly to 50% but remains well above the September low of 35%. The elevated level reflects persistent concerns arising from newfound risks like auto-deleveraging and liquidity issues.

Funding rates for major cryptocurrencies continue to hover near zero in a sign of balanced market conditions. XMR and BNB rates are slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish short positions.

On Deribit, flows featured BTC put spreads. Overall, puts continue to trade at a premium to calls.

John McManus: The internet broke again and everybody shrugged,"The internet broke again but nobody seems to care.

On Monday morning, somewhere deep in the bowels of an Amazon Web Services data centre in northern Virginia, something happened that brought large swathes of the internet to a shuddering halt.

The shortlist of applications and services that stopped working or did not function properly included Snapchat, Reddit, Slack, Zoom and Venmo. Websites went down, flights were delayed and Amazon deliveries were also disrupted. It is estimated that 1,000 companies were affected by the outage, as were millions of users. The costs could run into the billions.

Amazon – along with Microsoft and Google – provides around two-thirds of the world’s cloud computing infrastructure, on which pretty much every web-based service now sits. Amazon is the largest, with roughly 37 per cent of the market. So when it has a problem, everybody has a problem.

You are unlikely to know what a fault with a domain name system update is – it was the cause of Monday’s outage – and you probably never will. But you do now know that the sort of connectivity that we take for granted is not something we should be taking for granted.

By late afternoon US time on Monday, AWS had fixed the problem. No aircraft fell from the skies and all the traffic lights in New York did not all go green at the same time. It could have been worse.

The public and corporate response to Monday can best be described as a global shrug of the shoulders. “Everyone has a bad day, today Amazon had a bad day,” was the view of Matthew Price, the chief executive of Cloudflare, one of Amazon’s smaller rivals.

He should know. A faulty update from CrowdStrike – one of his company’s strategic partners – caused 8.5 million devices running on Microsoft Windows to crash in July last year. The result was chaos across the globe that took 10 days to resolve.

Our collective insouciance about the vulnerability of the web to these sorts of events is perhaps not surprising given the regularity with which they occur; roughly every 12 months on average. Other significant outages include all of Meta’s data centres being disconnected in 2021 when someone apparently pressed the wrong button.

[ Amazon Web Services outage underlines vulnerability of web-based societyOpens in new window ]

The result was that Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp went offline for the best part of seven hours. Some might argue this was a blessing, but not Meta shareholders, who saw $47 billion wiped off the company’s market capitalisation.

Google went dark for almost an hour in 2020 after a switch over to a new system went wrong. In 2021 Fastly, which provided content delivery for the BBC, Shopify, Amazon, CNN, and the US and UK governments was down for a similar period due to a faulty update.

The Earth did not stop spinning on any of these occasions and, given the sheer size of the infrastructure supporting the internet, they are incredibly rare. From this perspective, the inconvenience caused by the occasional outage is a price worth paying for the benefits offered by global connectivity. Hence our complacency.

You do have to wonder if this calculus will hold up in the brave new world of artificial intelligence. Its biggest proponents argue that it will run everything and do everything better than humans can.

By coincidence, the Wall Street Journal – whose website was reportedly affected by the AWS outage – ran a lengthy article on Monday describing the mania that seems to have gripped all the big technology players as they commit more and more money to build the infrastructure for a version of artificial intelligence that does not yet exist.

It is not just the big cloud computing companies such as AWS and Microsoft that have gone all-in on the vision peddled by Sam Altman, the messianic leader of OpenAI – the company behind ChatGPT – and others.

[ ChatGPT-5: Maybe Sam Altman should cool the jets on new AI iterationsOpens in new window ]

The world’s leading microchip makers and other hardware companies have bought into the notion that AI will do everything everywhere. They have committed to spending $1 trillion to provide the infrastructure that Altman says will be needed to achieve the goal of singularity – the moment when AI can achieve and exceed a human level of reasoning.

When put together with the investment planned by OpenAI’s rivals – Elon Musk’s xAI and Anthropic – the figures become meaningless, and unsurprisingly there is considerable concern that there is a bubble about to burst. The phrase “too big to fail” is being bandied about, which usually signals something is about to fail and get bailed out by taxpayers.

Absent from the debate seems to be any clear-eyed assessment of how the risks of the internet breaking will increase, as the points of potential failure grow exponentially. As will the consequences of an outage as AI gets deeply embedded into every aspect of our lives.

The glib answer is that AI will anticipate and solve this problem. Worth noting is that among the applications that went down on Monday was ChatGPT.",The Irish Times,2025-10-23T11:12:38Z,https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/10/23/john-mcmanus-the-internet-broke-again-and-everybody-shrugged/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:31:56.013406

"Gold price today rebounds 2% after 6% crash — Why gold rate is surging now, will the gold rally continue or reverse? silver jumps 1.6% too","Synopsis

Gold price jumps 2% today after falling 6% yesterday. Safe-haven demand is back. US shutdown and trade fears with China are pushing gold higher. XAU/USD trades near $4,115, still up 60% in 2025. Technicals look solid, with gold sitting well above its 100-day EMA and a healthy RSI. Keep an eye on resistance at $4,140 and support at $4,000. Big moves could come from trade talks and inflation data soon. Friday’s US CPI data could decide if the rally continues or if this is a short-term rebound.

Gold price today climbed higher on Thursday, supported by strong safe-haven demand as the prolonged US government shutdown and global trade tensions continued to rattle investor confidence.

Spot Gold (XAU/USD) was trading around $4,115 an ounce, up 0.40% for the day, while Gold futures (GC00) gained 1.1% to $4,111.50, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The yellow metal rebounded after Tuesday’s steep 5.7% drop—its largest single-day fall in over 12 years.

Markets are pricing in a 97% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Lower rates typically reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold, lending further support to bullion prices.

Investors are awaiting the release of September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Friday — a key inflation indicator that could shape near-term Fed policy. A hotter-than-expected CPI may strengthen the U.S. Dollar (USD) and briefly cap gold’s upside, while softer inflation would reinforce rate-cut expectations.

According to the daily chart, the constructive outlook for gold remains intact. The price is well-supported above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signaling ongoing bullish strength.

Live Events

RSI (14-day) stands near 57.25, staying above the neutral 50 line.

Immediate resistance is at $4,140 (October 15 high).

A break above this could open the door to $4,330 (October 16 high) and the Bollinger Band upper limit at $4,365.

Support levels: $4,000 (psychological level), $3,947 (October 10 low), and $3,838 (October 3 low).

Technical indicators suggest that as long as XAU/USD stays above $4,000, the broader uptrend remains intact.

Geopolitical risks continue to underpin gold’s strength. The U.S.-China trade standoff and the prolonged Washington budget impasse are keeping investors cautious.

The White House is reportedly weighing export restrictions on software and high-tech goods to China, which could intensify trade friction. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is set to meet China’s Xi Jinping next week in South Korea, a meeting markets hope could ease tensions.

In addition, the Middle East conflict and Ukraine war remain key sources of global uncertainty, further supporting safe-haven flows into gold.

Gold continues to behave both as a growth and defensive asset in 2025. While short-term corrections may persist, analysts expect strong structural support from central bank demand, monetary easing, and global uncertainty.

Looking forward, gold’s longer-term rally is expected to continue supported by persistent inflation risks, central bank purchases, and structural geopolitical uncertainties, but near-term volatility will remain as markets assess trade negotiations, inflation data, and Fed actions.

Key support for gold lies near $4,000, while resistance stands around $4,140 to $4,330. The recent crash was not a signal of a reversed bull run but a correction, offering buying opportunities amid a fundamentally bullish backdrop.

Why is gold rising today?

Gold is rising today primarily due to safe-haven demand amid the ongoing US government shutdown and persistent geopolitical tensions. The precious metal is trading around $4,121, up about 1.38% for the day, supported strongly above its 100-day Exponential Moving Average and boosted by positive momentum from the Relative Strength Index near 57. Key resistance levels to watch are $4,140 and $4,330, with support at the critical $4,000 psychological level.

Investors remain cautious ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, now delayed to Friday due to the shutdown. Softer inflation expectations boost the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut next week, with markets pricing in about a 97% chance of a 25 basis point reduction. Lower interest rates make gold more attractive by reducing the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset.

US-China trade tensions continue to influence market sentiment. While recent talks and an upcoming high-level meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi, provide hope for easing tensions, trade war fears still sustain demand for gold as a safe haven. The US administration is also weighing new export restrictions on China, keeping volatility elevated.

Additional factors include strong retail and festival demand in major gold-consuming regions like India, where 24K gold prices hold steady around ₹12,508 per gram despite global market fluctuations. The prolonged US shutdown adds economic uncertainty, reinforcing gold's role as a store of value amid fiscal and geopolitical instability.

Technically, after a sharp rally earlier in October, gold has corrected somewhat but remains in a bullish longer-term trend supported by large central bank purchasing, geopolitical risks, and expectations of monetary easing. The recent correction was partly driven by profit-taking and a brief resurgence of the US dollar, which increases gold's cost for holders of other currencies.

Markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut next week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Expectations of lower interest rates continue to support gold, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. On the daily chart, gold remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signaling a constructive long-term trend. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 57.25, suggesting steady bullish momentum.

Immediate resistance is seen at $4,140, the October 15 high. A breakout above this could drive prices toward $4,330 (October 16 high) and then $4,365, the upper Bollinger Band.

On the downside, key support lies near the $4,000 psychological mark. A sustained drop below the October 10 low of $3,947 could trigger further declines toward $3,838, the October 3 low.

Safe-haven boost amid global uncertainty

Gold’s recovery follows weeks of volatility fueled by Middle East tensions, Ukraine conflict concerns, and renewed US-China trade friction. Reports suggest the White House is considering export restrictions on software and technology to China, escalating fears of a trade war.

However, optimism remains after President Donald Trump confirmed a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in South Korea, which could ease some geopolitical pressure.

2025 performance and broader precious metals rally

Despite recent turbulence, gold remains up nearly 60% year-to-date in 2025, outperforming major commodities and indices. The surge has been largely driven by record central bank purchases, monetary easing expectations, and safe-haven inflows.

Other precious metals also advanced:

Silver (SI00) jumped 1.6% to $48.42.

Platinum (PL00) gained 3.3% to $1,603.20.

Newmont Corp. (NEM) shares rose 0.8% after recovering from a 9% decline during Tuesday’s selloff. The miner remains up 76.7% year-to-date.

Analyst insights: Correction, Not Collapse

“Tuesday’s sell-off was largely technical, driven by profit-taking after months of overbought conditions,” said Russell Shor, Senior Market Analyst at Tradu.com. “Despite the correction, the longer-term uptrend remains intact, supported by strong structural demand.”

MUFG analyst Soojin Kim noted that a large ETF outflow earlier this week reflected “short-term profit-taking,” not a change in fundamental demand.

Investors will closely watch Friday’s US CPI data, which could determine near-term price direction. A hotter-than-expected print may strengthen the US dollar and briefly cap gold’s gains. Conversely, softer inflation could reinforce expectations of further Fed rate cuts—providing another leg up for the metal.

Even with profit-taking and short-term volatility, gold’s macro backdrop remains bullish—anchored by central bank accumulation, falling yields, and geopolitical risk.

FAQs:

1. Why is the gold price rising today?

Gold prices are rising due to renewed safe-haven demand as geopolitical tensions grow and the U.S. government shutdown continues. Investors also expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates, which weakens the dollar and boosts gold.

2. Is this a real recovery or just a technical rebound?

Analysts suggest this is partly a technical rebound after heavy profit-taking. However, strong fundamental drivers—like rate-cut expectations and central bank demand—support a sustained uptrend if prices stay above $4,000.

3. What key levels should traders watch now?

Immediate resistance sits near $4,140, with major upside targets at $4,330 and $4,365. On the downside, support lies around $4,000 and $3,947. A drop below $3,947 could signal a deeper correction.

4. Will gold prices rise further in 2025?

If global uncertainties persist and the Fed eases policy, analysts expect gold could test $4,300–$4,400 later this year. Long-term trends remain bullish given inflation, rate cuts, and central bank accumulation.

The Economic Times Soonicorns Sundowner in Mumbai is all set to propel the Indian startup conversation on October 29, 2025, continuing the momentum built by its flagship ET Soonicorns Summit and its reimagined 2025 edition. Following in the footsteps of the high-energy Hyderabad and Gurugram editions, this Sundowner is set to tap into Mumbai’s fast-evolving ecosystem of soonicorns and minicorns, ventures that embody the spirit and drive powering India’s next generation of unicorns.

Mumbai’s entrepreneurial fabric is woven through the confluence of finance, technology, and cultural dynamism, making it a hotbed for innovation. This event is designed not merely as a gathering but as a curated platform to foster meaningful conversations about regional growth, challenges, and opportunities. As the country’s dynamics shift towards decentralised innovation hubs, understanding Mumbai’s unique ecosystem becomes vital for investors, founders, and policy enablers alike.

This Sundowner aims to spotlight this unique fusion and the startups boldly navigating its currents through regionally focused, candid conversations and knowledge exchange. As India’s startup ecosystem becomes increasingly diverse and polycentric, the Sundowner is positioned as an initiative for founders, investors, and ecosystem enablers to delve into the city’s unique challenges, opportunities, and growth avenues.

The opening notes

The Sundowner will kick off with registrations, gathering a diverse mix of entrepreneurs, investors, policy leaders, and ecosystem architects. Deepak Ajwani, Editor at EconomicTimes.com, will inaugurate the event, setting the stage with insights on how regional nuances shape Mumbai’s startup narrative and why this localised focus is critical to appreciating India’s multifaceted innovation landscape.

Following this introduction, a keynote address from a Maharashtra State Innovation Society spokesperson will highlight the government’s proactive steps to craft an enabling environment for startups—from infrastructural support to innovation-friendly policies—underscoring Maharashtra’s pivotal role in fostering India’s innovation economy.

A major highlight will be the launch of the Economic Times Top Soonicorns and Minicorns of Maharashtra 2025 report, in collaboration with Research Partner Tracxn, which will be jointly unveiled by Deepak Ajwani, Editor, EconomicTimes.com , and a representative from 360 ONE.

This comprehensive analysis offers an in-depth look at Maharashtra’s emerging startups, spotlighting them as beacons of innovation and scale. Investors, policymakers, and founders alike will gain valuable intelligence on emerging sectors, market trends, and investment hotspots.

From founders’ stories to investors’ hot takes

The event will then feature two compelling TED-style talks featuring leading founders. Kunal Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of EMotorad, will reflect on his journey in sustainable electric mobility, sharing insights into how technology intersects with environmental goals to revolutionise transportation. Eklavya Gupta, Founder of Recur Club, will share the story behind his software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription platform’s rapid growth, delving into challenges and strategies relevant to business-to-business (B2B) tech entrepreneurs.

Following the founder spotlights, a marquee panel discussion entitled ‘Changing Metrics While Raising a Round of Capital’ will engage some of the most seasoned investors in India’s startup ecosystem. Rajat Mangala of General Atlantic, Chetan Naik of 360One, and Abhishek Jain of Eight Roads will delve into the shifting landscape of startup funding: how valuation metrics, investors’ expectations, and capital allocation tactics are evolving, and what founders need to know to successfully navigate this new terrain.

In a departure from structured sessions, two open mic rounds will invite attendees to share their own experiences and narratives. This interactive segment is aimed at fostering candid dialogue and peer learning, offering a platform to voice challenges, celebrate milestones, and spark spontaneous collaboration.

As the formal programme concludes, the evening will transition into an informal networking session. This relaxed setting will facilitate deeper conversations, connection-building, and deal-making, all essential ingredients for propelling Maharashtra’s startup ecosystem. It is here that formal insights transition into practical opportunities, as relationships and ideas flow freely.

The Mumbai edition of the ET Soonicorns Sundowner encapsulates the city’s unique vigour and ambition—a confluence where entrepreneurial aspirations meet actionable insights, where the next generation of billion-dollar companies takes its first definitive steps. This event is more than a gathering; it’s a celebration of Mumbai’s enduring status as a global startup powerhouse and a harbinger of India’s innovation future.

By directing attention to Maharashtra’s soonicorns and minicorns, this edition of the ET Soonicorns Sundowner reinforces The Economic Times’ mission to highlight and nurture India’s regional innovation hubs. Recognising that India’s startup story is far from monolithic, it champions ecosystem diversity as foundational to sustainable growth, playing an indispensable role in sculpting the country’s future business landscape.

This Sundowner series aims to deepen the understanding of Mumbai’s startup fabric, spotlighting local stories that exemplify innovation, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence.

It is against this backdrop that the ET Soonicorns Summit Sundowner series emerges as an ecosystem accelerator and morphs into an essential forum where ideas spark, relationships form, and the next generation of unicorns begins to take shape.

360 One is the Presenting Partner of the ET Soonicorns Summit 2025 , with Tracxn as Research Partner.

How Italian brain rot is becoming Gen Alpha’s latest toy obsession,"Toys modelled after viral creations, such as a jet-powered crocodile named “bombardino crocodilo"" and a wooden log with a baseball bat dubbed “tung tung tung sahur"" from an Indonesian folklore, are flying off toy shelves, following in the footsteps of the viral Labubu doll craze.

“Brain rot"", Oxford's word of the year for 2024, refers to a category of memes defined by low-grade internet humour—addictive, chaotic, and often symbolic of mental burnout from excessive scrolling.

The origin of this genre of bizarre, algorithmically generated characters on TikTok earlier this year was just as random: it began with the reinterpretation of the Italian filler lyrics “trallalero trallallà"" as a Nike-wearing shark.

That spawned a series of similar surreal creations—a cappuccino mug performing ballet in a tutu skirt called “ballerina cappucina,"" a cactus-elephant hybrid named “lirili larila,"" and many more.

Users built elaborate fictional worlds around them—complete with fights, rankings, and love stories—before the memes migrated from global feeds to Indian Instagram pages.

The latest online meme has now evolved into a global consumer trend, shaping the physical toy market. The rise of Italian brain-rot toys marks a cultural shift in how the youngest generation experiences creativity and play. For Gen Alpha, raised on AI and memes, the boundary between virtual imagination and real-world toys is vanishing fast.

Gen Alpha's latest obsession

Gen Alpha kids, born between 2010 and 2024, are hooked on games featuring Italian brain rot characters on popular gaming platforms like Roblox.

“We grew up in a time when access to technology came later in life, but Gen Alpha are digital natives—they’ve grown up with screens from their earliest years,"" said Archit Madaan, founder of The Indian Sarcasm, a meme page that has evolved into a marketing agency managing hundreds of meme accounts.

“That’s why AI-generated, mix-and-match content like Italian brain rot resonates so strongly with them; what we could only imagine as kids, they can now bring to life with just a few clicks.""

Toy industry and 3D printers cash in

Toy makers, especially Chinese exporters and Indian 3D-printing startups, are capitalising on the craze.

Chinese exporters supply these toys to India, while indigenous 3D printers and small local manufacturers try to cash in on the trend while it lasts. ""In the case of labubu dolls, we noted that the Chinese resellers and toy makers made more money than Pop Mart, the actual creators of it,"" he added.

A quick search for “Italian brainrot"" toys or specific character names on e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart and Amazon pulls up dozens of buying options, typically priced between ₹200 and ₹300 per piece, with larger figurines costing more. Bundled sets of multiple toys sell for ₹800– ₹1,500. A closer look reveals that many of these listings come from 3D toy makers.

“About six months ago, my nine-year-old son told me about the Italian brainrot trend and asked me to print 3D versions of those characters,"" said Rahul Chandalia, cofounder and chief executive officer of Wol3D, a 3D printing prototype company that ventured into toy manufacturing last year under the Vinglits brand.

These samples started gaining traction in the market. “Even though we focus on customised products- a relatively new category- we’ve already sold over a thousand Italian brainrot toys,"" Chandalia said.

Wol3D supplies these customised figurines to resellers, who then list and sell them on Amazon, Flipkart, and Instagram stores.

According to Chandalia, characters like ‘tung tung tung sahur’ are among the most popular, followed by ‘tralalelo tralala’ and ‘ballerina cappucina’. There is also strong demand for ‘bombardino crocodilo’ and ‘chimpanzini bananini’, combining a chimpanzee and a banana.

The trend has also encouraged many parents to purchase 3D printers, priced around ₹20,000, for their children instead of individual toys, allowing them to experiment with AI tools and design. The company currently sells about 15,000-20,000 units per year.

“One key takeaway from this trend is that kids connect better with toys that have names and stories around them, so we’re building stronger character identities across our range,"" Chandalia said.

Most demand comes from parents of nine to twelve-year-olds, although many adults also purchase these figurines as desk or room showpieces to keep up with social media trends.

Chandalia added that 3D printed trend-driven toys are a highly profitable segment, with margins of around 30%, given the low production cost of ₹50 per piece. Wol3D currently operates over 250 machines and plans to double it by April 2026. “When fidget spinners were all the rage, we sold over 6,000 pieces,"" he recalled.

While several new companies in India have begun producing 3D-printed trendy toys, the market remains largely dominated by Chinese imports. Many manufacturers and resellers marketing their products as 'Made in India' actually source the components from China and assemble them locally.

“Indigenous toy manufacturing is not as big in India as people claim it to be,"" Ankur Bisen, senior partner at consulting firm The Knowledge Company, told Mint. “There may be spurts here and there, but no local manufacturing clusters in toys have emerged.""

""Most small units claiming to make toys in India are in reality just importing from China and assembling here, as is the case in other consumer categories too. Else, these imports come from Thailand, or increasingly from Vietnam.""

Even in the case of Labubu dolls, there were many copies in India. ""But they were not being made here,"" he said. However, it is hard to determine if 3D printing units in India listed as sellers of these toys are actually making them in the country.

It is difficult to gauge the size of the toy manufacturing market in the country, with very few reliable estimates available, as local units often bypass legal barriers to Chinese imports. In May last year, the trade research organisation Global Trade Research Initiative estimated India’s toy exports at $152.3 million for FY24 and imports at $64.9 million.

Parents’ dilemma

Parents, meanwhile, are both amused and exasperated. “Just two months ago, my nine-year-old threw a tantrum demanding a Labubu toy…she was totally obsessed with it until her friends shifted to the latest craze, the Italian brain rot characters,"" said Geetu Kapoor, a mother of two and primary school teacher. “It’s not just her, every child in my class talks about these characters.""

Reels from influencers, particularly parenting creators, are going viral as they discover and react to these bizarrely named Italian brainrot toys they’ve bought for their kids.

“What started as a fun video quickly turned into an online discussion,"" said Akash Dodeja, who has been making content since 2015 and has over 426,000 followers on Instagram.

“Our comments were flooded with millennials like us, equally shocked by what Gen Alpha kids are watching and playing with.""

Many of the posts on how absurd yet strangely catchy these character names highlight the widening generational gap between millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Alpha (born from around 2013 onward). Parents say it is harder to relate to Gen Alpha than Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012), a group known for its social media trends and internet slang.

""I’m 45 now, and Spiderman toys I played with as a child are still enjoyed by my kids. But these trendy toys like Italian brain rot, Labubus, and Pop Its are nothing but a rat race. Their shelf life is just a few months, fuelled by peer pressure among children rather than genuine interest,"" Kappor said.

Italian brainrot is a rabbit hole, Dodeja said. “It hooks you with one video, makes you curious as you discover more ridiculous yet catchy characters, and before you know it, you’re tracking dozens of variations, and for all you know, these can become prized collectables in the future if brands hop on to these.

It’s unending because it’s AI-generated — you can literally create anything. That’s the kind of disruption AI has brought to the creator economy, and as creators, we have to keep up. ""But as of yet, I only see this concept of Italian brainrot growing into a pop culture moment,"" he said.",Livemint,2025-10-23T11:10:08Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/italian-brain-rot-gen-alpha-toys-tiktok-toy-trends-ai-generated-memes-brain-rot-meme-toys-viral-toys-india-11761123835654.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:32:15.853500
SOPA urges Centre not to allow import of GM soyabean meal from US,"The Soyabean Processors Association of India (SOPA) has urged the Government not to allow the imports of genetically modified (GM) soyabean meal imports from the US stating that it would adversely impact domestic agriculture and undermine the Atmarnirbhar Bharat vision.

In a letter to the Commerce Secretary, Rajesh Agrawal, SOPA chairman Davish Jain said India currently has than sufficient stocks of soyabean meal to meet the domestic demand and “permitting imports at this juncture will have devastating consequences for the Indian agriculture sector.”

SOPA estimates total soyabean meal supply for the 2025-26 marketing season starting October at 78.98 lakh tonnes, much higher than the domestic feed sector consumption of 62 lakh tonnes. SOPA estimates the food sector requirement at 8 lakh tonnes and exports of 8 lakh tonnes for the year.

Total soyameal supply consists of carry over stocks of 1.08 lakh tonnes and domestic production of 77.90 lakh tonnes as per SOPA’s estimates. SOPA said the Government estimate of production would be much higher than the trade projections.

“Imports will severely harm soyabean farmers who are already suffering from prices well below the minimum support prices. The imports will further depress soyabean market prices due to an artificial supply glut deepening farmers distress and jeopardise the viability of the domestic soyabean processing industry, threatening thousands of livelihoods,” Jain said.

“Also allowing imports would undermine the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision by weakening India’s globally recognised non-GMO soyabean supply leadership,” Jain added.

Enviable reputation

“India has built an enviable reputation as a supplier of high-quality Non-GMO Soybean products, providing a competitive edge in domestic and international markets-especially as many global buyers explicitly demand traceable, non-GMO origins. Allowing GM imports risks eroding this hard-eamed leadership and could sabotage years of efforts to attain self-reliance in high-value segments,” Jain said.

SOPA requested the Government to refrain from including GM Soybean Meal under the BTA (Bilateral Trade Agreements)/ import allowances and safeguard India’s non-GMO Soybean cultivation, processing, and export ecosystem, besides taking urgent steps to support domestic soyabean farmers by ensuring the market remains favourable, transparent, and protected from disruptive imports. “We seek your immediate intervention to protect the interests of millions of Indian farmers, hundreds of processors, and allied industries, and to uphold the nation’s commitment to Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” Jain added.

Trusted Source Says Galaxy S26 Launch Won’t Happen in January,"A sketchy rumor recently said that Samsung is planning to postpone the Galaxy S26 series from January to March next year. It seemed vary far-fetched at the time, but that’s not necessarily the case. A trusted source just confirmed that the launch is indeed getting delayed.

A trusted source has just confirmed that the Galaxy S26 series won’t launch in January

The information comes from Ice Universe, one of the most prominent tipsters out there. He went to Weibo to confirm the information, even though he did not say when the phones would launch. The launch has been delayed, but that doesn’t mean we’ll have to wait until March. That would be a very odd choice for Samsung.

Why is that? Well, Samsung seems to be making some last-minute changes, and that’s never a good thing. The company probably needs more time to get everything in order and prepare enough units.

As many of you know, we’ve exclusively revealed the designs of the Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. Well, according to more recent rumors, Samsung is now opting to ditch the Galaxy S26 Pro and Galaxy S26 Edge, and launch the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26+ instead.

We don’t know if that will affect the designs of the two phones, or will the company just change the names, but that’s what’s rumored. The Galaxy S26 Ultra model will likely remain unchanged from what we’ve shown you.

The Exynos 2600 could be one of the reasons for the delayed launch

Another reason for the delay could be the Exynos 2600. Samsung started mass-producing that 2nm chip, and it was supposed to be used in half of the Galaxy S26 units worldwide. Well, the company allegedly has some yield issues.

All in all, things are not looking as great for Samsung right now. The company’s market share isn’t exactly booming, and a lot is riding on the Samsung Galaxy S26 series. News that the phones won’t exactly get major upgrades, especially in the camera department, didn’t sit well with users.

It remains to be seen what will come out of all this, but it sure seems like all Galaxy S26 phones are getting delayed, unfortunately.",Android Headlines,2025-10-23T11:08:03Z,https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/10/samsung-galaxy-s26-series-launch-delayed-trusted-source.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:32:32.392666

iPhone Air may have the same tragic end as the Galaxy S26 Edge,"Samsung brought out its slim flagship, the Galaxy S25 Edge, earlier this year. It launched the device months ahead of Apple's rumored iPhone Air, which had been generating a bit of hype among tech enthusiast circles.

While there's nothing really wrong with the Galaxy S25 Edge, it doesn't seem to be selling as well as Samsung may have hoped, leading to reports of its cancellation. It appears that Apple's iPhone Air may be heading to the same tragic end.

Apple's not making very many units anymore

It has been reported multiple times over the past few months that the Galaxy S25 Edge sales aren't that good. Samsung was expected to replace the Galaxy S26+ with the Galaxy S26 Edge next year, but the sluggish sales have reportedly made it reconsider.

The latest reports have claimed that the Galaxy S26 Edge has effectively been canceled for next year largely because the current device hasn't been selling well. The Galaxy S26+ will live on and there's no saying if and when the Edge will make a return.

There have already been reports that iPhone Air sales aren't that spectacular, either. Apple is believed to have cut production volumes of the device as the units aren't moving fast enough. A new report from Nikkei Asia claims that Apple has cut orders for the iPhone Air to “end of production” levels.

This would suggest that the company may not make any additional units as it has more than enough supply on hand to meet the demand, which has been slower than anticipated. Production has been cut to these levels despite the iPhone Air launching in China only last week, a country that's typically a very strong market for Apple.

In the absence of stellar sales performance, Apple may have to make the same decision that Samsung did, which was to get rid of the device altogether.",SamMobile,2025-10-23T11:05:10Z,https://www.sammobile.com/news/iphone-air-may-have-the-same-tragic-end-as-the-galaxy-s26-edge/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:33:39.548689
Mobileye beats quarterly revenue estimates,"Mobileye Global beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on Thursday, as automakers ramped up orders of the company's driver-assisted chips in a rush to adopt autonomous software.

The company is seeing a surge in demand for its self-driving systems after a prolonged slump as its customers clear inventory. Mobileye's customers had stocked up to avoid a shortage during the pandemic.

""Continued auto production stability gives us confidence to again raise our full-year outlook, removing conservatism we had embedded earlier due to macro uncertainty,"" said Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua.

The company also added Volvo as a new customer, executives said on a post-earnings conference call.

Still, even as demand grows, economic uncertainty lingers as the imposition of tariffs on imports of automobiles and parts has pressured many of Mobileye's customers, forcing them to readjust supply chains.

Mobileye previously said it would not be directly impacted by the duties.

Company executives cautioned about margin pressure next year as Mobileye ramps up volume shipments of lower-margin products, but said they would improve in 2027 as product mix shifts to higher margin chips.

The chipmaker, of which Intel is the largest shareholder, has previously flagged revenue potential from the robotaxi industry as several firms eye a larger portion of the fledgling market.

Mobileye has been collaborating with firms such as Lyft to roll out autonomous taxis - which analysts say will be increasingly competitive in a few years with a large market.

The company reported third-quarter revenue of $504 million, beating estimates of $480.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company raised the lower end of its annual revenue forecast.

Mobileye beats quarterly revenue estimates on resilient self-driving chip demand,"Mobileye Global beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on Thursday, as automakers ramped up orders of the company's driver-assisted chips in a rush to adopt autonomous software.

The company is seeing a surge in demand for its self-driving systems after a prolonged slump as its customers clear inventory. Mobileye's customers had stocked up to avoid a shortage during the pandemic.

""Continued auto production stability gives us confidence to again raise our full-year outlook, removing conservatism we had embedded earlier due to macro uncertainty,"" said Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua.

The company also added Volvo as a new customer, executives said on a post-earnings conference call.

Still, even as demand grows, economic uncertainty lingers as the imposition of tariffs on imports of automobiles and parts has pressured many of Mobileye's customers, forcing them to readjust supply chains.

Mobileye previously said it would not be directly impacted by the duties.

Company executives cautioned about margin pressure next year as Mobileye ramps up volume shipments of lower-margin products, but said they would improve in 2027 as product mix shifts to higher margin chips.

The chipmaker, of which Intel is the largest shareholder, has previously flagged revenue potential from the robotaxi industry as several firms eye a larger portion of the fledgling market.

Mobileye has been collaborating with firms such as Lyft to roll out autonomous taxis - which analysts say will be increasingly competitive in a few years with a large market.

"PS5 sales are looking good despite recent price hikes, officially overtaking the PS3 in lifetime sales in the US","The PS5 has surpassed the PS3 in lifetime sales in the US

Circana analyst Mat Piscatella says the PS5 is also ahead of the PS4 by 4.6% as of September 2025

That's despite Sony increasing the price of all its PS5 consoles last month

The PlayStation 5 has officially outsold the PlayStation 3 in lifetime sales in the US as of September 2025.

That's according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who wrote on Bluesky (via NotebookCheck) that PS5 sales have now overtook the PS3, and that the console is even ahead of the PS4 by 4.6%, despite Sony increasing the price of the current-gen console in August.

""September 2025 US video game data fun fact - The PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base. So that's cool,"" Piscatella said.

Though Piscatella didn't share specific stats, he added in the replies: ""In the US, PS5 has been ahead of PS4 on a time aligned basis for a very long time. As of September (month 59 in market), PS5 is ahead of PS4 by 4.6%.""

According to Sony, the PS4 has sold more than 113.5 million units (as of September 30, 2020), while the PS3 has sold more than 87.4 million (as of March 2017). To this day, the PS2 remains the company's best-selling console of all time, with more than 160 million(as of March 31, 2012).

Sony hasn't updated its business data sales yet, so these figures have likely changed since their recorded dates. As of June 30, 2025, the PS5 had sold more than 80.2 million units, and we know the console has far exceeded that number, given the latest report from Piscatella.

Pricing for the PS5 went through some major changes last month, with the cost of the standard edition increasing from $499.99 to $549.99. The cheaper PS5 Digital Edition also went from $449.99 to $499.99, while the latest PS5 Pro was hiked from $699.99 to $749.99.

Article content

1 Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on the fair value increment recognized on acquisition of Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For purposes of calculating adjusted net income, we believe the magnitude of this depreciation and amortization, which was significantly affected by the size of the Shaw Transaction, may have no correlation to our current and ongoing operating results and affects comparability between certain periods. Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of $210 million and $651 million (2024 – $227 million and $689 million). Adjusted net income includes depreciation and amortization on the acquired Shaw property, plant and equipment and intangible assets based on Shaw’s historical cost and depreciation policies.

2 Finance costs exclude the $151 million gain on repayment of long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Finance costs also exclude the $134 million and $41 million change in fair value of subsidiary equity derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Effective the second quarter of 2025 and as a result of closing the network transaction, we believe removing this amount more accurately reflects our ongoing operational results as these derivative instruments economically hedge the foreign exchange impacts of the network transaction but they are not eligible to be accounted for as hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “Financial Risk Management – Subsidiary equity derivatives” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more details on these derivative instruments.

3 Other income excludes a $5,016 million gain on revaluation of our existing investment in MLSE as a result of the MLSE Transaction.

4 Income tax expense excludes recoveries of $42 million and $194 million (2024 – recoveries of $82 million and $263 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to the income tax impact for adjusted items.

Article content

Effective the second quarter of 2025, as a result of the closing of the network transaction, we introduced a new non-GAAP measure – adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders. In addition to the adjustments applied to net income to calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders further adjusts net income attributable to RCI shareholders by removing the impacts of foreign exchange revaluation within BNSI as the subsidiary equity derivatives we have entered into economically and effectively hedge our foreign exchange exposures arising from the investment.

Key Performance Indicators

Article content

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2024 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

Article content

continued competitive intensity in all segments in which we operate consistent with levels experienced in 2024;

no significant additional legal or regulatory developments, other shifts in economic conditions, or macro changes in the competitive environment affecting our business activities;

overall wireless market penetration in Canada continues to grow in 2025;

continued subscriber growth in retail Internet;

declining Television and Satellite subscribers, including the impact of customers migrating to Rogers Xfinity TV from our legacy Television product, as subscription streaming services and other over-the-top providers continue to grow in popularity;

in Media, continued growth in sports (including at MLSE) and similar trends in 2025 as in 2024 in other traditional media businesses;

no significant sports-related work stoppages or cancellations will occur;

with respect to capital expenditures:

similar levels of capital investment associated with (i) expanding our 5G wireless network and (ii) upgrading our hybrid fibre-coaxial network to lower the number of homes passed per node, utilize the latest technologies, and deliver an even more reliable customer experience; and

we continue to make expenditures related to our Home roadmap in 2025 and we make progress on our service footprint expansion projects;

a substantial portion of our 2025 US dollar-denominated expenditures is hedged at an average exchange rate of $1.34/US$;

key interest rates remain relatively stable throughout 2025; and

we retain our investment-grade credit ratings.

Inventus Announces Engagement of Industry Veteran Ed Baer for Investor Relations,"This News Release includes certain “forward-looking statements” which are not comprised of historical facts. Forward-looking statements include estimates and statements that describe the Company’s future plans, objectives or goals, including words to the effect that the Company or management expects a stated condition or result to occur. Forward-looking statements may be identified by such terms as “believes”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “estimates”, “may”, “could”, “would”, “if”, “yet”, “potential”, “undetermined”, “objective”, or “plan”. Since forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Although these statements are based on information currently available to the Company, the Company provides no assurance that actual results will meet management’s expectations. Risks, uncertainties and other factors involved with forward-looking information could cause actual events, results, performance, prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Forward-looking information in this news release includes, but is not limited to, the Company’s objectives, goals or future plans, statements, exploration results, potential mineralization, the estimation of mineral resources, exploration and mine development plans, timing of the commencement of operations and estimates of market conditions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking information include, but are not limited to the failure to identify mineral resources, failure to convert estimated mineral resources to reserves, the inability to complete a feasibility study which recommends a production decision, the preliminary nature of metallurgical test results, delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other project approvals, political risks, inability to fulfill the duty to accommodate First Nations and other indigenous peoples, uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing needed in the future, changes in equity markets, inflation, changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in commodity prices, delays in the development of projects, capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates and the other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry, and those risks set out in the Company’s public documents filed on SEDAR+. Although the Company believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking information in this news release are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information, which only applies as of the date of this news release, and no assurance can be given that such events will occur in the disclosed time frames or at all. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law.",Financial Post,2025-10-23T11:04:06Z,https://financialpost.com/globe-newswire/inventus-announces-engagement-of-industry-veteran-ed-baer-for-investor-relations,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:34:15.077639

"iPhone Air production is getting cut, and Kuo says the Pros are to blame","Weak demand for Apple’s ultra-slim iPhone Air is causing production cuts, while the Pro models continue to dominate.

Apparently, Apple's ultra-slim iPhone Air is in trouble... recently, a rumor came out from Korea claiming that Apple is cutting its iPhone Air production orders, which meant the slim-chic device is falling short of expectations. Now, reputable analyst Ming-Chu Kuo is joining in, corroborating the sad news for the slim phone fans.

Kuo thinks the iPhone 17 Pro killed the iPhone Air

Kuo is the latest voice to join in with multiple sources claiming that Apple is cutting orders for the iPhone Air and ordering more Pro models. Reportedly, the iPhone Air's production is being adjusted to reflect the lackluster demand for the phone.

According to the tipster, the supply chain is scaling back production capacity for the iPhone Air. What's even more shocking is that Kuo claims most suppliers are cutting capacity by more than 80% by the first quarter of 2026. Components with longer lead times are said to be discontinued by the end of 2025.

Currently, it's unclear whether Kuo has new data on iPhone Air production or is simply joining in on earlier reports.

It seems the Pro models are just way too good

Kuo's opinion is that what's happening with the iPhone Air is a trend with Apple's product lines, because of the Pro models. Kuo believes that the Pro models and the standard one are already covering the majority of high-end user demand well, which leaves little room for Apple to create new markets.

Are ultra-slim phones worth it, or do you prefer more battery and features?

The same was seen before with the mini model, and that's the fate of the Plus model as well. Now, it's the Air that's fallen victim to the Pro-ness of the Pros.

Reportedly, Apple is revising manufacturing orders – it seems the Cupertino giant is increasing overall production for the iPhone 17 series but reducing iPhone Air orders at the same time.

A similar predicament is reportedly facing the iPhone Air's competitor, the Galaxy S26 Edge. Reports claim that Samsung has given up on the idea of a Galaxy S26 Edge because of weak sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge.

Is the iPhone Air a flop?

It seems Apple expected people to be more welcoming of the iPhone Air. However, weak initial demand doesn't mean the iPhone Air is doomed. At least not just yet.

There's something curious going on with the Air that I've noticed. The phone seems to be experiencing a bigger demand in China than in Western markets. Noticeably bigger.

This could partially be due to the newness of the iPhone Air; it's something different, and it's possible that some people are just not willing to risk it. While in China, there are plenty of innovative devices all the time, and I think this could be partially a reason why the Chinese market is more willing to welcome the Air.

On the other hand, it's a trend that Pro iPhones usually get quite a lot of sales in the first months after launch. Later on, the scales stabilize with other models getting some love by buyers as well.

So, I find that it's a bit early to label the iPhone Air as a complete failure. Things can shift. The phone is nevertheless a gorgeous device, in my opinion. I'd personally go for a Pro model just because of the superior battery life, but I'm hopeful the Air still gets its buyers, as it's one beautiful iPhone.

Revolut secures MiCA license in Cyprus to launch Europe-wide crypto services,"Revolut obtained a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), enabling it to offer regulated crypto services across all 30 markets in the European Economic Area (EEA).

The move boosts Revolut’s expansion in the crypto market as the fintech prepares to launch its next-generation “Crypto 2.0” platform, the company said in a news release shared with Cointelegraph.

“This authorisation enables us to deliver groundbreaking crypto products with enhanced transparency and trust for our growing customer base, while further reiterating our commitment to crypto as an asset class,” said Costas Michael, CEO of Revolut Digital Assets Europe.

The MiCA license allows Revolut to market its full suite of crypto products under the regulatory framework. The company, which serves more than 65 million customers worldwide, including 40 million in Europe, will use the license to expand its crypto trading, staking and stablecoin offerings, per the announcement.

Revolut’s Crypto 2.0 to offer 280 tokens

Revolut also unveiled a suite of new products, including its next-generation crypto platform, Crypto 2.0, which will include access to over 280 tokens, zero-fee staking with returns of up to 22% annual percentage yield and 1:1 stablecoin-to-US dollar conversion without spreads.

“When paired with crypto-enabled Revolut Visa/Mastercard cards, seamless on/off-ramping tools, and Revolut X’s low trading fees (0.00%–0.09%), the platform delivers one of the broadest and most cost-effective crypto experiences in Europe,” the company wrote.

Last year, Revolut introduced Revolut X, a dedicated desktop crypto exchange targeting experienced traders. The platform offers trading for 100 tokens with low fees and real-time on/off-ramp capabilities.

The firm later expanded its crypto exchange in Europe, rolling out Revolut X in 30 markets across the European Economic Area (EEA). The platform, which now supports mobile access via the App Store and Google Play, has attracted more than 14 million crypto users globally, Revlout said.

5 Quantum computing stocks surge as Trump eyes investment,"The Trump administration is reportedly exploring investments in several quantum computing companies in an effort to accelerate U.S. technological advancement. According to The Wall Street Journal, discussions have already taken place with a few notable players in the sector. If the move is finalized, it could mark a defining moment for America’s pursuit of leadership in next-generation computing.

1. D-Wave and IonQ among top companies in talks

Among the companies involved in preliminary discussions are D-Wave Quantum, IonQ, and Rigetti Computing, while Quantum Computing Inc. is also reportedly considering similar arrangements. Under the potential plan, these companies would receive government funding in exchange for the U.S. government becoming a shareholder. Although still under consideration, the proposal suggests Washington’s growing interest in deep-tech innovation.

This interest comes as these firms continue to face steep losses despite strong investor enthusiasm. D-Wave’s projected revenue for the year is less than $25 million, with an expected net loss of about $230 million. IonQ, the largest by market capitalization, is estimated to lose nearly $500 million on revenue of just over $90 million. Even so, market optimism remains high. D-Wave’s stock has tripled this year, Rigetti’s shares have more than doubled, and IonQ’s stock has climbed roughly 30%.

2. The science behind the technology

Quantum computing differs dramatically from classical computing. Instead of relying on binary code, quantum machines use qubits — units that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to handle complex computations far beyond the capacity of traditional processors.

By applying principles of quantum mechanics, these computers could one day solve intricate problems in fields such as chemistry, medicine, and climate modeling. This potential is a key reason why government leaders see the technology as strategically vital.

3. Why the U.S. is eager to invest

The global race for quantum supremacy is heating up. Analysts at BofA Securities previously described the technology as possibly “the greatest revolution since the discovery of fire,” emphasizing its potential to transform every sector of society. Their report also warned that whoever dominates quantum computing could secure massive geopolitical and economic advantages.

According to their estimates, global government funding for quantum technology has reached at least $42 billion, with China contributing more than a third of that total. This reality underscores why U.S. officials may see urgency in supporting domestic companies now rather than later.

4. A field of promise and challenge

Despite the excitement, the path to practical quantum computing remains difficult. Industry experts note that current machines are still “noisy,” meaning they struggle with interference that disrupts accurate calculations. This makes it hard to achieve what researchers call quantum advantage — demonstrating that a quantum computer can outperform a classical one on a real-world problem.

Even tech giants like NVIDIA have expressed cautious optimism. Earlier this year, the company’s CEO suggested it might take decades before fully operational quantum computers are commercially viable. Nonetheless, progress is steady, and research continues at an accelerating pace.

5. What government investment could mean

If the Trump administration proceeds with funding, it would mark a new stage in U.S. technological policy. The move would align with recent investments in companies linked to national security and strategic innovation, such as Intel and MP Materials. By becoming a shareholder in emerging quantum ventures, the government would not only back technological progress but also secure a stake in one of the most promising — and competitive — frontiers of science.

Such an initiative could also restore confidence in America’s leadership in advanced computing. With rapid developments happening worldwide, collaboration between public institutions and private innovators might be essential to keeping the U.S. ahead in the quantum race.

As investors, policymakers, and scientists watch closely, the next few months could determine whether quantum computing remains a speculative dream or becomes a strategic reality for the United States.

Shaping the Future of Hospitality Investment,"As the world’s leading minds in hospitality investment prepare to gather at Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai next week for Future Hospitality Summit – FHS World 2025, investors have shared their insights on the trends and strategies that are shaping the future of hospitality investment.

FHS World, widely recognised as the Middle East’s premier hospitality investment forum, will see 300+ investors in attendance with more than USD$ 5 trillion asset under management, 40 percent of them coming from non-GCC countries.

Together, these decision-makers span a wide spectrum of capital sources, from investment companies and family offices to sovereign funds, REITs, and private equity firms. Their presence at FHS World underscores a renewed appetite for investment, not just in established hubs like Dubai and Riyadh, but across Europe, the GCC, Asia, and North Africa, where destinations such as Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia are gaining momentum. Delegates will have access to unrivalled networking and deal-making opportunities, enabling direct engagement with investors all actively searching for the next wave of hospitality ventures.

Ahead of the event, top-tier investors have shared their views on the future of hospitality investment. With input from Fahad Al Alloush, CEO, Al Raya Real Estate; Mayra Andrea Mueller, President, Cipta Graha Group, Nabil Nazer, Chief Executive Officer, Mohamed Saeed Almulla & Sons / MSA Capital Limited, and Anthony Costa, Head of Hospitality & Lifestyle, Candy Capital.

Hospitality Capital in Transition: from Caution to Confidence

Across regions, the message is clear: capital is returning to hospitality, but with a sharper eye on selectivity, sustainability, and operational performance.

We are indeed seeing a shift from caution toward renewed confidence in hospitality investment. The resilience of travel demand, coupled with the industry’s adaptation to evolving consumer expectations—such as wellness, sustainability, and experiential offerings—is driving this momentum. Capital that was previously on the sidelines is re-entering the sector, albeit with a more selective and value-driven approach. Mayra Andrea Mueller, President, Cipta Graha Group

Anthony Costa, Head of Hospitality & Lifestyle, Candy Capital, agrees: We are indeed witnessing a notable shift in hospitality investment attitudes—from a period of cautious observation to a renewed sense of confidence. The past few years have tested the resilience of the sector, but what’s emerging now is a more agile, data-driven, and experience-focused investment mindset. Investors are increasingly drawn to assets that demonstrate adaptability, whether through tech integration, sustainable operations, or diversified revenue streams. Capital is flowing more freely into lifestyle brands, extended-stay models, and mixed-use developments that blend hospitality with residential and retail components. Looking ahead, we can expect a more nuanced approach to risk, with investors favoring flexibility and long-term value creation over short-term gains.

This evolution signals more than just a return of liquidity and points to a new mindset. Investors today are recalibrating their expectations, seeking measurable impact, operational efficiency, and brand authenticity rather than short-term gains or speculative development. In the Middle East, that shift is especially evident.

Investor sentiment in our region is definitely shifting from caution to confidence. We’re seeing renewed appetite for hospitality projects, especially in Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC. The fundamentals are strong—population growth, tourism spending, and major government-led initiatives are all supporting the sector. That said, investors are now more selective. They want clear visibility on returns, strong locations, and efficient operating models rather than just landmark developments. Fahad Al Alloush, CEO of Al Raya Real Estate

This new wave of capital discipline marks the maturing of a region that has emerged as one of the world’s most dynamic hospitality growth engines.

Growth with Intent: Selectivity, Sustainability, and Authenticity

As the sector expands, investors are targeting areas that combine financial resilience with long-term experiential value.

Mueller highlights that the most exciting areas of growth are luxury resorts that combine lifestyle, sustainability, and cultural authenticity, citing Dubai and Bali as prime examples of destinations where modern vibrancy meets sustainable, experience-led environments. She adds that branded residences, lifestyle hotels, and integrated hospitality concepts will remain core investment pillars, driven by digital guest engagement, technology-driven efficiencies, and sustainable operations.

Al Alloush sees the most exciting opportunities in serviced apartments and branded residences, especially in Saudi Arabia’s coastal destinations such as the Red Sea and Jeddah, alongside lifestyle midscale hotels that cater to domestic and regional travellers. Yet, he cautions that construction costs, delivery timelines, and the shortage of experienced operators who can balance international standards with local realities continue to challenge investors. Access to financing has also become tougher, so structuring deals with the right partners is key, he added.

Costa sees the most exciting areas of growth from an investor’s perspective in three areas: travel - properties that offer immersive, culturally rich experiences are commanding premium interest; tech-enabled operations - automation, AI, and smart infrastructure are not just operational tools—they’re becoming investment differentiators, and Sustainable and ESG-aligned assets - green-certified hotels and those with strong community engagement are increasingly attractive to institutional investors.

Nabil Nazer,Chief Executive Officer, Mohamed Saeed Almulla & Sons / MSA Capital Limited, also identifies a trifecta of opportunity: strong structural policy-driven demand, experiential gastronomy and entertainment, and branded residences and extended stay, balanced by cost, talent, and brand-delivery challenges.

Dubai overnight visitors continue to set new records, and the expansion of Al Maktoum International means that growth is effectively hard-wired for the next decade. Add to that the migration of global elite to Dubai and a growing resident population, and you essentially have solid demand drivers across all lifestyle offerings, which are sufficient to support and absorb the growing room supply, says Nazer. At the same time, he notes that construction and fit-out prices have gone up considerably and that investors should be cautious in their feasibility studies and adopt conservative ADR and occupancy assumptions.

On the human capital front, Nazer stresses that the fight for talent is intensifying and that finding the right talent is essential to success. Management and employee retention is crucial to ensuring success that is long-lived, and that means treating your employees as an asset, not an expense.

He also points to branded residence and extended-stay models as key growth engines that broaden fee income, deepen loyalty ecosystems, and enhance cashflows compared with pure residential or hotel developments.

Looking Ahead: Resilience, ESG, and the Road to 2026

As the global investment community convenes at FHS World, the tone is pragmatic yet positive. For investors like Mueller, the next growth phase will be defined by capital flows toward resilient destinations, sustainability and ESG alignment, and technology integration that personalises guest experiences and drives operational efficiencies.

Within sustainability, she notes, key certification standards are becoming increasingly important to validate practices and reassure both investors and customers. Key factors include resource conservation, sustainable sourcing, waste reduction, community engagement, and renewable energy adoption.

Al Alloush forecasts a focused but steady growth curve: Hospitality investment in 2026 and beyond will remain strong but focused. Saudi Arabia’s tourism targets will keep attracting capital, but the market will reward developers who build efficiently and operate smartly.

Collectively, these perspectives illustrate how hospitality investment is evolving from expansion to precision, anchored by fundamentals of authenticity, sustainability, and efficiency with hospitality no longer just about physical assets, but also cultural relevance, sustainability, and human experience.

As Costa summarised: the hospitality sector is entering a new era—one that rewards innovation, resilience, and purpose-driven growth. It’s an exciting time to be part of this transformation.

At a time when hospitality is redefining its value proposition, FHS World serves as the nexus for the industry’s most influential voices. The three-day conference agenda has a dedicated Investment and Real Estate content track with sessions covering a wide range of topics from “The Middle East Playbook: How to enter and succeed in hospitality investment, ‘Building Destinations Together: The impact of Public-Private Partnerships,’ and ‘Beyond The Peak: What the Numbers Say About the Next Chapter in Hospitality, to ‘Mapping the Money: Tracking Smart Capiotal in a Changing Hospitality Landscape, ‘The New Silk Road of Hospitality: Cross-Border Strategies in Global Investment,’ and ‘Investors with Influence: How Private Capital Shapes Hospitality Footprints,’ alongside many others.

A GrapheneOS phone is on its way: Should you wait or just buy a Google Pixel today?,"C. Scott Brown / Android Authority

I’ve introduced GrapheneOS to a lot of friends and acquaintances, and I often see a mix of excitement and hesitation. Not because GrapheneOS doesn’t deliver on its promises, but because it practically requires you to buy Google’s Pixel line of smartphones to use it. For an open-source project so laser-focused on delivering a private Android experience, the dependency on Google feels paradoxical.

There are good reasons for this, of course — Google is the only major phone maker that’s generous enough to let you install alternative operating systems. But luckily, that might not be the case for much longer. After years of being limited to just one hardware platform, the team behind GrapheneOS has confirmed they’re working with a “major Android OEM” to bake in official support for the operating system.

While we don’t have many details yet, we’re clearly on the cusp of the ultimate GrapheneOS phone. So with that in mind, should you buy a Google Pixel 10 series phone now, or wait for what might be the first device to list GrapheneOS support on the spec sheet? Here’s what I think as a long-time GrapheneOS proponent and user.

Is it worth buying a phone for GrapheneOS?

Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority

If you’ve never heard of GrapheneOS, you might be wondering what’s so special about it and why so many people base their smartphone buying decision based on its compatibility. Simply put, it’s a security and privacy-hardened fork of Android. You can replace the stock Pixel OS on modern Google phones with GrapheneOS with surprisingly little effort, and the list of benefits are plenty.

You see, Android phone makers need to bundle Google’s entire Play Services suite as part of an agreement with the search giant if they wish to include the Play Store. This is why we see apps like Chrome and Google Photos pre-installed on a Motorola or Xiaomi phone, but it doesn’t stop at those apps. The Google Play Services framework has deep, system-level access to your device, giving it unfettered access to sensitive data like location, network activity, and app usage.

The solution might seem simple: just get rid of it. But unlike other privacy-oriented Android forks, GrapheneOS doesn’t make your phone any less usable or convenient by stripping away features. Instead, it isolates and restricts Google’s system-level components while granting you greater control over various Android permissions. This means you can still access the Play Store and even banking apps, while limiting them from phoning home with your data in the background.

You don’t just gain intangible privacy benefits. My favorite GrapheneOS feature is storage scopes, which let you grant apps access only to specific folders or files. It helped me realize just how excessive and broad Android’s default permissions really are. Other features include per-app network toggles, the ability to block sensor access, and an optional duress PIN. You can configure GrapheneOS to be as private as you’d like, but even the baseline experience is a step above what most Android phones ship with by default.

Why a non-Pixel GrapheneOS phone is exciting, and why it isn’t

Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority

As I mentioned earlier, GrapheneOS’ compatibility list has been limited to Google’s Pixel line so far. And even though the latest Pixel 10 series isn’t supported yet, that will change within the next few months. However, it may also be the last Google device to get GrapheneOS, as the development team has stated that support for Pixel 11 and later hasn’t been decided yet.

Clearly then, the team’s focus is on the brand new vendor partnership that has now come to light. And based on what we’ve heard so far, it doesn’t seem to be a boutique or low-volume device either. The team says that they’re working with a major Android OEM on a future version of an existing smartphone and that it would be powered by a Snapdragon chip. GrapheneOS has a pretty long list of security requirements, so it rules out all but the flagship chip: the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.

The upcoming GrapheneOS phone will be powered by flagship Qualcomm silicon.

This is a very interesting point because Google’s latest Pixel 10 famously isn’t the fastest phone on the market — the Tensor G5 chip loses handily in benchmarks to flagship equivalents from Qualcomm and MediaTek. Many Pixel users are willing to overlook this in exchange for the software experiences built on the Tensor platform, but the latter doesn’t apply to GrapheneOS. In other words, GrapheneOS’ upcoming phone could unlock higher performance levels than what we’ll get from a Pixel in the near future.

Apart from that, we can make some educated guesses about GrapheneOS’ upcoming phone and how it might stack up to Google’s phones. It will likely cost at least as much as the base Pixel 10, given the flagship Snapdragon chip, and include similar internal specs. The partner brand in question might also be a smaller player in the space, given that Samsung hasn’t ever endorsed running alternative operating systems.

Having said that, the silver lining is that most Android brands have wider hardware distribution channels than Google. Since the Pixel is not available worldwide, those needing privacy the most (such as in oppressive regimes) are forced to import Pixel devices for GrapheneOS. Even smaller Android brands like Nothing have expanded rapidly, on the other hand, which could translate to greater accessibility.

GrapheneOS' partner manufacturer might not deliver seven years of software updates.

But hardware is only half the story. While there are certainly benefits to leaving the Pixel platform behind, GrapheneOS users might lose out in some areas too. For one, the team has stated that the phone in question will likely only receive five years of software updates. Without the size and resources that Google and Samsung have at their disposal, competing Android phone makers haven’t made a seven-year update pledge yet.

Moreover, I’m personally concerned about camera quality. While SoC-level image processing has improved over the years, the Pixel relies heavily on Google’s computational photography to deliver its excellent results. This is currently easily achieved on GrapheneOS by installing the Google Camera app, but it remains to be seen if the stock camera app will be supported on the upcoming phone. Whenever I replaced Xiaomi’s Android skin with a custom ROM, I always had to contend with reduced image quality as a consequence of the stock camera app being unsupported.

Should you wait for a GrapheneOS phone or buy a Pixel 10?

You shouldn’t wait if you’re expecting GrapheneOS to be an out-of-the-box experience. The team has clearly stated that they aren’t building a privacy phone from the ground up. Instead, it’s simply working with a manufacturer to meet GrapheneOS’ strict security requirements on a mass market phone. This means you’ll still have to manually install the operating system like you would on a Pixel today.

The good news is that installing GrapheneOS on a Pixel takes just a few clicks today. More importantly, the project supports all Pixel devices for as long as Google still releases security updates. This means support going back to the Pixel 6 but also continued support for the Pixel 10 until it reaches Google’s end of support period, ending in 2032. Of course, things could change but the GrapheneOS team said that it intends to maintain support for all existing models.

So if you buy a Pixel 10 now, you’re guaranteed years of official GrapheneOS support, and the installation process is about as painless as it will ever get. On the other hand, the upcoming GrapheneOS phone is still at least a year away with the team estimating a launch window of late 2026 or early 2027. In light of that, I think it’s hard to argue against the kind of stability that the Pixel 10 offers when the alternative is still so unknown.

World Diamond Council head says lab-grown gems losing their sparkle,"Lab-grown diamonds are losing their appeal due to oversupply and consumer preferences are starting to shift back to natural stones, World Diamond Council President Feriel Zerouki has said.

The natural diamond industry has seen a price slump since mid-2022 after peaking earlier that year, mainly due to the rising popularity of lab-grown gems especially among younger jewellery buyers.

But a collapse in lab-grown diamond prices on the back of increased production in China and India, has started to undermine confidence in the synthetic gems, Zerouki told Reuters in an interview at a mining conference in Luanda on Wednesday.

""If you look at the latest trends, lab-grown diamond prices are crashing. This is impacting consumer confidence in lab-growns,"" Zerouki said.

Diamond industry analyst Edahn Golan says the average wholesale price of one-carat and two-carat lab-grown diamonds has fallen by as much as 96% since 2018.

Experts have warned that the price of lab-grown diamonds could drop so low that they become fashion accessories that no longer compete with diamonds, especially in the key bridal market.

""I believe that the lab-grown bubble has burst. And actually, there is a movement in the trade, even at retail level, to come back to natural diamonds,"" she added.

Zerouki, who is also Vice President of Trading and Industry at global diamond giant De Beers, said a rebound in demand for natural stones would not happen by itself, but requires initiatives such as the Luanda Accord.

That is an agreement by diamond-producing countries and firms to create a collective marketing fund for natural diamonds.

Under the agreement, countries such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and South Africa have committed to allocate 1% of their annual diamond sales revenue to a campaign to promote natural diamonds.

"Splitit, DXC Bring Transactional Credit to Bank Debit Cards","The two companies announced a collaboration to integrate Splitit’s installment technology into DXC’s Hogan core banking platform, which supports more than 300 million accounts and $5 trillion in deposits across 40 major banks.

The integration will allow financial institutions to enable pay-over-time plans directly from debit cards and demand deposit accounts (DDAs) without creating new credit lines or third-party relationships.

Splitit CEO Nandan Sheth told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster that the partnership represents “one of the more important” steps in the company’s evolution, calling it “an opportunity that can scale” because Hogan powers 40 of the world’s largest banks. By embedding Splitit’s installment capabilities into the core system, he said, banks can “enable personalized installments directly to their debit card and DDA customers, fully embedded in their existing experience.”

Reclaiming Ground Lost to BNPL

The partnership aims squarely at helping banks compete with buy now, pay later (BNPL) providers that have gained traction with debit-first consumers. Sheth noted that “contemporary FinTech BNPLs are picking off debit consumers from the banks in the millions,” adding that debit represents “a significant opportunity” for financial institutions that have long struggled to monetize checking and debit portfolios.

By using Splitit’s technology, he said, banks can offer “transactional credit, not revolver credit,” in a way that is simple to consume and helps them “retain and hopefully grow their consumer base rather than see a hemorrhaging of that base.”

The model is designed to be flexible. Banks that wish to handle underwriting and origination can use Splitit purely as a technology layer. For smaller issuers, such as community banks and credit unions, Splitit can step in as a lending partner. “We can be a SaaS [software-as-a-service] provider that enables all the bits and bytes back to the core,” Sheth told Webster, “or we can do the underwriting and the extension of the loan back to the merchant.”

A Core-Level Advantage

The relationship began through a bank introduction. “One of our large bank partners said, ‘You should talk to our core banking provider,’ and they mentioned DXC,” Sheth recalled. “Once we got in there, we spoke to the C-Suite. They have a very progressive mindset, focused on innovation, transactional revenue and monetizing the assets they have. The timing was good.”

Integrating Splitit’s proprietary AI engine into Hogan will let banks personalize offers at checkout or even post-purchase, using behavioral and transactional data to optimize take-up rates. The goal, Sheth said, is to “create better conversion and stimulate the cardholders to pick up appropriate offers and not try to mass market to every single transaction.”

Splitit’s network already spans thousands of merchants, but Sheth emphasized that its reach through digital wallets and commerce platforms will be the real multiplier. “We’re embedded in the Samsung Wallet,” he said, adding that the wallet’s 30 million U.S. consumers and near-universal merchant acceptance make it a natural distribution channel. “The combination of our direct merchant network, platforms such as TikTok Shop, plus the wallets provides a level of acuity and scale that banks will benefit from.”

Those integrations also give banks new insights into customer spending, data Sheth said will stay strictly within each bank’s control. “Because we’re connecting to the core and going to have access to transactional data, the cross-marketing opportunities with the consumer and the bank are tremendous,” he said. “We’ll use the bank’s data to drive conversion and ensure that offers are very personalized.”

Fair Fees and Early Launch

Sheth believes the model brings fairness to a segment often criticized for high BNPL costs. “There’s going to be a sense of fairness in terms of the fees and APRs that are going to be charged by the banks,” he said. “Their cost of capital and understanding of risk are very different from third-party BNPLs, so the consumer will end up getting a better deal.”

Splitit and DXC have dedicated teams finalizing the integration, with a production-ready rollout expected in the first quarter of 2026 and three pilot banks lined up. “We feel very confident about launching at least two of the three by Q2,” Sheth said.

While the partnership will debut in the U.S., Sheth said interest extends well beyond. “We’re finding that debit card usage in the U.K. and Europe is getting stronger and stronger,” he said. “Being able to embed an installment credit vehicle on an existing DDA or debit card is very interesting for those banks because that consumer base wants transactional credit.”

In the end, Sheth believes this alignment of timing, technology and trust gives both banks and consumers what they’ve been missing. “The consumer will pay lower fees, the banks will earn new fee income on debit portfolios where growth has been anemic,” he said. “It’s a good cross-section of a segment that is large but underserved.”",pymnts.com,2025-10-23T11:00:39Z,https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2025/splitit-dxc-bring-transactional-credit-to-bank-debit-cards/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:34:55.151251
The Shades of Sasha Gordon,"Usually, I dislike surfaceless hyperrealism; to me, it’s an optical dead end. But 27-year-old Sasha Gordon’s new cycle of self-portraits at David Zwirner, “Haze,” is an exception. The star of the show is a seven-foot-tall painting called Pruning, in which Gordon is trapped in a Houdini-like tank of water, forced down by a faceless female. (Doubles proliferate in Gordon’s work — could the faceless torturer also be her?) Bubbles of air escape her mouth while her knees press against the aquarium glass until it cracks. The tank’s rusting iron frame doubles as metaphor: the strictures of gender and race that imprison her.

This is not identity politics gussied up for the market, not more virtue signaling. These canvases are too strange and slippery for that. The lighting is theatrical, colors lurid, bodies vivid. The eroticism is undeniable, never safe or consumable. Gordon weaponizes sexuality, turning it inside out until it disorients.

Born to a Polish American father and an immigrant Korean mother, Gordon has admitted, “I had a difficult relationship with my Asian identity,” adding that she often felt “disconnected from myself.” Growing up a queer Korean Jewish American in Westchester County produced a schism in which she was both fetishized and rendered invisible. In “Haze,” Gordon uses her body to stage a story about how identity is scripted and distorted — often by herself. Gordon plays all the roles — victim and villain, the stabbed and the stabber — laying bare how Asian women have internalized contradictory ideals: docile yet hypersexual.

She leans hard on horror and cinematic tropes of survival. In It Was Still Far Away, Gordon embodies the “final girl” — the resourceful lone survivor of slasher films and atomic fallout. A mushroom cloud behind her glows in radioactive orange-reds. But she seems coolly oblivious, clipping her toenails with her headphones on.

In Husbandry Heaven, her protagonist is force-fed by an antagonist with wrinkled waxen skin. Here, beauty becomes literal violence as her mouth is pried open, and nourishment becomes punishment. Women are trained to be quiet dolls, then punished when they falter. Gordon pushes these ideas to grotesque extremes, exposing the violence buried inside.

Whores in the Attic gives us Gordon peeping up at three towering Asian succubi who regard her with disdain. A Visitation amounts to a double self-portrait, a nearly nude helpless Gordon shoved into a chair by a great naked phantom banshee. In Husbandry, the forced feeding escalates with Gordon being overpowered by three giant Asian shades. In Petrified, a fight to the death unfolds on barren ground. Gordon is tethered by a pubic-hair leash, which extends from her vagina, and is dragged by one of her demon identities. (Gordon has a thing for stringy hair and nail clippings.)

Not every canvas lands. The horror conceit occasionally lapses into B-movie costume drama with antagonists that feel more pastiche than myth. Yet when she hits, she hits hard. She paints to free herself from fetishization and the suffocating standards of beauty. She risks melodrama because melodrama is horror’s native tongue. Better too much than too little. Better to scream than to whisper.",Vulture,2025-10-23T11:00:34Z,http://www.vulture.com/article/the-shades-of-sasha-gordon.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:34:59.749640
"Inside Washington’s crypto war – Senators, crypto CEOs clash over market structure bill","Key Takeaways

Who attended the meetings?

Executives from major crypto firms such as Coinbase, Ripple, Galaxy, Circle, and Solana Policy Institute joined lawmakers for the discussions.

What’s in the Senate’s version of the bill?

The draft seeks to define jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, introduce the term “ancillary assets,” and bring clarity to which digital assets are not securities.

In a significant move toward shaping U.S. digital asset regulation, Senate Democrats and Republicans wrapped up separate roundtable discussions this week centered on the long-debated Crypto Market Structure Bill.

Executives from Coinbase, Ripple, Galaxy, and Circle joined the talks to push for clear rules around digital assets.

Inside the closed-door talks

For context, the meeting followed the recent leak of a six-page draft proposal from Senate Democrats, which stirred backlash across the crypto community for its strict stance on decentralized finance (DeFi).

The proposal, which sought to empower the Treasury Department and other financial regulators to define when an entity “exercises control or sufficient influence,” was criticized by industry participants as a potential DeFi ban.

According to Eleanor Terrett, the discussion opened with brief introductions from industry leaders who largely shared broad expectations for the bill.

Senators reportedly cautioned crypto executives against aligning too closely with Republican lawmakers, expressing frustration over the leak and public disputes that had emerged in recent weeks.

Sen. Gallego (D-Ariz) told the crypto CEOs,

“I’m really f**king pissed about what happened last week. Don’t be an arm of the Republican Party. They used you all and your megaphones to f**k us.”

Does this bill appear to be approved anytime soon?

Yet, despite tensions, both Democrats and Republicans appeared committed to advancing the Crypto Market Structure Bill. In fact, with growing bipartisan engagement and mounting pressure, the bill appeared to be finalized by the legislation before year-end.

Democrats rejected any notion of “slow walking” the legislative process, emphasizing their intent to finalize the framework efficiently.

However, they also pointed out that Republicans continue to face internal disagreements over key provisions of the bill.

Lawmakers have issued a warning to industry representatives. They cautioned that any attempt to publicly undermine or politicize the negotiations could jeopardize progress. Such actions might also delay the bill’s passage even further.

Hiccups that raised eyebrows

Prominent industry leaders such as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, and Circle’s Dante Disparte participated in the recent discussions.

Yet, the absence of key figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren highlighted lingering ideological divides.

But, with figures like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer engaging directly, the latest round of meetings signaled a renewed determination to deliver long-awaited clarity for the U.S. crypto industry.",Ambcrypto.com,2025-10-23T11:00:32Z,https://ambcrypto.com/inside-washingtons-crypto-war-senators-crypto-ceos-clash-over-market-structure-bill/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:35:01.214029
Kraken Reports Q3 Revenue Surge To Nearly $650 Million Ahead Of Anticipated US IPO,"Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Ahead of one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) in the digital asset sector, US-based crypto exchange Kraken has reported record revenue for the third quarter (Q3) of the year.

New Kraken Exchange Milestones

In a statement released on Wednesday, Kraken revealed that its Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) reached $648.0 million, marking a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time high for the company.

Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) soared to $178.6 million, a 124% increase compared to the previous quarter, with margins rising by nine points to 27.6%.

Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter of the year, while assets on the platform grew by 34% to $59.3 billion. Kraken’s community continues to expand, with 5.2 million funded accounts reported at the end of the quarter.

These results come as Kraken prepares for its initial public offering potentially for next year. The company disclosed last month that it is in advanced discussions with a strategic investor to secure new funding at a revised valuation of approximately $20 billion.

A number of crypto firms, including, Gemini Space Station (GEMI), and Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), are pursuing US market debuts this year, buoyed by a more favorable regulatory environment under the pro-crypto Trump administration.

Such regulatory developments led to the Nasdaq debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) this year. Initial excitement surrounding their launches led to a considerable surge in their respective stocks.

Acquisition Strategy Pays Off

Kraken’s success is also supported by several acquisitions announced this year. Following the acquisition of NinjaTrader, Kraken has been expanding its derivatives offerings, with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, a 42% increase from the previous quarter.

Last week, Kraken also acquired Small Exchange, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), which enhances its direct market-access infrastructure in the US,

Looking ahead, Kraken emphasized that its Q3 2025 results not only reflect strong financial performance but also the company’s commitment to shaping systems that will define the future of finance. “We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve,” the statement noted.

Our goal is to connect our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones, and use cases. This system will enable clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere—instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed, and scale.

The Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer Is an Epic Splurge for Dough Enthusiasts,"Brought to you by a brand that's best known for pizza ovens, the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer is an absolute tank of a stand mixer whose key functionality is specific to dough. Not cookie dough, mind you. That's actually a batter. We're talking about pizza dough, bread dough -- anything where gluten needs to be seriously strong-armed into existence. As a stand mixer, it's a major investment, but if you're hoping to take your pizza or sourdough sensibilities to the next level, here's everything you need to know about the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer before you buy.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer at a glance

Style: Heavy-duty stand spiral mixer with rotating 7.3 Quart-capacity bowl and dough hook. Additional attachments include mixing paddle, whisk and breaker bar.

Dimensions: 13.5"" (H) x 9.9"" (W) x 17.2"" (D)

Watts: 650

Weight: 32 lbs

Price: $799

Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer operation

The Ooni Halo Pro is a spiral mixer, which typically means that the bowl rotates on a base while the dough hook or mixing paddle holds still. This is different from planetary mixers, where the hook or paddle do the rotating in the head of the mixer while the removable bowl remains stationary in the base. The Ooni Halo Pro does both, which is the key to its gluten-developing potential, manipulating and pulling dough from multiple angles while both elements rotate.

The head tilts backwards by gripping two levers on both sides near the front, and the dough hook is interchangeable with several other attachments: a mixing paddle with built-in scraper, as well as a wire whisk, should you choose to put the mixer to use for non-dough projects. The speed is changeable via a dial on top of the mixer. A digital display indicates a percentage of the highest available speed, which moves in 5% increments. The dial is also a start/stop button for both the motor and the timer. Smaller buttons near the front of the mixer allow you to toggle between setting the speed or setting the timer. Long-pressing the mixer speed button allows you to switch between speed percentage or RPM.

What I liked about the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer

The Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer feels like a professional-grade appliance, yet it operates completely intuitively and easily. While the size and heft of the box was intimidating, the mixer is essentially in two major pieces, including the bowl, with only attachments to contend with in order to get it operating. Its footprint isn't as demanding as its weight would imply, and I scarcely consulted the manual before I had sourdough starter and water churning away in the mixing bowl, according to a recipe provided on Ooni's website. The Lights underneath made me wonder how I ever lived without this feature before.

The bowl is giant, at 7.3 quarts. The recipe allowed for comfortable mixing of enough dough to make four boules. (I made one large boule and a reasonably successful pizza, with dough to spare.) Unlike many spiral mixers, the bowl is also detachable and locks into place. A hinged splash guard is included, which stays snugly on top of the bowl, making for easy access when the hinged pane is lifted, or also via a pour spout.

Sourdough and other bread doughs can necessitate a fussy process, but Ooni's controls allow for maximum fuss with minimal effort, given its nuanced speed control and built-in timer. (If OCD has previously prevented you from dabbling seriously in bread dough, now you can rejoice.) Even if you're making basic batter recipes, you're likely to find instructions such as ""beat at medium speed for 2 minutes,"" followed by the addition of more ingredients and another indication to beat for a certain amount of time. Having the digital timer at your fingertips while you preside over the mix is as high functioning as an appliance built for these kinds of instructions can get.

A breaker bar that can be installed into the head acts as the one stationary element, as both the bowl and the dough hook rotate, preventing the dough from creeping up the dough hook. At the end of the process, I had a glossy, springy dough that never required me to get my hands caked with it.

The whisk and paddle attachments operate accordingly, which is good, since owning this dough mixer should preclude the need for other appliances. Cleanup is also a relative breeze: the flat surface of the top and the flush surface underneath the head make for little opportunity for rogue flour to get stuck and are easily wiped down.

What I didn't like about the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer

Honestly, the truly hard sell of the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral is on its price. At nearly double the cost of a reliable stand mixer from KitchenAid, it's a luxury item that can really only be justified if you're really -- I mean, really -- serious about making bread or pizza dough, regularly. It's also really heavy -- 32 pounds of machine is what is evidently required to give it the necessary oomph to allow gluten to really stretch, but it's a pretty hefty machine to consider moving onto the countertop each time you want to use it.

While its look is industrial, it wouldn't be out of place in many contemporary kitchens. Offered in only two available colors, the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral is definitely substance over style, which isn't a bad thing. But there are plenty of reliable stand mixers on the market that give more options where aesthetics are concerned.

Final verdict on the Ooni Halo Pro Spiral Mixer

As someone who loves baking but hates to have her hands caked with dough, the Ooni Halo Pro was thrilling in its hands-off gluten development potential. Both intuitive and fun to use, it churned out spectacular results, even for an unpracticed bread baker. If you own (and frequently use) a pizza oven, or if you're actually committed to regular breadmaking, then this machine would be a worthy splurge to help you up your game. If the price isn't a barrier to entry, and you seriously aspire to be a regular bread baker, it might even help you to develop doughmaking game to begin with.",CNET,2025-10-23T11:00:04Z,https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/the-ooni-halo-pro-spiral-mixer-is-an-epic-splurge-for-dough-enthusiasts/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:35:13.629400
Trump Authorizes Strategic Reserve Refill as Oil Prices Dip,"It has been about six months since we last wrote about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

When President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a “national energy emergency,”’ he directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to prioritize refilling the SPR to its full capacity, which is approximately 714 million barrels.

At the time, the reserve held around 394 million barrels-about 55% of capacity-after historic drawdowns during the Biden administration. As a reminder, in April 2024, the Biden administration refused to purchase oil to refill its reserves.

Progress is beginning to be made in the wake of falling crude oil prices. Plans are being made to purchase 1 million barrels for the SPR.

The Energy Department announced Tuesday that it plans to buy oil for delivery in December and January, using a portion of the $171 million from President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law allotted for crude purchases.

“While this process won’t be complete overnight, these actions are an important step in strengthening our energy security and reversing the costly and irresponsible energy policies of the last administration,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, is down about 30% since its peak in mid-January. It traded at about $58 a barrel on Tuesday, near the lowest since 2021.

That makes it an ideal time to refill the reserve, which at 408 million bbls is only about 60% full. But the Energy Department only has $171 million to buy crude — or enough for roughly 3 million bbls, based on today’s price.

Reports indicate that supplies are exceeding demand, which is a good sign for those of us who appreciate inexpensive and efficient fuel sources.

The amount of crude on tankers at sea has risen to a record high, signaling that a long-anticipated surplus may have started to materialize, while time spreads are starting to signal ample supply. The International Energy Agency expects world oil inventories to exceed demand by almost 4 million barrels a day next year as OPEC+ and some countries outside the alliance ramp up output, likely in a bid to recapture market share.

“We’ve got supply growth running three times faster than demand growth,” Bob McNally, founder and president of Rapidan Energy Group, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “Near-term we have a glut.”

The DOE just issued a report that highlights measurable progress in cavern refurbishment and system testing related to the SPR infrastructure, with 95% of its essential drawdown capacity restored by 2025. However, the agency also warns that aging salt caverns remain a medium-term risk requiring sustained congressional funding through 2028 for complete modernization.

The Trump administration’s handling of the SPR will be a strong selling point in the next presidential election cycle for anyone on the team who cares to throw their hat in the ring.

The buyer persona gap that’s costing you customers and making your marketing less authentic [+ the fix],"Buyer personas are a foundational component of many brands’ marketing strategy. Personas often serve as a blueprint that guides marketing campaigns, customer journeys, and even product development.

Even though buyer personas are highly effective, they often miss the helpful context that marketers need to effectively serve the various identities their ideal customers possess. As a result, personas aren’t converting certain consumers at the rates that they could be.

In this post, I’ll share where traditional buyer personas miss the mark and how to fix it.

Table of Contents

The Gap in Most Buyer Personas

Consumer identities are often part of their decision-making process.

How to Make Your Buyer Personas More Effective

The Gap in Most Buyer Personas

As an inclusive marketing strategist and consultant, I work with my clients to audit various components of their customer experience. This often includes reviewing and providing feedback on their creative briefs as they work on creating campaigns. It also involves getting consumer feedback on what they make.

Whenever I flag materials that can be improved regarding consumers with specific identities, brands have included specific buyer personas in their creative brief.

However, the execution of the materials wasn’t as successful. That’s often because the personas lacked the depth of information about the various identities of the consumers that the brand wanted to reach.

And as a result, the corresponding campaigns often fail to effectively engage consumers who are part of underrepresented and underserved communities that also fit the buyer persona profile. That’s a missed opportunity. Getting it right makes buyers feel seen, supported, and like they belong.

Here are some examples of challenges that arise with personas that lack specificity. I should note that these are all complaints I’ve heard directly or seen consumers commenting on in various channels:

Magazine covers that don’t have plus-sized people featured.

General market ads that don’t feature any Hispanic consumers.

Website pages that don’t take into account accessibility features to support consumers with disabilities.

Ads that feature people from underrepresented and underserved communities but lack cultural intelligence elements. The messaging doesn’t speak to their needs or objectives.

Visual imagery that features people from underrepresented and underserved communities in a stereotypical way.

Consumer identities are often part of their decision-making process.

Every consumer has identities that influence what they buy and who they buy from, whether they know it or not.

For instance, I’m a Black woman. I’m left-handed. I follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons. My husband is a Spanish-speaking immigrant. And, together, we have a mixed-race bilingual child. As both a consumer and a business owner, at least one of these aspects of my identity influences what I buy in more instances than not.

For example, as a business owner, I often look for success stories from other business owners who “look like me.” After relocating to the U.S. from Buenos Aires, when we went to buy a car, my husband and I chose our salesperson based on whether or not they spoke Spanish. When I buy clothes, dolls, and toys for my daughter, I intentionally look for options where the images reflect girls who have curly hair and match her skin tone.

Other consumers don’t have the choice of considering their identity when it comes to making buying decisions. That’s because societal influences shape their experiences. How others respond to and/or engage with them is different. That’s especially true when compared to others who fit what has traditionally been considered the “mainstream.”

To illustrate, I worked with a client who had both service providers and the end consumers in their customer base. During research, we often heard from service providers that aspects of their identity (including race/ethnicity and gender) impacted the way they were treated while doing their work.

The service providers’ identities did not impact how well they were able to perform at their craft. But, their identities sometimes impacted the kinds of experiences they had with others. That wasn’t the case for people with identities that were part of the “mainstream”.

As consumers, our identities are a core part of who we are. Most consumers don’t compartmentalize or separate their identities when it comes to the buying process — even if marketers aren’t necessarily considering or infusing identity effectively into personas.

For buyers, their identity is so ingrained that they might not even realize how much it is a part of their decision-making process. And if marketers don’t ask about it during research, their identities may never come up as a point of consideration.

Therein lies the disconnect between many buyer personas and the consumers they are intended to represent.

Marketers must remember that the customers they serve are both consciously and unconsciously looking to answer this fundamental question when engaging with your brand: Is this product for someone like me?

That someone like me could be a variety of things:

A solopreneur.

Someone who isn’t tech savvy.

Someone who is neurodivergent.

Someone who speaks English as a second language.

A woman.

Someone with a bigger body frame.

Someone with textured hair.

Someone with kids.

Someone without kids.

Someone who is single.

Someone who is married.

Someone who practices Hinduism.

A gay male.

An immigrant.

Someone with a disability.

Someone who is 53.

And the list goes on and on.

If a consumer doesn’t feel like what you have to offer is for “someone like them,” they will move on to something or someone else.

Brands face a challenge: They must clearly and quickly communicate that their offering is for the specific identities of people who face the problem they solve. To meet this need, marketers need to call out those identities and acknowledge them in personas.

So even though a neurodivergent consumer fits one of your buyer persona categories to a tee, that doesn’t mean he will feel seen, supported, or like he belongs with your brand. That’s especially true if your personas don't mention any aspects of his identity.

How to Make Your Buyer Personas More Effective

One of the core tenets of customer acquisition is choosing the specific identities you want to serve as customers. By infusing those identities into your buyer personas, you’ll set your brand up with the foundation needed to effectively serve all the consumers you want to target.

There are two ways you can approach this.

1. Add identity layers within your personas.

This involves taking your existing personas and adding more of the identity-based context. The extra information will help marketers execute on campaigns.

It's always a good idea when data can inform the identity-based layers you want to include. So whatever data you can access about your ideal consumers from an identity standpoint, dig into it.

If you can’t access that data from your own internal or third-party data sources, consider sourcing this type of information from surveys, 1:1 interviews, or other direct engagements. That way, you can start to build the layers of the identities into your buyer persona profiles.

Once you have more specifics about what the identities are, be intentional about clearly and quickly communicating that what you have to offer is “for people like them” throughout your customer journey.

Here’s what adding in more identity-based information could look like for Creator Carmen.

These facts alone might be helpful to include in the narrative. But if a marketing team doesn’t know how being visually impaired, an Afro-Latina, or speaking English with a Spanish preference potentially influences Carmen, that information isn’t useful.

Marketers need to understand how identity factors impact these three versions of Creator Carmen’s decision-making process and buyer journey.

My recommendation is to infuse more nuanced information into your personas like this:

Then, supplement your identity-related challenges, frustrations, and wishes with supporting documentation. The extra information serves as a guidebook of what’s different about Creator Carmen’s experiences because of her disability versus a Creator Carmen who doesn’t have one. You can then show up well for the various versions of Creator Carmen you want to reach.

Customer interviews, focus groups, social listening, and other secondary sources can help you gain the cultural intelligence you need about identity.

2. Build identity-specific personas.

You might find that there are times when having a buyer persona specific to certain identities is helpful. However, the success of a persona depends on what your suite of buyer personas looks like or how they’re categorized.

This works well in the instances where it’s necessary to create specific products, features, communications, experiences, and even core messaging.

For instance, let's say one of your product offers includes a customer segment of children under the age of 18. The needs, experiences, expectations, and ethics associated with how a brand communicates with them would be sufficiently different. With these constraints, it could be harder to make personas with identity-specific layers.

Here’s another example for you. In this video, email marketing strategist Eman Ismail explains how her Muslim faith identity has impacted her experiences at business events. Brands that host any kind of event and want to create a space where Muslim attendees feel seen, supported, and like they belong could benefit from creating a separate identity-specific persona.

You can listen to my entire conversation with Eman here on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast.

It’s time to make your personas more effective.

Buyer personas are powerful, but only when you create them to operate at their full potential. Move beyond traditional buyer personas to incorporate important elements of identity that your ideal customers are using to make buying decisions.

How Marriott’s commitment to ‘career acceleration’ elevates women leaders,"Half (51%) of the executive positions (vice president and above) in the U.S. are women. Globally, it’s 48%. Women also make up nearly half of the board and 50% of CEO Tony Capuano’s direct reports.

That’s in stark contrast with the market average.

Per McKinsey’s 2024 “Women in the Workplace” report, women hold just 29% of C-suite roles and 34% of vice president positions. The Conference Board found that women accounted for only 29% of board seats at the Russell 3000 as of 2024.

Something different is happening at Marriott, an honoree on this year’s Fortune Best Workplaces for Women™ List.

“It’s not just about the representation of those people in the senior leadership roles; it is also how do they help you navigate getting there,” says Frid Edmond, senior vice president of customer engagement at Marriott and incoming executive sponsor of the Women’s Associate Resource Group (ARG).

That’s why career development conversations play such a crucial role. At Marriott, leaders are expected to regularly talk to their direct reports, as part of their annual performance review cycle, about their career aspirations and how they can achieve their goals. Within these conversations, a subtle shift has been a game-changer — what Edmond describes as a move from mentorship to “career acceleration.”

Before, mentors would keep an eye out for opportunities, and if the stars aligned, they were expected to help associates take the next step in their careers. Leaders have a new expectation: “Tell us what you want, and we are holding ourselves accountable to helping you to get there.”

This shift can be seen in examples from Edmond’s own career, including one indelible career conversation with a supervisor five years ago.

“I was required to come up with three roles that I could see myself in within the next three to five years,” she says. “There was never a promise that these roles would come into play, but it was the art of possibilities, for me, where I saw myself.”

It’s an exercise she now repeats with her own direct reports, and a key ingredient in Marriott’s culture of access to opportunity. “We are required at every single level within our organization to ensure that we are developing the leaders of the future,” she says.

As a result, associates at Marriott are having a much better experience than those at a typical U.S. company.

Associate resource groups

The Women’s ARG at Marriot, which is open to all associates, supports its 5,500 members by offering mentorship and educational support around topics from financial wellness to executive presence, and mock job interview practice. The group also works collaboratively with other resource groups in the organization, highlighting support for all associates, including military veterans, neurodivergent employees, and working parents.

Allies in the group play an important role in mentorship and sponsorship, Edmond says.

“The majority of my mentors have been men, if I’m totally honest,” she shared. But they were invested in her growth and had the authority in key moments to help guide her. What happened when she made her first presentation to the board? “Our chief legal counsel member, as well as our chief communications and PR lead, sat across from me during the board presentation and gave me simple eye cues,” she says.

Just having their presence was a big vote of confidence, Edmond adds. “I can’t tell you what that means to me to know that these two individuals were that invested in my first time presenting to the board to make sure that I was set up for success.”

Tips for building better workplaces in 2025

For organizations that want to be more like Marriott, Edmond offers a few pointers.

Invest in associates at every level of the organization

How you invest in associates at lower levels of the org chart eventually impacts results at the top. Edmond, for example, started as an hourly employee and over a 22-year career has held seven different roles in the company.

“You don’t just jump from an hourly employee to an SVP,” she says. Inclusion requires a system of support across every level in the organization.

Make time for development conversations all year round.

Candid development conversations won’t happen if you only discuss them as an afterthought or in response to an annual employee engagement survey. Your approach to development has to be continuous and thoughtful, Edmond says.

Celebrate everyday accomplishments, including failure.

Growth for all associates requires the permission to try new things, take on stretch assignments and sometimes fail. “When we fail, we celebrate that, too,” Edmond says.

Send a clear signal on inclusion from top leaders.

When Marriott’s CEO Tony Capuano reaffirmed Marriott’s commitment to welcoming all, the message had a direct impact on employees.

“Tony was asked some really tough questions at the beginning of the year,” Edmond says. “We were waiting to see how he responded — and he responded the way that we needed.”

The message has empowered Marriott associates to continue to engage. “We start from a place of welcoming all,” Edmond says. “No matter what is going on in the environment, we are always going to welcome all.”

Don’t Mistake a Miracle for Its Cause,"In times of crisis, we consider what can be done to return to a path of prosperity and wealth. However, there is a tendency to mistake the previous manifestations of economic success—the sectors and products that an economy has, in the past, successfully produced—for the more fundamental source of success.

When, in 1947, Ludwig Erhard lifted price regulations and decisively shifted the German economic system away from heavy interventionism towards a free market economy, the stage was set for what is commonly—though perhaps misleadingly—referred to as the “German Economic Miracle.” The rest is history.

Today, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the origins of wealth that endangers the already struggling German economy’s future. This misunderstanding is also observable in other societies. The mistake is taking the really-existing businesses and sectors that have emerged under a successful economic system to be the decisive element in an economy’s growth. For example, Germany’s economic system has produced an economy focused on, put very roughly (and, strictly speaking, of course, falsely), cars. So, one may conclude that all that is necessary for protecting and reinvigorating the German economy is to protect and support the German carmakers’ ability to produce cars. Precisely this is what many commentators on the German economic situation, as well as politicians, seem to believe. According to this view, the focus must be on ensuring favorable conditions for the auto sector, a proven powerhouse of the economy in the past.

This is not necessarily false—but if it is correct, it is correct contingently, not necessarily. Consider that a system of free enterprise will lead to the production of certain goods and services, and those may well lead to a focus on cars. But it could also lead to specialization in another industry, or to more diverse economic activity.

The goods and services that entrepreneurs focus on are not given or predetermined. Rather, in a free market, entrepreneurs who can produce profitably will succeed, regardless of the industry they operate in. It may well be that carmakers are exceptionally profitable. But the success of carmakers, or any other industry for that matter, is only worth celebrating when it is a manifestation of the healthy market economy.

So, what’s the lesson? It is that not industrial production, nor cars, nor any other sector was the decisive element for Germany’s economic success. These are just specific manifestations of that economy in this specific time and place. What the economy needs is a system that ensures market-tested success, not the prospering of any particular industry.

Instead, the decisive factor is the economic system, where entrepreneurs must be free to flourish while also being responsible for their actions. In other words, the free market is crucial—and, historically, it was the reason for the tremendous economic growth Germany experienced. In any economy’s past, this economic success will have manifested in certain sectors being central to the economy; tomorrow, it may be precisely these sectors again, but it could also involve completely different ones.

To retain—and in Germany’s case, regain—its economic clout, a society’s focus must be on its economic system, not on the sectors that have historically emerged as the strongest under that system. Put simply, what is required is a return to the free market, not the bolstering of one specific sector that has recently achieved success.

Now, let me be clear that there are certainly measures that would not only promote the specific sector that has historically brought success, such as the automotive sector in Germany, but also represent a return to free market principles. Consider deregulation and lowering corporate income taxes. However, the focus must always be on the market if the objective is to rekindle the economy, rather than on any specific sector that seems promising to politicians, such as subsidizing energy prices for industry.

This misunderstanding of what constitutes economic success permeates not only German policy recommendations but also those of many other countries. To some extent, it is understandable as the success of an economy manifests, or at least is primarily visible, in specific industries. However, this is precisely to misunderstand the true origins of a society’s economic miracle. You do not enrich your citizens by protecting an industry that has been successful in the past. Rather, at the basis of economic growth we find a solid market economy—just what Ludwig Erhard had restored in 1947 when he eliminated a host of government interventions to free the citizens from the constraints that had prevented them from enriching themselves and others.",Econlib.org,2025-10-23T11:00:00Z,https://www.econlib.org/econlog/dont-mistake-a-miracle-for-its-cause/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 19:35:35.359580
U.S. Rare Earth Company Signs Strategic Deal With Japanese Government,"Amid a global race to secure critical minerals outside China’s control, U.S. rare earth developer REAlloys Inc. has forged a strategic alliance with Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), the government agency under Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) charged with safeguarding the nation’s industrial supply chains.

The agreement, outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), sets out a framework for joint development, technology transfer, and industrial-security cooperation, according to Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX), which is currently in the process of merging with REalloys.

The pact marks JOGMEC’s first formal engagement with an American rare earth producer. It also signals closer alignment between Washington and Tokyo on resource independence. Both governments have identified rare earths and advanced magnets as essential for defense, energy, and semiconductor supply chains that are increasingly exposed to Chinese dominance.

JOGMEC has been one of the world’s most active catalysts for diversification, financing projects from Australia to Africa to lessen market concentration. The REAlloys partnership extends that effort to North America’s resource base and manufacturing capacity.

Focused Collaboration on Advanced Magnet Supply

Under the MoU, JOGMEC, acting on behalf of METI, will facilitate the licensing and transfer of Japanese separation and magnet-fabrication technologies to REAlloys’ North American facilities. The initiative targets the rapid scale-up of high-performance magnets such as neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) and samarium-cobalt (SmCo), which are materials central to defense systems, EVs, and chip manufacturing.

Both sides will also examine JOGMEC-supported financing for REAlloys’ vertically integrated supply chain, which includes upstream mining assets in Saskatchewan, a midstream separation complex in Saskatoon, and planned downstream magnet production in Ohio.

Leonard Sternheim, REalloys’ chief executive, said the collaboration unites two complementary strengths.

“Japan brings unparalleled magnet and processing technology; North America brings scale and resources,” he said. “Together, we are accelerating regional self-sufficiency in critical materials.”

Structured Access and Allied Security

The agreement provides for structured offtake arrangements guaranteeing reliable long-term supply of rare earth alloys and magnets to Japanese manufacturers. In return, REAlloys will dedicate part of its scandium and yttrium output from Hoidas Lake and secondary monazite sources to Japan, while maintaining its supply to U.S. defense and energy programs.

Hiroshi Kubota, executive vice president of JOGMEC, described the accord as a model for allied resilience.

“This partnership strengthens the foundation of economic security among trusted partners,” Kubota said. “By linking Japan’s technology and North America’s resources, we enhance global supply stability for materials essential to the future economy.”

The collaboration takes shape amid intensifying global competition for strategic minerals and renewed pressure to diversify away from China, which continues to dominate more than 80 percent of global rare earth refining and magnet production. Beijing’s 2023 and 2024 export restrictions on gallium, germanium, and rare earth processing technology have heightened supply insecurity across allied economies, accelerating government-backed efforts in both Washington and Tokyo to localize production.

Within this environment, the REalloys-JOGMEC partnership stands as a coordinated industrial response, linking Japan’s processing expertise and the United States’ raw resource base to build a secure, transparent alternative supply chain. Both sides said the agreement also opens the door to further cooperation, including the application of JOGMEC’s seabed resource technologies and new joint-research initiatives focused on long-term industrial resilience and allied strategic autonomy.

Other Companies Making Moves in the Critical Resources Race

Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE) is one of the world's largest diversified mining companies, with a core business in iron ore, but it is also a significant global producer of key battery metals, notably nickel and copper. As a massive, established producer of these base metals, Vale's output naturally includes byproducts like cobalt, which is often found in nickel ores. The company's operations span several continents, making it a pivotal supplier to global industrial and clean energy sectors.

The company's immense scale in nickel production is its most critical contribution to the energy transition, as nickel is a high-demand component in many electric vehicle battery chemistries. Vale is actively positioning its high-quality nickel as a preferred source for the electric vehicle supply chain, aiming to meet the strict environmental and traceability standards required by Western automakers.

Vale is currently focused on enhancing and expanding its high-grade nickel and copper assets, particularly in Canada and Brazil. It continues to refine its business to meet the specific requirements of the battery market, including investments in downstream processing capabilities to convert raw nickel materials into the high-purity sulfates required by battery cathode manufacturers.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) is the leading U.S. producer of uranium, but in a strategic pivot, it has leveraged its unique White Mesa Mill in Utah—the only conventional uranium mill in the country—to become a key player in domestic rare earth element (REE) processing. The company processes monazite sand, a feedstock containing REEs like NdPr, positioning it as an emerging, high-potential participant in the rare earth supply chain.

The company’s critical role lies in addressing the processing bottleneck that has historically crippled the U.S. rare earth sector. While some mining occurs domestically, the necessary chemical separation and purification of REEs has been almost entirely controlled by foreign entities. By producing a mixed rare earth carbonate at White Mesa, Energy Fuels is recreating a vital midstream capability in the U.S., a national security imperative.

Energy Fuels is now in the final stages of a major initiative to upgrade its White Mesa Mill to produce separated rare earth oxides, moving further up the value chain.
