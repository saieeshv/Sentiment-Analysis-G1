AAPL,1nwif2h,wallstreetbets,$GOOGL getting ready to enter PC and operating software space to compete $MSFT $AAPL,Think this isn't getting enough views. Appears that $GOOGL $GOOG will be entering the P/C/Laptop world with a Operating system based on Android that allows for Apps to be downloaded directly onto the PC. Think this was much needed and will help break the monopoly that Microsoft has. I current have to pay $70 for personal Microsoft office products (word/excel). I stopped paying last year and have since used Google office products which have been free and seen no issues. Would love to see more Google apps available more easily on the home screen. Not a easy task going against Microsoft - but lets see how it plays out. They did this with Chromebook in 2011 and made it the biggest laptops for education in the world. A gamble that paid off.,1303,209,2025-10-02 22:41:07,https://www.theverge.com/news/784381/qualcomm-ceo-seen-googles-android-pc-merger-incredible,2025-10-25 07:45:32.883258,1.0,$AAPL,1.0,"['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'GOOG']",[],0.9999999999999999,Technology

I've done just find not holding these names and I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same position. If so what have you done to keep up?

AAPL,1nwywg5,investing,What are your thoughts on NTLA or NVDA,"I’m 24 and learning this shit on my own, don’t come for me. Ok so, I put $300 on AEO a couple months back and had a 36.93% growth. Took my money out because it started going down and I was just testing something so didn’t want to wait for the possibility of it going up again during the holiday season. Just messing around and reading about some light day trading, so thought about buying a couple shares of those two NTLA and/or NVDA with that AEO money. Read a few articles and checked the price charts, both seem pretty good based on my bare minimum knowledge about investing. I’m also NVDA for risky and maybe AAPL that’s on a slightly safer side. Any advice? fyi I also invest on VTI through my traditional brokerage account and VOO+VXUS through my Roth IRA. Of course I never touch any of it, only add more money whenever I can",0,11,2025-10-03 13:17:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nwywg5/what_are_your_thoughts_on_ntla_or_nvda/,2025-10-25 07:46:13.036842,0.5,$AAPL,0.8,[],[],0.7,Technology

AAPL,1o0vi80,stocks,LIONSGATE Studios Update,"Full Disclosure: I currently hold 775,000 shares of $LION #LIONSGATE Lionsgate Studios Post Split from $STRZ Starz. I am creating this follow-up post thanks to the many people who have direct messaged me and also followed-up on my prior post/thesis. We have seen Lionsgate move over 30% up/sideways/down over the past 12 weeks. I have not moved my position as the longer term prospect thesis remains exactly the same. There is IP, a library, and revenue that single handedly will add immense value, beyond the current market cap, to any of the major players, i.e. $SONY $NFLX $PSKY $AAPL and the list goes on. Following near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst. We have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION. Conversations ARE happening and NEWS will come. I'll stop at 1 million shares and hold until a transaction takes place.

AAPL,1o39e0q,ValueInvesting,"Days like today are a reminder that AMZN is not on the same level as MSFT, NVDA, GOOG, AAPL, and META","I always see AMZN touted as a no brainer MAG 7 stock, but days like today are a friendly reminder that they are not in fact a pure software/high margin tech play as it goes without saying their large expensive retail enterprise is a massive part of the company you're buying. For better or for worse. That isn't to say AMZN is a bad company to own, but rather their business model is so vastly different than the others. And look I get AWS is a gem of a business, but as long as AWS is tied to the hip with a bloated retail enterprise, I will continue to invest elsewhere for cloud technology. I would not be shocked at all if AWS splits from AMZN if the company continues to tread water valuation wise for the next few years.",0,37,2025-10-10 18:46:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1o39e0q/days_like_today_are_a_reminder_that_amzn_is_not/,2025-10-25 07:46:31.599429,0.35,$AAPL,0.6,[],['split'],0.7057142857142856,Technology
