1nptl01,wallstreetbets,This stock is NEXT - DD,"Winter is coming‚Ä¶ and I think this one is NEXT, positions last pic

I know this position is risky, I might roll but this is why I‚Äôm here:

The idea is simple: insiders are loading up right as the company locks in real LNG growth and heads into winter. In the last week directors filed multiple open-market buys: William Vrattos purchased 100,000 shares at a weighted average $6.864, Edward Andrew Scoggins Jr. bought 15,000 shares around $6.46, and a separate Form 4 shows director Jason Dillow‚Äôs purchase disclosed on Sept 18‚Äì19. These are actual ‚ÄúP‚Äù code buys, not grants, and total seven figures of fresh skin in the game.

Why now matters. On Sept 9 NextDecade reached positive FID and financial close on Rio Grande LNG Train 4, and management guided that Train 5‚Äôs FID is expected before Nov 15 after recently signing a 1.5 MTPA, 20 year SPA with EQT for Train 5 volumes. Winter gas demand historically tightens the LNG tape, and sector prints like Sempra‚Äôs Port Arthur Phase 2 FID this week underscore that U.S. LNG build-out is still accelerating into year end.

The setup is that real project de-risking plus visible commercial deals plus unusually large insider buying can force a rerate from distressed expectations. With shares around the mid-$7s today, the near-term upside case is straightforward: Train 5 financing headlines or additional SPAs into winter could be the next leg while insider conviction anchors the floor. Size it like a volatile mid-cap LNG developer and respect headline risk, but the combination of fresh director money, new FIDs, and contracted volumes is exactly the kind of catalyst stack that can keep propelling this higher.",25,35,2025-09-25 01:10:46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nptl01,2025-09-25 02:29:34.882867

1npru94,wallstreetbets,"Is Gold Overbought Or Is There Still More Upside Left? Here's Our
Simple Technical Analysis and Thoughts.","Gold is now at $3760ish at the time of this post and holding, but is the momentum going to continue, or will we see a pause in the price movement upwards? Having been a Precious Metals Analyst since 2005, here are my thoughts...

I think this recent bull market in gold started once it cleared $2100 and broke out to the upside, which happened in March of 2024, mostly from Central Bank buying and investor demand. Since then, it's been on a gradual ascent upwards with some pauses and consolidations before making the next leg higher. At the beginning of this year, the US started bringing lots of gold from London (LBMA) and shipping it to the US, let's say at a price of about $2800-$3000. This is something I haven't seen in 20 years, so I think that puts a floor on the price of Gold at $3000, I don't think we will ever see gold under $3000 ever again, unless we get a MAJOR BlackSwan event and total all markets liquidation, and even then, that $3000 price of gold could hold as the floor.

So, currently at $3750, can gold continue higher to $4000? Yes, I think so. The rate drop cycle that has started in the US is one of the factors that caused gold to break out of the $3300-$3400 consolidation price range this summer. If we get more interest rate drops, I think Gold goes to $4000, based on this alone, but how much further it goes beyond that is yet to be seen. I would be happy with $4000 on gold in the next few months, or maybe into early next year.

There is a seasonality to gold price movements, but since the beginning of 2024, it hasn't followed the normal patterns, and I think that's because this new bull market started then, and probably has many more years ahead of us. But once the interest rate drop cycle ends, gold will have peaked out and may retrace back to major uptrend support lines, and consolidate for the next major move, up or down.

These are just some of my initial thoughts, and I will continue to pop in on this REDDIT once and awhile to share more thoughts and updates if people here are interested.",0,28,2025-09-24 23:48:15,https://i.redd.it/dlg1dqxx87rf1.png,2025-09-25 02:29:34.882875

1npr2f1,wallstreetbets,Alcohol Consumption Down,"Everyone has heard that all of the alcohol stocks are down due to a significant drop in consumption. We have heard a bunch of reasons why, like healthy lifestyle changes, the cost, and GenZ not really being into it. That may all be true, but I wonder if GLP-1‚Äôs have played a significant role. With the rise of GLP-1 drugs, there have been studies suggesting it could be used for alcoholics, significantly reducing their cravings. Alcoholics do some serious heavy lifting in terms of alcohol consumption. Some studies say 10% of drinkers consume 60% of the alcohol, which is insane. Odds are that if you are a heavy drinker, you are more than likely overweight and would be more interested in GLP-1 drugs. So if there is any truth to GLP-1s reducing alcohol cravings and a significant portion of that 10% is using it, then that should have a significant impact on the decline in consumption.",371,325,2025-09-24 23:12:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1npr2f1/alcohol_consumption_down/,2025-09-25 02:29:34.882894

1npnj6l,wallstreetbets,NVTS Navitas Semiconductor Run Incoming (NVDA Blackwell),"I‚Äôm picking NVTS for AI and Data Center Expansion. Basically this is a company specializing in next-generation power semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies. These are used in high-growth areas like AI data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), mobile charging, and renewable energy.

‚Ä¢  NVTS eyeing revival through NVIDIA AI synergies‚Äîvolume‚Äôs solid, but P/E flags caution. Buybacks could turbocharge if fundamentals align; divested $100M+ last year signals pivot potential.

‚Ä¢  Risk-reward tightening.. Upside from scale-ups and partnerships; downside on costs/delays.

‚Ä¢  Pre-market buzz tied to EV/AI tailwinds‚Äîpartnership expansions and earnings guidance in focus.

‚Ä¢  Shares breaking 50-day MA on volume‚Äîtechnical setup for extension if momentum holds.

‚Ä¢  Despite revenue dip, EV/semi growth narrative intact‚Äîoptimism hinges on delivery.

Not financial advice, DYOR, but if AI infrastructure bottlenecks persist (hello, NVIDIA Blackwell), NVTS could be the under-the-radar winner. At the current price, I‚Äôd say the room to run is to $16 after $9 breaks. We saw this on APLD. This narrative is the play.

Q3 earnings Nov 3 could spotlight AI progress; ECCE and WiPDA conferences in Oct/Nov for tech showcases; CES 2026 prep might drop EV bombshells via VREMT.

1npjlwc,wallstreetbets,$GAP - Yolo,"NFA, DYOR.

A few people posted DD on this. I didn't do it myself - credit goes to these guys

I read this DD (primary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nkow7c/gapping_up/)

TLDR of the DD: Super successful ad campaign (similar to how AEO used sydney sweeney) - but GAPs is looking much more successful. IE: Youtube ads have 3x the number of views in a shorter period of time compared to the sweeney ads & GAPs ads have also been insanely successful on tik tok - generating hundreds of millions of impressions. They went totally viral with the younger generation, with many people reposting videos / replicating the dances. Inventory was sold out across the board everywhere the original DD guy looked when the DD was posted (6 days ago)

\---

As well as this one (secondary one): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american\_eagles\_earnings\_blowout\_is\_bullish\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n8annm/american_eagles_earnings_blowout_is_bullish_for/)

TLDR of the DD: Similar catalyst for GAP as AEO.

\---

This only came to my attention as 2 guys in my dm's mentioned it to me & I've heard of GAP before (founded in the 1960s) so took a look. I did some very high level due diligence on, they might be right (but we won't know for months)

My DD looked at a few things. Price: It's currently trading lower than when both those DD's were posted (it's on a 3 week dip). They were all bullish (ie: good sentiment) -- I can't evaluate this one well tho due to small sample size. Chatted with a few people about it in my dm's, overall unsure how this one plays. Seems everyone had the same thesis tho. I bought these calls this morning after doing \~30 minutes of my own DD. It looks like it's been consolidating for months. The DD I read looks real (ie: those posts didn't look to be bots to me). It doesn't look to have bots pumping it either. I missed AEO + impact of social media (Sweeney really did carry them) so I checked google trends. Yes - the trends / searches & this one actually did jump on this ad campaign, similar to how AEO did. Compounded with the school season timing, this could do well. It has already run a bit in the last few months -- so things could also be priced in. We won't know until ER's tho -- which is in November. I also am aware not near as many people here are aware of the ad campaign (ie: I wasn't). I validated it was real myself tho. I didn't see too many people talking about it here / in the daily / etc - I only became aware as some guys in my dm's dropped me the dd and asked for thoughts. One of the times my play comes thru dm's / other places than the daily. Just like things like $SNAP tho - just because you think it's dead, doesn't mean it is. See the 1st linked DD for tik tok impressions - it's over 100 million views on just one video. Their youtube ad has over 3x the number of impressions as the AEO ad did.

I bought 4 months of time. I picked these strikes and expirations for risk management (sufficient time for the next ER's + a little buffer room). If the thesis is true, it'll shoot past 25. If false - probably sideways (and I eat theta decay). As with all my other plays - 4 months of time doesn't imply I'll be holding for 4 months.

Current P/E is 9.8, and IV is super low so calls are cheap imo. They have a solid dividend too + been around long enough that they're not going anywhere so shares are also an alright bet imo. Payoff of these calls is \~5:1 if they hit the PT's defined in the DD post, and downside is \~50% loss assuming they decay and we just go sideways. IE: Positive EV with an expected \~2.5:1 payoff. Shares may have a \~50% upside, ie: \~1.5:1 payoff. Since not many people have been discussing this one - I haven't been able to quantify risks well. I bought calls due to higher EV & the nature of my high risk investing. I'm either early or wrong, only time will tell.

Bought 100 contracts 130C on 8/12/24 with 12/19/25 Expiry. Sold before today‚Äôs pop :( and they‚Äôre worth $52ish last I checked but whatever.

Honestly I wish I never found this sub, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I didn‚Äôt file the 3k loss on my taxes. I just kept putting money into random options while scouring this sub.

At the worst point I had lost 120k of my own hard earned money. Throughout the years I had made the money back through some crazy WSB plays (GymeStonk, Iron net, etc) and within a couple days I‚Äôd be back to a huge loss. 

I finally started looking for value plays with LEAPS and my biggest option play were these BABA calls. I bought them with a year and a half DTE with half of my account value. For some reason I wanted to hold for at least a year because I had a feeling and here we are. It was hard to stomach the ups and down constantly but it paid off.
I think I‚Äôm done for a long time, I keep checking Robinhood for my next play out of habit but I think I‚Äôm going to delete the app after withdrawing it all. I put most of my BP in SGOV for now for dividends.

My advice: If you‚Äôre young and naive and lurking in this sub, don‚Äôt start trading options, I honestly got lucky. Maybe use a small percentage of your income for risky plays but not your entire investing budget like I did.

1np7c9f,wallstreetbets,$RKLB is the next best thing,"What‚Äôs up gang 

My [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/PxeU66W1DO) essay aged pretty well and I think this one too will also age pretty well 

Since I posted my last bullish thesis some crazy stuff happened, notably the DoD discovered that they couldn‚Äôt solely rely on SpaceX and Elmo because when he‚Äôs on his periods dude just goes  nuts üå∞

This fact alone serves as an insurance policy for Neutron‚Äôs future, ensuring it becomes instantly essential for the DoD

But if this is not enough here is a list of catalysts coming Rocket Lab way by end of year, 

Possible wins over contracts : 

- SDA (different layers) worth $500M+
- Mars Telecom Orbiter worth $700M 
- Mars Sample Return worth $4B 
- Golden Dome contracts (total project will be $175B+) 

Company catalysts : 

- Neutron on the pad 
- New Neutron commercial contracts 
- Neutron launch 
- EBITDA > 0 

Neutron is a structural change within the company that will bring Billions in revenue over the years, couple it with the current market conditions and it gives you rocket fuel ü•Å for one of the best positioned company of the next 10+ years

1np10yv,wallstreetbets,Just bought TTD,"I saw a DD here on TTD a few days ago and decided to jump in. They are the market leader in what they do. Some will say it‚Äôs overvalued. Well, in my experience market doesn‚Äôt run on overvalued or undervalued, only on emotions. 
Price seems pretty low currently so I bought in.

The Trade Desk (TTD) continues to demonstrate its strength as a long-term investment in the evolving digital advertising space. The company‚Äôs robust demand-side platform enables advertisers to manage and optimize data-driven campaigns across various channels, including connected TV (CTV)‚Äîa segment growing rapidly as traditional TV declines. CEO Jeff Green has previously stated, ‚ÄúWe process more transactions in one day than Visa does in a year,‚Äù underscoring the scale and efficiency of their real-time bidding architecture. TTD‚Äôs platform is built on transparency and independence, positioning it well against walled gardens like Google and Meta.

Institutional confidence in TTD is also rising. Notably, Intech Investment Management LLC boosted its stake by over 5,700%, Los Angeles Capital Management LLC initiated a $68.6 million position, and ARK Invest (Cathie Wood) recently added 210,664 shares (~$29.5M) to its ARKW fund. LaFleur & Godfrey LLC and several others have also increased exposure. These large bets from respected hedge funds signal strong conviction in TTD‚Äôs scalability and future cash flow.

Given its proven leadership, deep industry integration, and consistent innovation in programmatic ad tech, TTD is well-positioned for long-term growth‚Äîespecially as advertisers shift more spend toward measurable, real-time channels like CTV.

My positions included. This is not financial advice. Invest or not, at your own risk.",41,34,2025-09-24 02:47:55,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np10yv,2025-09-25 02:29:34.883049

I had a small amount of cash leftover in my Roth IRA and purchased RYCEY, and wow has it blown up; granted its been a few years coming.

  
Not a professional, and never made a DD before, but it still feels like space and Nuclear are on a roll of sorts, and have more to come in the future. Maybe buying into RYCEY right now is worth a shot?

1nom7oj,wallstreetbets,MU - $1m ER shares yolo.,"NFA, DYOR.

Options were kinda expensive on this one so I didn't think they were underpriced. Being said - lots of shit / potential catalysts around this one that I am unsure if market has priced in yet. Look at all NVDA's recent partnerships (OpenAI in particular - I'm looking at you). I believe micron provides the memory for nvidia GPU's and it may have potential to go brr. Dunno - it's an ER play. I actually don't really know what these guys do to be honest, just lots of chatter & I blindly trusted chat. I'm likely rotating out of micron within a week. These were bought this morning as I rotated out of $SNAP calls. I didn't like how options were priced on this one so monkeyed into shares instead.

It's already ran 40% last month, so high risk. I love buying the top.

Goodluck to all in the cino

\[Update\] Literally flat. Boring. My call about options being overpriced was correct, these are up \~0.5% if AH holds tomorrow. Glad I bought shares & didn't play options here. Theta gang printing tho. I'm up like 5-10k on the AH movement. Theta gang & shares won this one.

\[Update 2\] Might make like 1.5-2% on these tomorrow. Seems to be trending upwards. Lots of people bullish in the other threads - suggesting a hold is an alright bet. My read about overpriced vol seems to be correct tho - options are not the play on this one. I'll update chat when I exit.

1nolrsv,wallstreetbets,$SNAP - Final update. Rolled all options profits into shares (20k share freeroll),"Same shit I did on my other plays. I trade options which I believe are underpriced, tend to very quickly take profits (usually in < 2 weeks, despite the fact I'm trading leaps) and roll profits into the underlying. IE: $SNAP. IMO this one is likely to run over 10 after the next ER's (the drop was due to a bug in their advertising platform). I stand by my previous investment + DD.

My trading style involves using leaps / far expiration options for risk mitigation (ie: if my thesis is wrong - I can just keep holding / re-evaluate) & to leverage my bets. This one made me \~16-18% in a week, which is a fantastic return IMO. I got a 20k snap share freeroll out of it - which IMO should pay very well. I don't like following things long term with options, so just hold shares on things I previously followed.

For evidence of risk mitigation - look at my history for how I played GTLB. I bought before ER's and they ate a -12% overnight (while I was long OTM calls). I woke up to a \~25% unrealized loss. I held for 2 weeks and managed to sell for a \~5% profit - as I re-evaluated risk matrix after the drop & decided it was positive EV to continue to hold.

I only follow a few tickers at once & never went broke from taking profits. Rotating my trading capital elsewhere into another (imo) undervalued thing. There's a few on my radar.

1nok0rp,wallstreetbets,RedCat because I LOVE kitty üê±,"Secretary of Defense, Hegseth‚Äôs drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. 

The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports.

""While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,"" Hegseth said in the video online. ""Not anymore.""

The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by ""approving hundreds of American products"" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a ""variety of low-cost drones"" made by American engineers and AI experts.

The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use.

""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,"" the memo said.

Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars.

""Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,"" Hegseth wrote in the memo.

The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace.

As of their recent Town Hall announcement, RedCat has finally received the green light from the Army to announce LRIP (Low Rate Initial Production) portion of the SRR contract. Announcing 690 systems rather previous 550. Their guidance for fiscal year is 80-120M projected to hit 55M for Q3 this year. Today, they announced their first delivery of 45 systems for a total of $3.5M. We did the numbers and it took them approximately 3.4 days to deliver 45 drones, which indicates they can easily produce, deliver and execute. 

Following news today, RedCat‚Äôs Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat‚Äôs drones. 

They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options

TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. 
Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO.

Genius Sports (GENI) ‚Äì Equity Research Report

Rating: Buy | Price Target: $40/share

Company Overview
Genius Sports is a leading provider of official sports data, video, and media technology services. It operates in three segments: Betting Technology & Services, Media Technology & Services, and Sports Technology & Services. Its core business revolves around delivering low-latency, official data feeds, integrity solutions, and media/ad-tech solutions to sportsbooks, leagues, and advertisers.

Industry Structure: The Duopoly
The global sports data industry has consolidated into a duopoly between Genius Sports and Sportradar. Most top-tier leagues have signed official rights contracts with one of these two players.
This grants both companies pricing power, sticky multi-year contracts, and significant barriers to entry. Sportradar's acquisition of IMG Arena and Genius Sports' extended NFL exclusive rights through 2030 reinforce this structure.

Catalyst: December 3, 2025 Investor Day
On December 3, 2025, Genius Sports will host its Investor Day in New York City. The company will demonstrate its product suite, growth strategy, and financial outlook. Investors are expected to gain a clearer understanding of the depth, breadth, and strength of Genius‚Äô rapidly growing Media segment, guided to grow at least 60% YoY in 2H-2025. The Investor Day will likely highlight product demos, fan intelligence capabilities (via the Sports Innovation Lab acquisition), and advertising integrations, which may catalyze investor confidence and support valuation re-rating.

Media Business Growth
Genius‚Äô Media business, driven by FANHub, ad-tech integrations, and fan intelligence tools, is the fastest-growing part of the company. With ~60% YoY growth guided for H2-2025, management aims to establish Media as a core driver of margin expansion. This segment is expected to mature into a higher-margin, software-like business, improving Genius‚Äô overall profitability profile.

Why Genius Sports and Sportradar Are the Visa & Mastercard of Sports Betting
‚Ä¢ Two-Sided Networks: They connect leagues (rights owners) with sportsbooks/media operators,similar to how Visa/Mastercard connect merchants and cardholders.
‚Ä¢ Mission-Critical Infrastructure: Official live data feeds are indispensable for in-play betting, just as cardrails are essential for commerce.
‚Ä¢ Duopoly Resilience: Like Visa and Mastercard, two scaled networks coexist globally, ensuringredundancy and pricing balance.
‚Ä¢ Embedded Growth: Both are layering new services (media, AI, video) like Visa/Mastercard layeredfraud prevention, cross-border fees, and loyalty.
‚Ä¢ High Switching Costs: Sportsbooks cannot risk losing official feeds, echoing merchants‚Äô dependenceon card networks.
Path to $40/share
GENI trades around $12.79 today. To reach $40 (~$10B equity value), the company must scale revenue from ~$645M in 2025 to ~$1.2‚Äì1.3B by 2027‚Äì2028, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to 25‚Äì30% or more. That would yield ~$350‚Äì$400M EBITDA. At a premium 25x EV/EBITDA multiple, supported by duopoly economics and rapid Media growth, GENI‚Äôs valuation aligns with $40/share.

Exhibit: GENI Share Price Bridge to $40

Risks
‚Ä¢ Rights renewal risk: leagues may demand higher economics or switch providers.
‚Ä¢ Ad-market cyclicality could slow Media growth if brand budgets decline.
‚Ä¢ Competitive pressure from Sportradar or new entrants in specific markets.
‚Ä¢ Regulatory risks affecting betting, advertising, or data usage.
Conclusion
Genius Sports and Sportradar stand as the two strongest business models in the global sports betting industry, analogous to Visa and Mastercard in payments. Both firms benefit from scale, rights exclusivity, and embedded network effects. With rapid Media growth, a clear duopoly, and the upcoming December 2025 Investor Day as a catalyst, we see GENI‚Äôs path to $40/share as realistic within 2‚Äì3 years. We assign a Buy rating with a $40/share price target.",26,35,2025-09-23 04:50:09,https://i.redd.it/qa3n1w0nhuqf1.jpeg,2025-09-25 02:29:34.883216

* If even¬†*one*¬†of them lands a big hyperscaler contract (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, w.e), it‚Äôs an instant¬†**2x+**.
* My bet is on¬†**$IREN**¬†leading the pack. They‚Äôre scaling fast, and the ‚ÄúAI miner pivot‚Äù narrative is just starting.

# The Setup:

1nnr3mg,wallstreetbets,YOLO $600k+ speculation on MUX as Barrick M&A target,"Commodities like gold, silver, and uranium have the sex appeal for investors doing moon math on free cash flow from rising commodity prices. However, looking at the strategic focus of mining majors, they are in love with copper, especially supermassive, cheap copper porphyry deposits up in the Andes in newly liberalized Argentina. Case in point is the recent Teck+Anglo merger, a harbinger of M&A to come in the copper space.

Most of the juicy Andes copper deposits have been taken by the Lundin clan, but MUX has one remaining supermassive copper project in Los Azules. Doing napkin math on Los Azules economics at current copper prices gets a NPV that suggests MUX's Los Azules stake easily exceeds the enterprise value of MUX, not counting McEwen's substantial though mediocre gold mining operations.

https://preview.redd.it/fjp6nir5qqqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb2c56e12b8146accf6099bcaa23e1c941cffa6

I see Barrick as most likely acquirer given their existing operations in the same San Juan province of Argentina, given their nearby Veladero JV with Shandong Gold. Most of their operational/regulatory know-how readily translates out to building Los Azules. In my eye, the Los Azules dream team would be Barrick as operator, and Shandong Gold/Rio Tinto/McEwen Mining as minority equity partners given operational, technological, and exploration expertise on the Los Azules geology. In my calculation, Barrick could plausibly build out Los Azules with fronting just a couple hundred million of project equity with these partners, writing a royalty to FNV/WPM, and taking reasonable levels of project debt.

The other potential operator is Rio Tinto who is already on the Los Azules cap table. While Rio has nearby Argentina operations, they are in the Salta province and their workforce/operational knowledge is less readily translatable to Los Azules.

MUX has a long-awaited technical report on Los Azules coming out next month. It has been delayed a couple times, and my read of the delays is that they are due to scope creep, i.e. positive surprises that necessitate further exploration/testing than originally envisioned. MUX has verbally indicated plans for an IPO of the stake and potentially building out the project themselves, but IMO this is just positioning/angling for stronger hand in M&A negotiations. Either way, once that technical report comes out, I believe the stock can move very quickly.

Wish me luck as I have a degenerately large portfolio fraction on this bet. I plan to hold options into year end and may trade in and out of shares.

**Disclaimer: This is purely my own speculation with no confirmations, my napkin math has been very wrong in the past. I am not an investment professional, this is not investment advice.**

1nnn5y4,wallstreetbets,SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake,"**SkyWater Technology ($SKYT) - Prospective White House/DOD Stake:**¬†

* Skywater (SKYT) is a special company. It‚Äôs a US semiconductor manufacturer sitting at the intersection of two secular themes: (1) Domestic, trusted supply of US military chips, and (2) picks and shovels exposure to quantum computing.

**Core defense/specialty foundry (\~80% of revenue)**

* Skywater is one of 12 DMEA category 1-A trusted foundries certified to supply chips to the US DoD. For those of you too lazy to look up what that means, this is basically the Fort Knox of chip fabs, and it‚Äôs hard to get. Unlike peers embedded in large conglomerates (BAE, Raytheon, ON),¬†**SKYT is one of the ONLY public pureplays on US military chip fabrication**.

**SKYT has two important facilities:**

* Florida advanced packaging: the DoD awarded SKYT $120mm (with options up to $190mm) to build this out. It is trusted & accredited and almost ready to start ramping. Outputs will be used in¬†**drones, electronic warfare, guided munitions, and space avionics.**
* Austin fab: this was owned by Infineon and SKYT is acquiring it. It was not ‚Äútrusted‚Äù before, but under Skywater, it will be. It previously specialized in industrial/auto end markets, but now will be eligible to supply chips for¬†**drones, satellites, missiles, and comms gear.**

**Quantum & Photonics (\~20% of revenue)**

* Donald mentioned the word ‚Äúquantum‚Äù 5 times in his speech with Starmer last week. The hype cycle is in full swing. And Skywater is the classic picks and shovels play.
* While every PhD with a powerpoint is burning through VC cash\*\*, Skywater is one of the only companies actually getting paid\*\*.¬† They provide essential foundry services and photonics platforms that quantum players need for their chips and devices. Management has called out double digit y/y growth, and if quantum really takes off, this business could hockey stick.

**Policy Tailwinds & Strategic Importance**

* The CEO, Thomas Sonderman, has been busy in Washington. Just earlier this month he was seen at the White House with top brass, including Michael Kratsios, the Chief Technology Officer of the United States. Kratsios is responsible for crafting the US quantum strategy (photos attached).
   * [Michael J.K Kratsios - Department of War Bio](https://www.war.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/2279091/michael-jk-kratsios/)
* SKYT is already in the club. They‚Äôre pre-vetted and pre-funded. Next up could be CHIPs grants, new DoD IDIQs/OTAs, and though a long shot, maybe even a direct government equity check.

**Why Now?**

* ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù is getting publicity at the highest levels. Attention = budgets.
* SKYT‚Äôs Florida facility is nearly ready to ramp. This probably means some big DoD orders are on the way. They paid for it after all.¬†
* At today‚Äôs market cap, you‚Äôre buying a critical part of the US defense/quantum supply chain at a total bargain.¬†

**TLDR:** $SKYT is a tiny company with a license to print money from the Pentagon. They are one of the only pureplays building ""Made in the USA"" chips for the military. They are also the picks and shovels play for the quantum computing industry, collecting tolls from whoever wins. Technology. Skywater already has a seat at the table and is Chummy with DOD Pals.

**Position:** Nov/Dec/Jan $20 Call

1nmucye,wallstreetbets,The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Dual Mandate Is Outdated And The Data Used For Decisions Are Wrong. A Better Approach From Escorts.,"The Fed claims to balance price stability with maximum employment. In practice, both pillars are built on sand:

Job creation data is constantly revised downward... the latest BLS revision wiped out 911,000 jobs like a bad typo.

The unemployment rate is essentially fan fiction. It counts gig workers, Uber drivers, OnlyFans creators, and yes, technically even escorts, prostitutes, hookers, and strippers as ‚Äúemployed.‚Äù

Inflation at ‚Äú3%‚Äù is a joke. My grocery bill, rent, and utilities all disagree.

The truth is, the economy runs on a far more honest set of forces: men‚Äôs disposable income to spend on sex work and women‚Äôs willingness to sell companionship.

So I propose a new, more accurate Dual Mandate for the Federal Reserve:

1. Balance the number of men who can still afford escorts, prostitutes, hookers, strippers, and sugar babies.

2. Balance the number of women entering sex work out of economic necessity.


Here‚Äôs the model:

Bad economy: More women enter the industry due to lack of alternatives while men cut back on spending

Good economy: Fewer women stay in sex work since they have better alternatives; men who can afford it spend more


Forget CPI. The true measure of inflation is the Escort Asking Rate Index (EARI‚Ñ¢) a basket of advertised rates across cities. If her hourly goes up, it‚Äôs because her rent, groceries, and Uber rides went up. That‚Äôs a real-time, boots-on-the-ground measure of cost of living.

So if you want price stability and full employment? Look no further than the front page of Tryst and Seeking instead of opaque & confusing calculations done by economists

As a future Fed official, I‚Äôll ensure every FOMC meeting includes a robust discussion of escort pricing trends before setting interest rates. Powell had his dot plot. I‚Äôll have my thot plot.

1nm0a5q,wallstreetbets,Huge Micron Bet,"Hey everyone,

First time with a DD so forgive me if I sound regarded. 

This is the biggest trade I am set up for and wanted to share my thoughts. 

I believe we are going to see a huge run up next Tuesday with Microns earnings call. Current price is $162 with the pull back with Samsungs announcement spooking the market but I believe this won‚Äôt affect Microns future capabilities with HBM.  

So Micron Q4 earnings are coming up‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm bullish. I took up a huge position with the underlying prior to the pump on Thursday. 

Yesterday with the drop I loaded up at the bottom on 200 calls $175 expiring October 17. 

My logic is this. 

Seeing what happened with Oracle over their guidance gives me confident we may expect something crazy from Micron, especially when their customers Nvidia, Amd, Microsoft, Amazon, Google all had record years. All of them just crushed it on AI and cloud growth.

If they‚Äôre winning, Micron is too. Every GPU and every data center relies on Micron‚Äôs memory to run. While there are 2 main competitors in the memory landscape (Samsung and SK Hynix) I believe Micron is well positioned regardless. 

Last quarter: $9.3B in revenue with nearly 50% growth in high-bandwidth memory sales.

Next up: Management is guiding ~$10.7B for Q4 with stronger margins. I think they may beat expectations. 

In all of the last 5 reported fiscal quarters listed above, Micron has beaten EPS expectations.  Ôøº

The beat amounts range from ~+$0.13 to ~+$0.34 in recent quarters.

The most recent (Q3 FY2025) was the largest beat in that sample, +$0.34

However with this upcoming Q4 FY 2025, EPS consensus estimates are around $2.78-$2.86 per share. Year-over-year that‚Äôs a big jump from ~$1.18 in Q4 FY2024.  Ôøº
	
Gross margin expectations have been revised up, reflecting tight supply + improved pricing (especially DRAM).

Analyst Quotes & Price Targets

Wedbush (Matt Bryson) ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúWedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Micron Technology to $200 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm notes that demand from cloud service providers has come in stronger than expected, which could significantly boost Micron‚Äôs future sales and pricing power. Wedbush believes that the ongoing AI build-out is creating a structural uplift in demand for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that will continue through 2026.‚Äù „ÄêBarron‚Äôs„Äë

Barclays ‚Äì PT $175

‚ÄúBarclays analysts raised their Micron target price to $175 from about $140, while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analysts acknowledged that some of the recent NAND chip orders coming out of Silicon Valley may be short-term in nature, but they believe Micron will likely exceed its current guidance. They also expect the company to offer a strong forward outlook as hyperscaler spending on AI infrastructure continues at an aggressive pace.‚Äù „ÄêBarron‚Äôs„Äë

Deutsche Bank (Melissa Weathers) ‚Äì PT $175

‚ÄúDeutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers lifted her price target on Micron shares from $155 to $175, reiterating a Buy rating. She noted that favorable market conditions for DRAM and high-bandwidth memory, particularly products tied to artificial intelligence data centers, are a major driver of upside. Weathers added that DRAM pricing has remained firm, supply is constrained, and demand for HBM in GPUs and servers is accelerating faster than the Street had anticipated.‚Äù „ÄêInvestors.com„Äë

Mizuho (Vijay Rakesh) ‚Äì PT $182

‚ÄúMizuho Securities raised its price target on Micron to $182 and kept a Buy rating. Analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote that momentum around artificial intelligence and strong demand for high-bandwidth memory should continue to drive Micron‚Äôs results higher. He cited tight supply in both DRAM and NAND, with pricing moving upward, as well as Micron‚Äôs increasing share of AI-focused products. Rakesh emphasized that Micron is one of the few companies positioned to deliver both volume growth and margin expansion in this environment.‚Äù „ÄêMarketWatch„Äë

UBS (Timothy Arcuri) ‚Äì PT $185

‚ÄúUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Micron‚Äôs price target to $185 and reiterated a Buy rating. Arcuri pointed to confidence in DRAM and HBM supply tightness and sustained AI-related growth as the core reasons for the higher target. He noted that Micron‚Äôs technology roadmap has been executing well and that the company is positioned to capture outsized share of the high-performance memory demand wave driven by Nvidia, AMD, and hyperscalers.‚Äù „ÄêPriceTargets.com„Äë

Susquehanna ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúSusquehanna Financial upgraded its Micron target to $200, keeping a Positive rating. Analysts cited tightening DRAM and NAND supply, improving average selling prices across memory, and accelerating AI adoption as reasons to expect Micron‚Äôs earnings power to surprise to the upside. The firm believes current Street estimates remain too low given the structural tailwinds in AI-centric workloads.‚Äù „ÄêPriceTargets.com„Äë

JPMorgan (Harlan Sur) ‚Äì PT $185

‚ÄúJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised Micron‚Äôs price target to $185 from $160 and kept an Overweight rating. Sur highlighted upside to revenue, gross margin, and earnings in the near term, driven by better-than-expected pricing across multiple end-markets including AI data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. He said the company is likely to announce November-quarter guidance that comes in solidly ahead of consensus expectations. JPMorgan believes Micron‚Äôs HBM3E ramp and DRAM cost reductions are ahead of schedule, which will further support earnings acceleration.‚Äù „ÄêBenzinga„Äë

Rosenblatt Securities (Kevin Cassidy) ‚Äì PT $200

‚ÄúRosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy reaffirmed a Buy rating on Micron and boosted the firm‚Äôs target to $200. Cassidy wrote that Micron could report a modest beat to its preannounced results, but the real story will be the outlook. He expects Micron‚Äôs November-quarter guidance may come in much higher than consensus estimates of $11.8 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00. Cassidy emphasized that constrained DRAM and NAND Flash wafer supply through at least 2026, alongside accelerating demand from AI workloads, positions Micron for outsized profitability.‚Äù „ÄêBenzinga„Äë

‚ÄúZacks recently upgraded Micron from Hold to Strong Buy, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #1. Their analysts cite accelerating demand for DRAM and NAND, stronger-than-expected revenue in AI/data center markets, and consistent earnings surprises as the drivers. Zacks‚Äô consensus 12-month price target from ~34 analysts is $155.59, with estimates ranging from as low as $75 to as high as $200.

Micron Management Quotes & Context

‚ÄúMicron‚Äôs strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, with revenue, gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.‚Äù ‚Äî Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO.  Ôøº

‚ÄúData center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level, and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth.‚Äù ‚Äî Mehrotra.  Ôøº
	
‚ÄúWe generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter, even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth.‚Äù ‚Äî Mehrotra.  Ôøº
	
‚ÄúMicron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue.‚Äù ‚Äî Mehrotra.  Ôøº

‚ÄúWe are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI-driven memory demand.‚Äù ‚Äî Mehrotra.  Ôøº

‚ÄúFiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $7.1 billion, up 51% year over year, and represented 76% of total revenue. Sequentially, DRAM revenue increased 15%, with bit shipments increasing over 20% and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a higher consumer-oriented revenue mix.‚Äù ‚Äî Mark Murphy, CFO.  Ôøº

‚ÄúNAND revenue was $2.2 billion ‚Ä¶ Sequentially, NAND revenue increased 16%, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.‚Äù ‚Äî Murphy.  Ôøº

‚ÄúGross margin ‚Ä¶ was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially offset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.‚Äù ‚Äî CFO Murphy.  Ôøº
	
‚ÄúEnding inventory for fiscal Q3 was $8.7 billion, or 139 days. Inventory was down $280 million sequentially, and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially, driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.‚Äù ‚Äî Murphy.  Ôøº
	
Guidance for Q4:
‚ÄúWe expect revenue of $10.7 billion ¬± $300 million; gross margin non-GAAP of ~42% ¬± 1%; operating expenses approx $1.2 billion ¬± $20 million; non-GAAP EPS of ~$2.50 ¬± $0.15 per share.‚Äù ‚Äî Micron management.  Ôøº

‚ÄúWith another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4, we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix.‚Äù ‚Äî Management.  Ôøº

TLDR

Best Case (Bullish)

Revenue: ~$11.2B+ (above top of guidance)

EPS: $2.90+ (beats revised $2.85 guide)

Gross Margin: 45%+ (tight supply + strong DRAM/HBM pricing)

Guidance: Raised again for FY2026, pointing to sustained AI/cloud demand
	
Stock Impact: Could rally +20‚Äì30%, pushing toward $180‚Äì$200 as analysts hike targets

Worst Case (Bearish)

Revenue: < $11.0B (below guide midpoint)

EPS: < $2.70 (miss vs Street ~$2.78‚Äì$2.85)

Margins: Slip toward 42‚Äì43% (pricing softness, higher costs)

Guidance: Conservative, signaling slower demand or inventory concerns

Stock Impact: Could drop ‚àí10‚Äì25%, retracing toward $120‚Äì$130

The biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up, I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular. 

Right now PE is ~24-25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit $10-12 for FY 2026, and PE drops to 18-20 we are still looking at $200+ price target. I believe $175-185 is a lower range.

1nlw4qk,wallstreetbets,Netflix to bid on $WBD,"[https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/](https://screenrant.com/netflix-bidding-warner-bros-report/)

>EDIT:   
  
  
After Paramount CEO David Ellison's ""presumptive all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery,"" Puck's Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that ""a well-placed Hollywood source called to suggest \[...\] that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav's \[WBD CEO and president\] assets.""

>Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once ""implausible,"" but that ""Ellison's seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood's consolidation process, and his decision to bid for all of WBD now‚Äîin an attempt to preempt potential rivals‚Äîis forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models.""

>These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros.' historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office. However, Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo ""does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond $19 a share"" and that ""neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD.""

>Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros.' studio and streaming operations, Byers says: ""\[...\] as I discussed on Sunday, Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons‚Äîthat two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand.""

>As far as what Paramount's possibly buying Warner Bros. means, the merging of two of Hollywood's oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry. Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea, as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros.' assets, including games, comics, and more. Netflix's offer might mean splitting up parts of the company.

TL:DR - they probably want to spin-off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of $ from the Ellisons for the whole thing.

Seems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY. Ellisons offered $22-24/share, think some analysts were calling 21/share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done.",302,95,2025-09-20 11:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nlw4qk/netflix_to_bid_on_wbd/,2025-09-25 02:29:37.240260

1nl8km0,wallstreetbets,Duolingo DD,"Dear, Ladies, gentleman and degenerate market regards

I‚Äôve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo. You might be saying ‚Äúwtf the language learning app?‚Äù. Yes correct, that app with the green owl. A company can be selling dog food for all I care, but if the numbers and the narrative are good, I'm buying. That being said, Duolingo ($DUOL) is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall. Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made. When everyone is betting on the downfall, you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all. The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore.

Would also like to mention, if you‚Äôre an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio, so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million, then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on.

**The Narrative**

The bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market. The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI, and the tech giant GOOGLE. People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo. Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion. Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well, which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI. Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true; however, if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning, then Duolingo must compete. Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from $542 to $282 as of today. Can the stock fall further? Yes it can, but it's one of those scenarios where you want it to.

The P/E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025. Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company, (a fair valuation for growth companies range between (40-80) however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher. Today that P/E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15:1. Yes those numbers still do seem high, but¬†

as their free cash flow continues to rise, that P/E ratio will drop into fair valuations. Understand that this company is growing on average 40% year over year. For those who don't understand, markets are always forward looking. The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings, revenue and forward guidance.

**The Bull Thesis**

So before being able to predict the future, you first need to look into the past where history doesn't always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. Take a look at the success of Netflix. Even when Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google (youtube) entered the space of video streaming, people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble. In 2011, Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription; while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60%.¬†

Customers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter. This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011, to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011. Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013 (you can see how the stock follows that on the charts).

**The Moat**

There is no moat. Just branding. ‚ÄúHow is this bullish?‚Äù Well lets think, what‚Äôs Spotify's moat? What about Netflix? Literally just branding is the moat, so people who think duolingo‚Äôs demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional. It‚Äôs like saying in the year 2000, ‚Äúwhy would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books?‚Äù fucking regards.¬†

**User Experience**

When you look at music streaming services, spotify ($SPOT) was the first to the game publicly. Eventually, Apple, Google (youtube), Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game. Yet to this day, spotify is what‚Äôs most popular among them all taking 36% of the music streaming market. Why? User experience is the answer. The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers.¬†

**The Brand**

The infamous green owl logo is famous across the world. Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning. When people hear that ‚Äúding\* sound completing a duolingo game, everyone knows instantly that it's duolingo. When people ask about learning another language, they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo. It's literally the rank #13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of ‚Äúessential apps.‚Äù

	When people talk to each other about music they ask ‚Äúwhat's you‚Äôre spotify?‚Äù Nobody asks whats your ‚Äúapple music, amazon music or youtube music‚Äù

	When your wife‚Äôs boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie, he says ‚Äúnetflix and chill‚Äù NOT ‚Äúamazon prime, disney, or apple tv and chill?‚Äù the fuck?

I'm listing these examples, because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo. That being said, duolingo‚Äôs subscription model is actually better than theirs.

**Business Model**

Ad revenue and subscriptions, that's it. People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification. You got kids who are using this damn app in school, recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids. Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music, math and chess.¬†

Wait? Chess? Wtf?¬†

Yes that's exactly what I'm thinking, but if you look beyond that, Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market. Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100+ additional learning courses. Ideally, duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform, more directed towards the youth for everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they included courses like science, finance, health etc‚Ä¶

	They have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers/course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace. Their first 100 courses took them 12 years. Now with AI, they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year.

	There is NO FRICTION.

* No governments/regulations trying to stop this
* No maintenance on their assets (courses)
* No real competition in user experience

All they have to do is create a great product (a course), add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription. The more they add, the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere.

**The Bear Thesis**

Go fuck yourself?

On a serious note, looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free; it does seem to be very reliable, but strictly for translating. They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free. Not to mention, there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate. Comparing it to Duolingo, yes both of them are free, however; google has not announced whether they would¬† put a pay wall behind learning/using their practice tool. However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification.¬†

If the companies continues to show slower growth, or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters; well then, we‚Äôre fucked. But as of right now, the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn‚Äôt ""catastrophic,"" but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative.¬†

**External Risks**

Rising interest rates. Lets be real, trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn't want to follow through with it. In the long term event that they can‚Äôt afford to lower rates but rather might¬† increase rates; the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022-2023, which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole.

Another external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold, and extreme volatility in government bond markets, more specifically the 10 year yield bonds. For those who don't understand, a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system, because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset.

Free cash flow = cash from operations - capital expenditures.

Notice how their free cash flow keeps on rising? Notice how free cash flow has dropped in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025? That small decline in free cash flow, paired with the narrative of the company's demise in the future has resulted in a crash from $542 to $282. Let me tell you right now, if this company reports an increase in free cash flow in the next few earnings calls; Not only can the narrative change from negative to positive, this stock can very well turn around and go bullish very fast.¬†

The stock price of Duolingo hovering at $270 is basically assuming the company‚Äôs growth over the next 5 years would only be at about 25%. If you take a look at the numbers above, the only thing that's under 25% are the monthly active users. The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35% YoY growth; which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory. The company has been growing at about 45% annually over the past 5 years, so yes a 35% growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth. But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company, believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all; this would be an amazing buying opportunity.¬†

P.S -This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. This is just my opinion on my projections of this company's stock price. If you buy high, panic, then sell low, too bad, sucks for you. Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don't know how long this negative narrative will play out. (maybe **WRITING** covered calls OTM for a passive income) If you're a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings **Buying** OTM call options, good luck.

1nl4gc6,wallstreetbets,US DOE launches Speed to Power initiative to meet rising demand,"*The U.S. Department of Energy has launched the Speed to Power initiative to accelerate large-scale generation and transmission projects that can support the country‚Äôs rising energy needs. The DOE argues that current project development is moving too slowly to meet the demands of reindustrialization and the growing manufacturing base, as well as the surging load from artificial intelligence and data centers. By working with stakeholders, the department aims to identify projects that can deliver power reliably while addressing the challenges of today‚Äôs grid.*

*Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will need much more energy in the years ahead and emphasized that, under President Trump‚Äôs leadership, the DOE intends to ensure this demand can be met with affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Speed to Power initiative is designed to harness private-sector expertise and expand the use of all viable energy sources so the United States can remain competitive in the global AI race.*

*The first step is a request for information to collect input on large-scale projects, including both generation and transmission. The program builds on Trump‚Äôs first-day executive order declaring a National Energy Emergency, which called for an urgent expansion of energy infrastructure to strengthen both national and economic security.*

*In connection with that order, the DOE released a report on grid reliability and security that sets a standard methodology to identify regions most at risk and guide interventions. The report warns that if firm, reliable sources are not added as older capacity retires, blackouts could rise one hundredfold by 2030.*

*The Speed to Power initiative is aligned with the administration‚Äôs executive orders on unleashing U.S. energy and boosting American leadership in AI, directing federal resources toward removing barriers and ensuring grid infrastructure keeps pace with demand. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are viewed as an important part of this broader effort, offering new firm nuclear capacity that can be deployed more quickly and flexibly than traditional large-scale plants, helping to reinforce reliability while meeting growing power needs.*",253,151,2025-09-19 14:03:22,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-doe-launches-speed-power-110343255.html,2025-09-25 02:29:37.240537
1nl4g6m,wallstreetbets,$TTD DD: The Tendie Desk,"If you‚Äôve seen my last couple posts I‚Äôve been pretty good at picking stocks near the bottom before a bull run. CRDO, NBIS, ENTG, GLXY and most recently MNDY which I did a DD on. The problem is I‚Äôm a regard and mismanaged all of them for a loss except MNDY, but I‚Äôm rolling those gains into what I present before you today: $TTD. 

TTD is an ad tech company that has received a series of aggressive prison beatings in the market on its way to becoming S&P 500‚Äôs worst performing stock of 2025. They act as the Don Draper of advertising, so if you‚Äôre a company that wants to advertise on platforms outside of the walled gardens you don‚Äôt call each company individually you call TTD and they help you find the best spots for your money across the channels they have access to. Most of TTD‚Äôs slide this year is in reaction to the walled gardens (GOOG, AMZN, META) getting bigger because TTD doesn‚Äôt have access to youtube, prime video and ig.

[Shanked by Google, jumped by Amazon, and left holding META's lunch tray. ](https://preview.redd.it/j4cdi2znn4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3a6bef7e1489a97126b63dca60e2c49fe2ff07)

They aren‚Äôt taking this lying down, TTD bought back $647 mil between the first two quarters of 25 and have $375 mil left to use under that approval. Buybacks like this are bc the c suite is either putting their dicks on the table and saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre undervalued‚Äù or they want to cook the books and boost eps. I don‚Äôt care either way because I think they‚Äôll buoy the share price at the 52 wk low. The fed cuts also boost valuation models making future earnings look better for a growth stock like TTD. 

The DOJ vs. Goog ad tech remedies case begins next week. Guilt for Goog has already been decided, this is now about how they will change their monopoly on digital advertising by controlling both the publisher and ad exchange. DOJ is pushing for a breakup of the stack, which would give TTD access to premium inventory and be a huge tailwind. Most of the c suite for TTD has testified at one point in this trial and the CEO said ‚ÄúTTD managed to win in an unfair market, imagine what we could do in a fair market‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm putting my $$ on CEO Jeff Green‚Äôs imaginings. 

[Got flamed last time for posting after my position was already up so this is hot off the press.](https://preview.redd.it/m6lu0fd3o4qf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d54a33d6a6fbefca78b474a478c3e828bb6b776)

Final considerations are for their new AI tools and the possibility of M&A. Kokai and OpenPath will be fully launched by the end of this year, these are meaningful next gen innovations. Brands using Kokai so far have seen a 43% lower cost per household reach on ads and OpenPath has led to 39% bump in CTV revenue for clients like Vizio. If the remedies case forces Goog to make major changes, the rest of big tech could say fuck it and buy TTD given the current depressed valuation, giving better reach in the open internet and picking up a competitor. Big media like Disney or Roku could also integrate or partner to control supply path and reduce dependency, like what we just saw with Amazon and Netflix. 

Also incredibly small flyer chance TikTok‚Äôs walled garden is opened up in the US acquisition giving TTD further opportunity.",90,61,2025-09-19 14:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nl4g6m/ttd_dd_the_tendie_desk/,2025-09-25 02:29:37.240561

1nkow7c,wallstreetbets,[GAP]PING UP,"Alright, listen up you degenerates - while everyone is fomo-ing over AI, Semiconductors, Opendoor & New/Old-age tech memes - there's some real $$ to be made on some lesser focused, social arbitrage, value plays that have real potential to make 20, 30, 40%+ moves. I don't know where the rest of them are, but I'm talking about $GAP. This is a weird one but hear me out and look at my dd and let me know if I'm regarded.  
  
So why **$GAP?** I first thought about $GAP after $AEO's most recent earnings, where they shot up 40%+ after hours on results. This got me interested because the headlines for the earnings move were ""Sydney Sweeney"" related and the controversy her campaign generated, which translated into billions of impressions and many new customers. For anyone not on social media, $GAP capitalized on $AEO's controversy with their own denim ad in collaboration with KATSEYE - a global girl group which had recently been gaining insane traction with their own Netflix show, performances, and viral songs (Gnarly, Gabriela, etc.). The $GAP Denim ad went mega-viral across all social media and spawned videos everywhere of everyone replicating the dance in Denim - free advertising for $GAP. At this point, it's just an idea - so let's do some digging:  
  
**WHY DID AEO SURGE AFTER EARNINGS?**

To better understand the potential value $GAP - I wanted to better understand what made $AEO move so much after earnings. Here's what I found:

* Better than expected earnings, EPS $0.45 v $0.20 ‚Äì 125% surprise beat and 15% YoY increase. They were beaten down after pulling their initial guidance, causing major uncertainty amongst investors.

* Revenue at $1.28B ‚Äì beat expectations by 4.07%. Revenue was flat compared to prior year but still beat expectations and profitability surprise drove the run-up.

* Share buyback program YTD has reduced outstanding diluted shares by 10%, which contributed to increased EPS.

* Successful Marketing campaign wins in collaboration with Sydney Sweeney & Travis Kelce. According to the earnings call ‚Äì 40 billion impressions, 700k new customer count, selling out of Sydney‚Äôs labeled AE products.

* Cost control which contributed to surprise EPS beat ‚Äì SG&A down from last year & lower promotional activity.

* Optimistic commentary from management ‚Äì they noted that they saw ‚Äúnice upticks‚Äù in the AE business in Q3 ‚Äì signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook ‚Äì coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline). The revenues remained flat this quarter, which was surprising from how they talked about the success of their campaign, but this was explained by some of their core products being laggers (shorts). The lag was offset by the influx of new customers via the Sydney Sweeney ads.

* They noted that they saw ‚Äúnice upticks‚Äù in the AE business in Q3 ‚Äì signaling an optimistic Q3 outlook ‚Äì coupled with a relatively strong guidance than expectations (low single digit growth vs a small YoY decline)¬†

They were also at a depressed valuation, especially after their poor Q1 Results, with P/E hovering between 9x-11x months after their Q1 earnings and before Q2 earnings. Understandable as the CEO also pulled their guidance for the year, which was a big red flag.

They are now trading at a TTM P/E of 18, and forward earnings above 14+ (I keep getting different estimate numbers, but it seems estimates are being repriced). A bit high in my opinion for a retail brand that hasn't shown stable, consistent growth - *but also not entirely unreasonable* \- and they are coming in with a more positive outlook. The markets are hungry for equities and multiples on average are higher.

They did also have relatively high short interest at \~18% before earnings, which likely also contributed to the sustained price movement upwards with shorts covering their positions. The last short interest data I looked at was on Fintel from 8/29/25 - right before their earnings. Once 9/15/25 data comes out, could validate this assumption.

Overall, the huge run-up doesn't seem to be completely ridiculous. The stock was at depressed valuations with a lot of negativity priced in. Earnings came at a huge beat, hugely successful ad campaign, and upbeat outlook from management. The price is now at an elevated multiple (maybe a little higher than it deserves, but only time will tell), but is not out of the normal for where AEO has traded historically and is not absolutely farfetched (look below:)

https://preview.redd.it/n7w09xaxk0qf1.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=359535c2340cbffd059ce947d3cf5aca44b39d02

**NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY AEO MOVED THE WAY IT DID, WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT GAP?**  
  
First - I looked more into $GAP as a business. They‚Äôre much larger than AEO, generating nearly 3-4x their revenues. They also have a larger reach globally ‚Äì operating in 40 + countries. They also include multiple brands under their umbrella ‚Äì GAP, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The big driver for GAP is their attempt to reinvigorate their brand, which has been showing slightly positive results in 3/4 brands over the past few quarters.  
  
I wouldn‚Äôt say their plan has yielded anything overly positive - UNTIL their most recent KATSEYE ad. For those of you that are unaware, it has gone insanely viral ‚Äì similarly to the Sydney Sweeney ad, which is when I began looking into the stock for a potential beat / revised outlook on the brand. GAP collaborated with KATSEYE, which is a multicultural POP girl group that has been growing significantly in popularity with the younger demographic.

Their collab has already reached over 100M views on tiktok ‚Äì just the main video alone (when I first checked, it was at 90M - then 2 days later, it was over 100M). People have been remaking, stitching, re-uploading the ad and those videos have also hit many millions of views (some individual video remakes have hit 40M+ views themselves, and I‚Äôm sure I probably haven‚Äôt seen all of them). IG has over 60M views ,Youtube has over 20M+ views, the shorts video has 5M+ views.

If we compare that to $AEO's Sweeny campaign, GAP has vastly outperformed in viewership (and probably engagement) across all platforms. $AEO also did pull the main ad off their social media and the supporting ads are also in the multi-millions of views, but they still don't compare to what $GAP has done in a shorter period of time.

\***Note: I did this research last week so the numbers may have shifted higher. Just checking tiktok & IG alone - the main video alone is now at 133M views on TT and \~70M views on IG.**

GAP's vids on tiktok previously were only hitting anywhere between 10-100k views. I think the more recent ones that were towards the top left gained traction as they were closer to the actual ad debut - being brought up by the launch of the ad itself. When a video goes mega viral on a page, it typically lifts the views of the other videos as well.

There are also endless video remakes tagging $GAP & Katseye hitting insane numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/jogcin72l0qf1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=2504e259f6010f5ea29b1ba1dea4d7cad3572cc6

The ad became the most searched query on tiktok and was also mentioned on GAP‚Äôs earnings in late August. The CEO stated they reached over 8 billion impressions, which I believe was probably **understated** as it was likely gathered before the actual date of the earnings for the CEO's interview on Mad Money.

***NOTE - earnings came out 9 days after the ad was released and the Q2 earnings were reporting figures from August 2nd, 2025 - before the ad was released.***

**GAP HAD AN AMAZING AD, WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GAP'S UPCOMING NUMBERS?**

If we look at total sales as of FY 2024, GAP was about 22% of their sales (3.3b/15.1b). I couldn‚Äôt find the sales mix numbers on how much Denim they sell annually, but according to ChatGPT ‚Äì the expectation is that they sell between 10-20% of their revenues in Jeans. At a midpoint, we can extrapolate that GAP sells approximately $400-$500M annually in denim ‚Äì which I think is reasonable assumption.

Retail typically does not perfectly sell through all of their items, and GAP is not to be excluded from this observation. They'll likely have much more denim to sell beyond what they typically do, and in preparation for a large ad campaign - retailers often adjust inventory for this.

Since it's not easy to find concrete figures online about sales mix - let's use $AEO's earnings as an example to potentially gauge the impact the Katseye ad will have on $GAP. Quote from the earnings transcript ***""Sweeny Signature jeans sold out within a week and some products within 1 day. Demand for her curated online shop of Syd's Picks has been very strong.""***

Prior to their Q2 Earnings - Zacks' consensus estimate for AEO's earnings was $1.23b (about a 5-6% decline from the prior year), while their actual revenue was $1.28b (representing a \~1% decline YoY). This was a beat on revenue expectations of \~$50M. The decline expectations seemed in line with their Q1 report, which was quite depressing. The CEO spoke of all the new customers / eyeballs they got, how they plan on retaining and converting more of these new customers, and had an upbeat outlook going into the second half of the year.

So how can we think about this with GAP? The Ads are clearly different, but I believe GAP's strategic timing and content leveraged the controversy AEO created to boost their own campaign - **and it worked amazingly**. Aside from the screenshots shown above, IG has over 60M views, YouTube has over 20M views, and 5M views on YouTube Shorts - all platforms the Katseye GAP campaign has garnered more views & engagement while being up for a shorter duration of time.

According to GAP‚Äôs earnings call, their outlook is to grow Q3 at 1.5-2.5%. At 2%, this would mean an increase in sales of \~$72 million from Q3 2024. GAP had been teetering between decline and flat revenues in the past few years but has seen slight improvements in revenue growth due to their ‚Äúreinvigoration‚Äù efforts **BEFORE the KATSEYE ad** brought on an insane number of impressions to their business.  
  
Now after the Ad, it's blown any of their campaigns thus far out of the water - with reception from the Ad being overwhelmingly positive and garnered even more support as it‚Äôs been touted as ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù to do an Ad in comparison to AEO‚Äôs campaign. The ad itself is just much easier to talk about and spread in younger circles - what kids / young adults are going to be talking about Sydney's AE monologue over the dance and catchy song from GAP?

I believe their outlook (1.5-2.5% Q3 revenue growth) **does not meaningfully include the impact from the campaign becoming mega viral** as GAP had already been growing at similar rates in other quarters (2% increase YoY last Q3 and beat expectations by 2.5%, and similar to the past few quarters). This makes sense to me as well since the campaign launched only a week before the Earnings call.

From glancing at their website and using LLMs ‚Äì their denim products seem to average near $60 (they run sales / promotions often). Assume they sell $450M annually at an average $60 price point per item - that‚Äôs about 625,000 pieces of denim they sell monthly on a regular basis.  
  
Knowing they typically have excess inventory and that this was a large campaign, let's assume a similar number of new customers come to GAP as AEO (personally, I think GAP's campaign will probably be more effective, but won't know 'til Q3). On 700,000 new customers, I think it's a conservative guess to say a million additional items will be sold (about 1.4\~items per new customer), which would translate to about $60M in additional revenue. That alone would be about an additional 1% of revenue. If we assume less conservatively, we could see an additional 1.5-3% beat on top line revenue on their Q3 estimates.

Here are a few reasons why I think they may sell more than a million additional pieces:

* A segment of shoppers that will have purchased additional items outside of the KATSEYE specific products just from browsing the page / walking through the store and seeing other things they may like.

* Shoppers that bought multiple pieces / whole outfit sets ‚Äì we can see this just scrolling through something like Tiktok.

* The KATSEYE ad being on trend with younger consumers (catchy song, lyrics that are directly comparing themselves to AE and using it to their favor, easy to learn dance) and women/girls ‚Äì who are the primary target demographic, and this influencing them towards a brand. Even sororities are using it for rush videos, doing the dance in Denim, gaining tens of millions of views, and tagging GAP.

* The videos seemingly performing better in a shorter time frame. In the past 2 days I‚Äôve checked (These are not the latest numbers, I checked a few days ago, they are likely higher now): \*\***NOTE - this is from last week and checking today on 9/18 on just TT & IG quickly, the views have continued to ramp up**

   * Tiktok‚Äôs original GAP ad has already gained +10M views, reaching over 100M views now. AE‚Äôs main ad was pulled from their pages, but the remaining ads have around 2-8M views. GAP has supporting ads that have outperformed AE‚Äôs best ads.

   * Instagram‚Äôs original GAP ad gained +5M views, with over 60M views now. AE‚Äôs main ad was pulled, and the top residual ad has 12M views.

   * Youtube‚Äôs Video is at 20M views, shorts at 5M views. AE‚Äôs remaining ad has 8.8M views and 2.4M views on shorts.

* Q3-Q4 is historically stronger for GAP and retail overall

I also went on GAP and clicked into some of their Denim items and put in a Manhattan (10002) / California Zip code (90001), which gave me 40 GAP locations each, both areas were **out of stock for the products in store.** Earlier in the week, the shipping was **also out of stock**, but it seems it is once again available. I tried clicking multiple sizes, colors, and fit combinations ‚Äì and they all showed up as sold out in store. A lot of them were still not available online, though it does look like they restocked a bit. I also checked other zip codes like 73301 (Texas) and 60007 (Chicago). I did not have the patience to check all the products / zip codes in the world, but I saw enough that convinced me they are likely selling through the KATSEYE collab items. The first ones I found that were in stock was a ‚ÄúCrop Tank Top‚Äù, which you‚Äôd have to scroll down to find ‚Äì but seems like the denim items have been majorly successful.

With a potential revenue beat, and similar renewed optimistic outlook off the back of a wildly successful ad campaign that's even being studied in college marketing classes - it's a recipe for a nice turnaround retail story - the one GAP's been trying to tell for the past few quarters.

**GAP'S VALUATION & PRICE TARGET**

Like AEO before the Sweeney pump - GAP is trading under a 10 P/E and forward earnings of under \~11.5. This gives them **room to move** from both an EPS beat, and a multiple re-rating (similar to what we saw with AEO).

GAP has consistently beat EPS (past 10 or so quarters), meaning management has been diligent about costs / been much more conservative in their guidance.

Based on the current TTM earnings (2.34), a 12x P/E ratio would bring GAP stock up to \~$28. Average analysts forward estimates (\~2.07), a 12x P/E ratio would bring it to $24.84.  
  
Now this is not much upside on the stock, but as we have seen before - GAP has been consistently **beat** earnings expectations and being roughly on target with revenue expectations. **With the ad campaign, I'm expecting a revenue beat, which should help with an earnings beat** **(which I would have expected regardless of the ad campaign as stated above), meaning the $24.84 price target is unlikely and is not my target for the stock.**  
  
Then, if we consider that the stock may rerate based on a more positive outlook and that the P/E is already very low - we could very reasonably see a 13-15x P/E.

* At a 2.34 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $30.42 and 15x P/E would be $35.1

* At a 2.07 EPS, a 13x P/E would be $26.91 and 15x P/E would be $31.05

* Assume the forward earnings estimate beat by 5% (conservative beat) - that's a 2.17 EPS, a 13x P/E is **$28.21** and 15x P/E would be **$32.55**

I'm not delusional - I understand that this is a retail company that's been stagnant over the years - but stocks move when the future of a company looks better than expected. The valuation is low, expectations aren't out of the world, & a decent amount of shares short which may have to cover - which is great for a potential beat and subsequent stock price move.

**If sales and overall outlook improve off the KATSEYE campaign and they continue to beat EPS estimates like they have (boosted by an increase in sales) I would say a $28 price target is realistically achievable and good odds landing somewhere between $30-32.**

*TLDR:*

*- $GAP is trading at low valuations with low expectations and decent short interest, leaving less room for downside and more room for upside.*

*- They have an insanely successful ad campaign running currently for Q3, which has arguably outperformed $AEO's campaign. $AEO's campaign contributed to the stock moving 40% after earnings and had a similar valuation / expectation as $GAP now.*

My current position - may add more leaps:

* They‚Äôve missed a pile of SEC filings (Q3 2024, FY 2024 10-K, Q1 and Q2 2025). Despite this, NYSE is letting them keep trading.
* Lenders (Truist Bank and Omega) agreed to forbearance instead of forcing default. That usually means lenders think there‚Äôs value to preserve. Default was from technicality (PACS triggered ‚Äútechnical defaults‚Äù because of problems tied to its warrants and its compliance certificates to lenders, the warrant certificates provided to lenders were deemed ‚Äúdefective‚Äù or ‚Äúincorrect"" most likely due to the audit progress), not because they are out of money or something.
* Stock is trading around $12 while analyst price targets are $30+. If filings get cleared, re-rate potential is big.

* Additionally,¬†**the NYSE has also been repeatedly granting them extensions**, up until the final, November 19th 2025 deadline. This is¬†**bullish**¬†because the exchange would've frozen/kicked them out long ago if they were not showing reasonable progress on filing the delinquent filings.

We look forward to the Audit Committee completing its investigation as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities ahead to accelerate growth and drive value creation for all stakeholders.‚Äù*
* Their VERY SIMILAR competitor, who is slightly bigger, $ENSG, is trading at $160+ per share. This is incredibly undervalued, think of it as a very discounted version of $ENSG.

**What this boomer factory actually does**

PACS is a holding company investing in post-acute healthcare. Operations are decentralized: independent subsidiaries run the facilities day-to-day; corporate allocates capital, growth, and ops support. Current footprint: \~315 post-acute facilities across 17 states serving nearly 30k patients daily. The demand driver is demographics and acuity, not vibes.

Stock has been hammered and down since November 2024 where they were accused of fraud by a Hindenburg short report. Allegations have not been proven true to this day thus far. Company has been working with their independent auditors and possibly the government behind-the-scenes since then.

The company priced its shares to raise about $908 million, reflecting strong investor appetite for cloud security as enterprises continue shifting workloads away from traditional data centers.

Founded in 2012, Netskope built its reputation in cloud security, secure access service edge (SASE), and zero trust, markets forecasted to grow rapidly as businesses adapt to hybrid work and remote-first models. The IPO positions Netskope among top public cybersecurity players like Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.

The public debut is seen as both a validation of Netskope‚Äôs technology and a broader signal that investor confidence in cybersecurity remains strong despite volatility in tech IPO markets. Analysts note that Netskope will now face the challenge of balancing rapid growth with public market scrutiny.

1nkf4y4,wallstreetbets,$SNAP - Quick update. Rolled half my $7c -> $10c,"NFA, DYOR.

\---

I bought 1k leaps yesterday, upped to 3k after high level interactions with chat, and today rolled half my 7c's into 10c's. This one is incredibly undervalued imo. Some rough numbers

\---

\- 480,000,000 daily active users & \~932,000,000 monthly active users

\- 7% growth in MAU since last year

\- **over 5 billion Snaps are created every day**¬†as of late 2024. IE: the average DAU sends off more than 10 snaps every day.

\- Many users have streaks exceeding 1000 days, users are sticky

\- The target audience is mostly teenagers. As per GPT: ""The platform is particularly popular with younger demographics, reaching about 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds""

\- Still super relevant, mostly seemed ignored / not on anyones radar (literally 5% of people on earth use it daily tho). I suspect this is because the primary users are the younger demographic -- ie: most people 30+ I know are not using it.

\- Valued \~$20 - 30 / daily active user.

\- With a streak of 1000+ days, if each \*DAILY\* user is worth 2c / day, it's undervalued on that alone. That's like a single ad. As per above each daily user sends on average 10 snaps a day. I'm sure they can figure out a way to make more than 2c from this. You can probably get \~2 targeted ads be per person per day, assuming 10 snaps. I think it's gotta be worth more than 2c

\- Valued at $10 two months ago and was trading over $12 earlier this year.

\- Price dumped due to bug in advertising platform last quarter. It made all the revenues look \*really\* bad, so everyone dumped / panicked without looking at larger picture.

\- Positive feedback from advertisers (ie: they enjoy the experience / working with snap): https://parameter.io/snap-stock-rises-3-following-tiktok-ban-delay-and-positive-advertiser-reviews/)

\- Reinvesting heavily into their own business & still growing

\- Trading at an all time low despite all the rest

\- Some more due diligence in my other post from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap\_chats\_in\_im\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1njeymd/snap_chats_in_im_in/)

\---

Chat - why is this regarded? Why am I regarded? IMO this is easily over $10 by EOY. Change my view. DYOR

\---

Update:

To everyone saying ""SNAP IS DEAD""... you are so incredibly wrong. Snap is growing - quite quickly. It's actually (quite literally) \~20-30m DAU's from passing insta's DAU's. Users spend \~80b hours on the app per annum, vs \~100b hours on insta. To everyone saying they have never been able to make a profit & never will be able to - people said the same thing about reddit. Then they changed how ads are in the platform and it rocketed straight up. Snap has a ton of potential IMO -- they already solved the hard problems (make an app people / especially teenagers actually want to use)

1nkats2,wallstreetbets,YOLO into $UAMY monopoly,"I have never been confident enough in a stock to publish it like this, but based on the market UAMY has cornered, it's underpriced as fuck. Here's my shot at DD:

China cut off all antimony flows ‚Äî first with September ‚Äô24 export controls and then a full¬†ban to the US on Dec 3, 2024¬†‚Äî which choked supply to the West and prices soared. Europe has seen shipments freeze, and buyers are scrambling for non-China supply. It's important for ammo, solar glass, batteries, and IR/defense gear, and right now there is little supply for the West. 

That‚Äôs where¬†$UAMY¬†comes in. The¬†only primary/significant antimony smelter in the US. It's processed in Thompson Falls, Montana, and the US is still \~80% import-reliant for antimony. Now that China‚Äôs sale to the US is gone, the domestic smelter has a¬†US-processing monopoly.¬†

The kicker: antimony often rides shotgun with¬†gold¬†(stibnite).¬†Perpetua‚Äôs Stibnite Gold Project¬†in Idaho has \~148M pounds of antimony reserves and says it could cover \~35%¬†of US demand in its early years ‚Äî and DoD just threw more money at building a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain.¬†Perpetua and UAMY are working together on metallogical testing, setting up the ‚Äúgold mine byproduct to U.S. smelter‚Äù pipeline the Pentagon wants. If that matures, UAMY owns the furnace.

1nk9po1,wallstreetbets,Just hit ¬£500k - ALL IN ON HUT 8,"**Short background on my investing journey**

Started investing June 2020 with ¬£15k. Through pure dumb luck I‚Äôve turned it into ¬£500k. Started off just copy trading anything that was pumping on here. First big score was $NIO at $11, sold at $50. Then followed a popular poster in here at the time, SirJackalot into a certain banned meme stock and came out with ¬£300k.

Thought I was a genius, made life changing money doing all the wrong things, so I proceeded to nearly throw it all away losing money on every garbage piece of shit you guys shilled me. Wish, Baba, RKT, Palantir (yeah I even managed to lose on PLTR), CLF, every weed stock, you name it, I bag held it.

Went all in AMD (Hence the name) for 2 years of sideways pain, finally sold with a tiny gain. Which leads me to my current play HUT 8. Loaded up when market cap dropped below their BTC holdings after a short report in early 2024.

**HUT 8**

**AI/HPC Pivot**

Bitcoin mining is a dying business. Due to the halving, profits are halved every 4 years. Many bitcoin miners are pivoting to hosting AI HPC data centres, which provide more reliable sources of revenue. Even miners like Cleanspark who marketed themselves as 'The last pure play bitcoin miner' are discussing pivoting. These miners have been quietly scooping up cheap power for years and I believe this is not fully priced in and there is a lot of money to be made.

HUT 8 recently announced plans to develop four new sites across the US. Including a 1000MW data centre in Texas and a 300 MW called RiverBend in Louisiana which will be upgrading to 1000MW. Stage 1 for the Riverbend site is expected to be completed by Q4 2025. Therefore I believe an announcement for a deal with a hyper scaler is imminent.

HUT has a huge power pipeline of 10,800MW with 3100 MW capacity under exclusivity and 7700 Capacity under diligence.

**Bitcoin mining carveout (Creation of American Bitcoin)**

HUT 8 has gone into partnership with the Trump brothers Eric and Don Jr to create American Bitcoin ($ABTC). HUT 8 gave away all of their miners for an 80% stake in the company. HUT 8 has pretty much given away 20% of its miners for the Trump brand. Why would they do this? Like it or not the Trump name carries premium. The most expensive stock on the market is $DJT. $DJT is sitting at a $5B market cap despite only doing $1.3m in revenue so far this year. This is by far the most overvalued company on the stock market IMO. ABTC did a private raise worth $220m bringing in the Winklevoss twins which diluted HUT 8's share from 80% to 64% which puts the value at the time of the private raise just north of $1B. They then used the cash raised to upgrade their EH/s from 10 to 24.2.

ABTC has currently been public 2 weeks and as I currently sit here $ABTC is currently trading at $7.82 which puts the market cap at $7.1B and values HUT 8's 64% share at $4.5B despite HUT 8's Market cap being $4B itself while also holding 10k Bitcoin worth $1.2B on the balance sheet. ABTC is set up to be self funded and will be able to raise cash at absurd levels compared to what HUT 8 previously could without the Trump brothers while not diluting HUT 8 shares. I love this because I am extremely bullish on the AI HPC/ Energy Infrastructure side of the business and I don't want to be diluted to fund EH/s growth or the straight purchase of Bitcoin.",200,100,2025-09-18 14:24:28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nk9po1,2025-09-25 02:29:39.785260

1nk5cl8,wallstreetbets,HUGE Deal Between $INTC and $NVDA,"NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs and data-center platforms. Timeframe are TBD and current roadmaps with arm will not change, per sources, meaning NVIDIA will offer both.
¬†
Overall
¬†
‚Ä¢PCs: Intel will build and sell x86 SoCs integrating NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets
‚Ä¢Data center: Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA integrates into its AI platforms
‚Ä¢Financial: NVIDIA is committing $5B to Intel equity at $23.28/share
‚Ä¢Scope: Product collaboration‚Äînot a foundry manufacturing deal
¬†
Why it matters
¬†
‚Ä¢Windows/x86 PCs: Higher-bandwidth, lower-latency CPU-GPU coupling should lift AI inference and pro-app and gaming performance versus discrete PCIe designs. Data center: NVIDIA gains an x86 option alongside ARM; Intel attaches CPUs into NVIDIA‚Äôs fastest-growing AI platforms.
¬†
What we don‚Äôt know yet
¬†
‚Ä¢Ship timing, ramp cadence, and how many generations.
‚Ä¢NVLink specifics (bandwidth, flavor, coherence) and CPU-DRAM/GPU-HBM memory topology.
‚Ä¢Process nodes and packaging (EMIB/Foveros) for the PC SoC and the custom DC CPU.
‚Ä¢PC SoC scope (NPU, power targets, die/chiplet counts) and NVIDIA rack-level designs.
‚Ä¢Software stack details (CUDA/driver model on Windows/x86; Linux support).

**$NUVB (Nuvation Bio)** was founded in 2018 by **David T. Hung, M.D. Oncology biotech** developing next-generation **kinase inhibitors** for genetically defined cancers. In certain cancers, aberrant kinase signaling is **constitutively active (‚Äúalways on‚Äù)**, driving uncontrolled cell growth (tumors).

**Leadership** (see [here](https://nuvationbio.com/board-of-directors/))

* \~**70‚Äì80% technical/scientific** (MDs/PhDs in clinical, R&D, operations) vs. **20‚Äì30% commercial/operational** (finance, BD, legal).
* top education for all the technical people, past record of leading end to end pharmaceutical development
* James Bond villain Dr Sauvage is here.

Fun fact:

* past success: David founded Medivation, they worked on a drug called **Xtandi** and was acquired by Pfizer for \~$14B (2016).
* failure: David had a setback leading **Axovant** amid Alzheimer‚Äôs trial failures
* that failure is often not mentioned and is also part of the bear argument.

**Financial state of affairs**

statements are pretty clear in that regard:

* good cash reserve (already the case before commercialization).
* conservative estimates, taking out exceptional R&D acquisition, they can hold for 2-3 years without any dilution in the radar. they historically burns \~$40‚Äì50M per quarter so that's in line with what i am seeing on nasdaq
* confirmed by David during the few conferences in september and his CFO.

**If I say biotech you scream? ‚ÄúPipeline‚Äù**

Pipeline as seen on their [website](https://nuvationbio.com/pipeline/):

https://preview.redd.it/2a0ybu4k0tpf1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeda40b14157044bed2bb0b9f551277829e04754

The dream scenario: Good Safusidenib clinical results

* promising data with a strong clinical study as released during the HC conference (see data)
* q[2 earning report](https://investors.nuvationbio.com/news/news-details/2025/Nuvation-Bio-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Update/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com): ‚Äú*Discussions with the FDA regarding registration-enabling trials of safusidenib are ongoing, and the Company plans to provide additional updates in the second half of 2025.*‚Äù
* during HC, David **claim** that they are in discussion with the FDA to go for a Head-to-Head trial against **vorasidenib**
   * Clear intention of showing safusidenib superiority
   * They could capture a \~6B market if doing so moving their valuation by a whole bunch.

at this time, **i'll only care about Taletrectinib** (commercial name IBTROZI) for this analysis.

**taletrectinib** (the grim reality):

* **oral ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, FDA approved since June 2025.
* [In June 20](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nuvation-bio-nuvb-taletrectinib-selected-104653135.html), IBTROZI (commercial name for Taletrectinib) received ‚ÄúPreferred Option‚Äù in updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC).
* August earnings have shown a different [story](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuvb-sales-jump-1043-drug-launch): ‚Äú‚Ä¶. driving $4.8 million in GAAP revenue, well above GAAP revenue estimates.‚Äù
* Not only that: ‚Äú*According to the company, IBTROZI product revenue (GAAP) reached $1.2 million i****n just 13 U.S. business days after approval***\*, reflecting channel stocking and new patient start\*‚Äù
* \~$3.5M analyst‚Äôs revenu estimates.
* Long term data shows impressive improved PFS:
   * Patient who used IBTROZI saw better results especially when they haven't been exposed to other drugs.
   * Mild side-effects, pretty much whatever you see in all the medecines you probably have taken in your life.
* Competition:
   * [Nuvalent](https://investors.nuvalent.com/nuvalent-presents-pivotal-data-from-arros-1)‚Äôs rolling NDA (Sept 2025) approval **could** be **2026** (priority review) or later
   * When prompt about Nuvalent data, David debunked their studies: ‚Äú*putting 100 robots, letting them loose on a football pitch and watching just 3 of them cross the 22 yard mark and then claiming 22 as their median.*‚Äù

**Some math** (can skip this section if lazy or go straight to conclusion)

Simple revenue model for Q3. I like to be very very conservative. I want to estimate **Q3 revenue** for IBTROZI under **worst-case** adoption, without using early launch spikes (channel stocking, free trials) and **ignoring churn** (only next quarter).

* Let **r = paid starts per U.S. business day over Q3** (**D business days**).
* If starts are uniformly distributed across Aug‚ÄìOct, average contribution within Q3 is 2 patient-months per start (way below the current 13 on purpose)
* PM = 2 \* S = 2 \* r\* D
* **Q3 revenue** is then: *R = PM/Price = 2 \* r D \* Price*\*

Using:

* Price ‚âà $19.2k net/month (65% of the listed price)
* Three conservative adoption ceilings (the variable r): r = 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 **paid starts per business day**.

**Conclusion**:

* in the worst-case where we avoid early launch distortions and yield a conservative Q3 revenue range of **\~$1.15M‚Äì$3.83M (gross)**.
* intentionally, below \~$3.5M analyst‚Äôs estimates.
* analysts considered the worst case scenario without considering revenue outside the US.

**The bears üêªüåà**

the classical ones that you would see in pretty much every biotech company:

* **Commercialization risk**: management have no proven track record **launching an oncology drug at scale** in the U.S. (yes they did Medivation but it seems that success was too long ago for our lovely bear).
* Competition risk from NUVL, Pfizer etc. (imo this can be debunked as long as IBTROZI is *best in class*, granted this could change at any point in time)
* Pipeline uncertainty: unfortunately a very good argument. it is insanely hard to be approved, hence why my analysis is only on IBTROZI

in my quest for value, i am always on the lookout for additional insider activity.

**The bet**

* currently above and analyst estimates are not considering the market outside of the US (they get some juicy royalties in China).
* possible commercial distribution of IBTROZI in japan makes it attractive, in fact Sauvage current stock price is also not considering forward looking statements made by David during the HC Wainwright conference,
* in fact none of the news article even mentioned what he said.

you can check it [here](https://journey.ct.events/view/ea2e92e3-d524-423c-a68a-fe84140ac942).

David mentioned a few points of interests:

* forward looking statements like ‚Äúlooking forward to the Q3 earnings‚Äù.
* (random, totally bs 2cts) hearing him talk during previous earning calls he has historically been very conservative in his statements.
* Nuvalent study being bogus and not statistically accurate
* Going on a head-to-head trial

volume is somehow low (possible quick jump in price)

**fair value of this stock: 5-10$ easily**

my 6th sense when it comes to gambling my hard earned money, the competence of the management as well as the conferences makes me think that they will beat some kind of expectations.

especially as far as patient adoption is concerned and revenu estimation.

David, you know, could you go on an other buying spree like you did pre-FDA approval? that would be highly appreciated.

1njeymd,wallstreetbets,"$SNAP - Chats in, I'm in","NFA, DYOR

\---

Paperhands pick of the day. Really that simple chat - seeings a lot of this one and no bers. I do no research, I blindly follow the crowd. Buy now, DD later. Why is this a bad investment? Tell me it's horrible. Charts look like good entrance after a dip, 470m daily active users, 13b market cap, was trading over $10 literally 2 months ago. With tik tok rumors / stuff, perhaps this one has some upside too. No idea, I monkeyed in and am doing my dd later.

\---

Update: Tripled down today after posting + doing some DD with chat. As per GPT: ""A recent Snapchat advertising bug in Q2 2025 allowed some ads to be sold at significantly discounted rates, impacting the company's revenue growth and causing its stock price to fall"". Popular with the younger generation and revenue is going up (ie: growing).

Chat told me bug was fixed, it's popular with young generation & just saw a massive dip. I blindly trusted chat. 3k leaps. Max risk exposure for me.

\---

Update #2 (more DD): ""I coach a 13-18yr old basketball team at my ymca and every single kid uses Snapchat exclusively as their primary messaging app. No instagram or X. (In Texas)"". All the young people love / still use this one. More bullish than ever. This one is gonna have a meta moment.

\---

Update #3 (more DD / some handwaved numbers): Valued at like $20 / DAILY user and all users are teenagers. That's undervalued on that alone. I'm sure they can figure out a way to extract more than $20 in revenue from that market. Lots of people have streaks exceeding 1000 days. You just gotta make (quite literally) 2cents off a DAILY user a day to justify it. That's like a single ad. This one is hella underpriced

1njcfnv,wallstreetbets,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B üöÄ)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B üöÄ)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

1niqztt,wallstreetbets,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

https://preview.redd.it/x5czfktaukpf1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3bffb2eb74ed2ec58f453fe0f9f3fbede42f0e

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

For Example:  
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/second-quarter-2025-earnings-supplement.pdf): Credit Loans \~$50 Billions. Total Deposits \~$780 Billion

[Citi Group](https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/2025fsqtr2rslt.pdf): Credit Loans \~$110 Billion, Total Deposits \~$1.3 Trillion

[JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2025/2nd-quarter/ac6f00d5-6753-403a-94ca-87a0296fc28b.pdf): Credit Loans \~$390 Billion, Total Deposits \~$2.5 Trillion.

[American Express](https://s26.q4cdn.com/747928648/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-2025-Earnings-Tables.pdf): Credit Loans \~$133 Billion, Total Deposit \~$146 Billion (But their clientele is much lower default rate, and often do not use them for banking)

Even FDIC believes their loans are higher risk than stated: [link](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/capital-one-sues-fdic-overcharge-related-two-bank-failures-2025-09-11/)

and just today, they've adjusted their delinquency rate and charge offs. [link](https://ir-capitalone.gcs-web.com/static-files/e68bf5bc-6f01-4cff-8bfc-67aa1f087232)

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

1niobby,wallstreetbets,$MSTR: Setup for a Pop Tomorrow,"I‚Äôm eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock‚Äôs at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing‚Äôs basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed‚Äôs slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor‚Äôs debt buys cheaper, and it‚Äôs got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year‚Äôs cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It‚Äôs heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it‚Äôs on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor‚Äôs in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it‚Äôs rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.

1nik3on,wallstreetbets,$LDI - #derisk / unleverage -- now a freeroll,"TLDR: Risk profile changed - so sold calls, picked up 50k LDI shares as a freeroll, let it ride üöÄ

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

\[THE NEWS BELOW WAS FALSE / SPREAD BY BEARS FOR A BEAR RAID. SEE UPDATE 2\]

Update: Bought puts at EOD to hedge share risk (not posted). CEO sold all his shares today, saw this at \~4pm today (IE: AH, markets closed). That's all the bearish confirmation I need.  I'm fully out tomorrow / potentially short / puts. Goodluck chat

1nij58k,wallstreetbets,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it‚Äôs Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok‚Äôs US assets. If you think Larry‚Äôs not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY‚Äôs content library, you‚Äôve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers‚Äô screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   * ¬†PSKY‚Äôs market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney‚Äôs balance sheet.

**I‚Äôm no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER.¬†

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

1nhzrer,wallstreetbets,Nobody watching APLD,"Nobody on here is really talking about Applied Digital (APLD) and I think it has serious potential. The stock is sitting around 19.50 right now and it has already run over 70 percent in the last three months. What makes it interesting is not just the chart but the actual business story.

APLD is building out high performance data centers specifically designed for AI workloads. They already signed hosting contracts worth over 11 billion dollars, mostly with CoreWeave, which is one of the fastest growing names in the AI compute space. These are not small speculative deals either. They are long term leases that give APLD revenue visibility for years.

The company has about 200 megawatts of capacity now and plans to reach 400 to 500 megawatts by 2026. Each 100 megawatts can generate around 300 to 400 million in annual revenue. Analysts are projecting revenue to grow from about 450 million in fiscal 2024 to over 1.2 billion by fiscal 2026. That type of growth would support a market cap in the 3 to 4 billion range compared to about 2 billion today.

If AI demand stays hot and they continue hitting build out milestones, I think a reasonable short term price target is 25 to 27 by the end of this year. If momentum really catches on and retail wakes up to this play, I could see it testing 30. The risk is execution and concentration with a few clients, but the math lines up.

Right now everyone is watching NVDA and the mega caps but APLD is a pure play AI infrastructure stock that is still under the radar. I am betting it is going to get a lot more attention soon.",282,135,2025-09-15 22:09:49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhzrer,2025-09-25 02:29:41.919770

Paperhands buys first, does his DD later via shitposting in the daily. Here's some very high level due diligence. This company did \~30b in loans last year. It did \~100b in loans in 2020. It's a legitimate company and a large refinancer. The reason for the drop wasn't a failing business, it was due to rising interest rates. They refinance homes / mortgages. In rising rates - nobody does that so business looks bad. Interest rates are cyclic -- they will eventually come back down. When they do (not just 1 cut, but looking several ahead) these guys business booms as everyone wants cheaper mortgages. This can be doubly advantageous - lower rates (people remortgage) + potentially higher margins on the loans (depends how competitive they price things / where interest rates go). I chatted with a few people who have used them and they said they enjoyed the experience / using loandepots products. They advertise themselves as low friction, very quick with competitive rates. They operate in 20 countries, have \~5000 employees & a \~2b market cap. It was trading above $30 in the low interest rate environment circa 2021.

Lots of people worried about insider selling. It's a no story. CEO's compensation is primarily in shares and they jumped massively. I don't blame him for taking profits or derisking. We don't know why he sold. People said the same thing about OPEN (I was a bear also -- because insiders sold sub $1 and they tend to know stuff) -- and look where it went. Insider ownership is \~85% on LDI.

With not much additional DD, I bought more this morning. I haven't look at the finance sheet, etc - as it tends not to matter for my investment style.

1nhanqj,wallstreetbets,"+600k this weeks, thanks GLXY","Galaxy Digital was getting crazy undervalued the last couple weeks. Tons of extremely positive news on both the crypto side of their business and data center side. Looking to roll these into 2026's when they should get a portion of their 2.7GW understudy approved by ERCOT (on top of the 800MW they already have approved/leased) and leased out to a big hyperscaler like Oracle, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta.

If the full 3.5GW is approved and leased out at the same terms as their current CoreWeave deal, Galaxy could generate ~$5.25B/year in average annual revenues at 90% EBITDA margins (market cap Friday was ~$11B (@~$30/share), subtract their $3B balance sheet and you get ~$8B in equity value attributable to their crypto and data center business).

Think a fair price in the short term is $54/share (w/no additional approvals) and then gets into the $100's of dollars / share range if they can execute on their 3.5GWs + future power/site acquisitions.

I truly believe this is only the beginning of the journey and we are still so early. Just this week the senior management of the company met with 50+ institutions and I‚Äôm expecting we catch a bid in Q4, please keep in mind Galaxy has only been listed on the NASDAQ since the middle of May.

1ngsrhb,wallstreetbets,"DCF is actually a valid methodology, and it's working (on a longer timespan)","About 6 months ago, I posted about using the discounted cash flows (DCF) approach to value SOFI.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jhdnw2/modified\_discounted\_cash\_flow\_for\_sofi\_nasdaqsofi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jhdnw2/modified_discounted_cash_flow_for_sofi_nasdaqsofi/)

The DCF had predicted a price target of USD 20 per share, and I have made a good profit from buying both the underlying asset (at an undervalued price) and call options with the USD 20 strike.

Currently, the price is USD 26.55 (which may be overvalued now).

I think that market corrections are a real force, albeit not a very strong one, in a short span of time, but over a long enough period, prices tend to converge to their fair value (SOFI took less than 6 months!). However, it is also important to be careful not to inflate your assumptions too much when constructing the model.

Another case of DCF that could potentially indicate an undervalued (and ready to bounce) opportunity is LULU, but I'll need to go back and run the entire model before I come to that conclusion. By most valuation metrics (return on equity, P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA, P/B), LULU looks fairly undervalued and has a runway for an upward price swing ahead, but it is hard to know when (perhaps after two more quarters).

However, feel free to share your opinions below if you have concerns about using DCF as a way to gauge price direction in medium- to long-term.",29,45,2025-09-14 14:30:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ngsrhb/dcf_is_actually_a_valid_methodology_and_its/,2025-09-25 02:29:41.919949

Here the 8K: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001144879/000149315225013210/form8-k.htm

So APLD issued a $50M senior secured promissory note. The money is for acquiring the Polaris Forge 2 site and ‚Äúinitial improvements.‚Äù Interest is 8%  for 12 months (no cash interest; it accrues). The note carries a minimum 1.10x return to the lender. It‚Äôs secured by the Polaris Forge 2  assets. Mandatory prepayment is triggered when APLD executes one or more leases totaling 200‚ÄØMW for Polaris Forge 2 . If that doesn‚Äôt happen soon, the note matures Feb‚ÄØ1,‚ÄØ2026 (with other early‚Äëmaturity and event‚Äëof‚Äëdefault triggers).

The mandatory prepay upon signing 200‚ÄØMW of PF2 leases is a strong tell that APLD expects to execute that lease soon. **Companies don‚Äôt put short‚Äëfuse, deal‚Äëcontingent bridge notes in place unless they believe the trigger is near. Surprise surprise they drew up this document right after the town hall. They also released another letter saying deal imminent.**

1nfgxrf,wallstreetbets,Bessent is one of us.,"Bessent replied. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quoting Goldman Sachs, so‚ÄîI made a good career of trading against Goldman Sachs.‚Äù

Boasting about trading against GS must mean he obliterated them, after all he brags about his HF career every chance he can, well turns out that smug Ken lost 90% of the value of it's fund. Let this sink in 90%

As a money manager, Scott Bessent's years of inconsistent performance have contributed to a nearly 90% decline in his hedge fund's assets.¬†

When hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump‚Äôs Treasury secretary, left Soros Investment Management in 2015, he was able to¬†raise $4.5¬†to make his new firm, Key Square Capital, one of the biggest hedge fund launches ever.

Markets have¬†appluded the choice of Bessent for the cabinet post, but it‚Äôs not because Key Square has been a resounding success. By all accounts, Bessent had a stellar run as the Soros CIO for years, but by the end of 2023, his hedge fund had lost almost 90 percent of its assets from the peak: Assets had fallen to $577 million after reaching a height of¬†around $5 billions, according to news reports and regulatory disclosures. Reuters reports that Key Square‚Äôs fund lost money in  although the past two years have been big winners, as was 2024.

So the way to make $577 million is? start with $4,5 billion. Bessent is a reTard w hard T.

EDIT: The Dunning-kruger effect is well and alive, retard read article, retard gets butt hurt retard makes up shit that was not in said article. 

I said he lost 90% of the funds value, u fucking chimp, that is the AUM.

CAGR,sharpe and tracking counts for nothing when the fund actually LOST (this is a loss of capital ) all but 2 years since inception.

1nfbnu9,wallstreetbets,FLR vs SMR,"FLR has a market cap of $6.7B. Plus debt of $1.1B. ¬†I don't have the details of exactly how their ownership of Nuscale (SMR) works, but it appears to be massive, and held largely in the form of ‚ÄúB Shares‚Äù. They reported the value of it end of 2Qtr at $5B. Seemingly knowledgeable sources report Fluor‚Äôs stake in SMR at \~50%, and this squares with SMR‚Äôs quarterly disclosures regarding the non-controlling interests.

On the other hand, the share counts used by say Yahoo Finance to calculate market cap of SMR are not picking up the larges volume of B shares held by FLR. Yeah I know serious analysts will look through that, but dilution of a sort is coming as the B share convert to A 1-for-1. So maybe that SMR $4.4B market cap takes into account that only buys you half the company‚Äîor maybe not. After all, JOBY has a market cap of $12B, at an analogous point in an ""approvals lead"" based valuation.

Despite recent earnings weakness, FLR is a real business, with real revenues ($16B in 2024). The engineering business was earnings positive in ‚Äô24, although all of ‚Äô25 earnings have come from marks on the SMR position. But it sure looks to me like to that if you value the position in SMR (yeah not everybody does), you are getting the legacy engineering business nearly for free.

So I believe in small modular reactors (yes I own OKLO as well), and this is why I own FLR and not SMR. What am I missing?",12,5,2025-09-12 18:59:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nfbnu9/flr_vs_smr/,2025-09-25 02:29:44.056581

I believe the 2026 blockbuster movie slate is going to set records for movie theater revenues.  In addition to the Paul Thomas Anderson/Leonardo DiCaprio film ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù that is coming out September 26, 2025, check out what‚Äôs coming out in 2026:

The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2
Toy Story 5
Avengers: Doomsday
Dune: Part Three
Spider-Man: Brand New Day
The Mandalorian and Grogu
Moana (live-action remake)
A new Christopher Nolan film, The Odyssey

2026 could be the redemption arc for AMC just like 2025 has been for OPEN.

1nf3syp,wallstreetbets,Archer Plans For Air Taxi Trial Participation Under White House eVTOL Pilot Program With U.S. Airlines and Cities,"Today, Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR) announced it is aiming to participate in the White House‚Äôs newly established eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) alongside U.S. airlines, including United Airlines, and interested cities. This is the first federal initiative designed specifically to accelerate real world electric air taxi operations in the U.S.

Archer is now exploring pathways to work together with U.S. airlines, including United Airlines, and interested cities under the new program to design and execute trial operations of Archer's Midnight aircraft as part of the eIPP. The trials are expected to focus on demonstrating that eVTOL operations are safe, quiet and scalable‚Äîkey factors in building community trust and support for adoption of this new technology.

‚ÄúThis is a landmark moment for our industry and our country. We have an Administration that is prioritizing the integration of eVTOL operations in U.S. cities ahead of full certification in a pragmatic way. We‚Äôll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,‚Äù said Adam Goldstein, Archer Founder and CEO. ‚ÄúThese early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.‚Äù

Long story short, my position ran +103k in a day.  I sold at the close yesterday for $10.47 a share.

1nf1rqz,wallstreetbets,WBD - PSKY Merger Play,"Long time WBD bag holder. First bought post AT&T spin at $24 / share. Dollar cost averaged down throughout the dip, bringing average cost across 2,000 shares to $14.

Spent yesterday morning debating selling my shares and buying leaps after Zaz announced that the spin would be done by April. Low and behold, I think the IV is too high, decide I'll come back to it later.

Of course, five hours later, WSJ announces that Ellison is contemplating a bid, stock shoots up. I decide I want to increase my exposure, so I buy 50 10/17 $16 calls. This morning, I feel like I'm missing out on free money, so I decide to buy another 2,500 shares at $17.01

I strongly believe that Ellison will bid next week and that the price will be north of $24, in line with David Faber's report for the following reasons:

1. In the know media reporters like Kim Masters and Matt Belloni have been reporting for the past month that Ellison was contemplating the bid as soon as Paramount-Sky closed. They are amongst the most, if not the most, connected reporters in the space. If they're reporting, it's not BS.
2. Strategically, combining two legacy studios with sub-scale direct to consumer offerings makes complete sense. From a revenue perspective, WBD + Para is a much more compelling content offering than either on a standalone basis. Cost synergies would likely be larger than the projected $3B from the Para/Skydance deal. Feel really bad for anyone at WBD who doesn't work in a revenue generating role right now.
3. CBS likely protects WBD cable nets in carriage renegotiation, to the extent it still matters. With the loss of NBA, WBD nets were less need to have than before. NFL on CBS protects them in a combined company
4. Lack of a broadcast network makes the regulatory process less complicated as FCC does not have to approve license transfer.
5. Timing is critical and the time is now for the following reasons
   1. WBD is actively shopping the 20% stake in its Studio / Streaming business that is slated to be owned by the Global Networks business post-spin. If you want to own the whole thing, now is the time
   2. Zaz announced that the spin would be complete by April. If the spin completes, Ellison would have a lot more competition for the Studio / Streaming business (i.e. Comcast becomes a likely bidder and we all know how much Brian Roberts likes to insert himself in other deals)
   3. If at all possible, Ellison needs to get through the US regulatory process before the midterms. His dad is obviously super tight with the Orange Man. He can get this through now. Who knows what the landscape looks like in late 2026.
   4. WBD has a number of direct to consumer launches scheduled for early 2026. Getting in the door now enables Ellison to influence how / if they proceed (similar to South Park deal), minimizing the amount of unwinding he would have to do
   5. His dad's wallet got $60B fatter this week.

TL:DR - I believe the deal hype, expect a bid north of $24, and expect it will close.

Total position in WBD - 4,500 shares at average cost of $15.66 + 50 Oct 17 $16Cs at $0.94",51,50,2025-09-12 12:23:10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nf1rqz,2025-09-25 02:29:44.056699

1nesqr3,wallstreetbets,"DD on $BITF - A Speculative, But Undervalued Company with the Potential to be the Next Big AI/HPC Infrastructure Play","Hello fellow regards,

I am writing to you to inform you on the next best degen ticker for the most restarted regards. No financial advice here buddy, invest at your own risk.¬†

Before we get into Bitfarms (1W +70%, \~$1bn Market Cap) it is important to get some context on the current AI Infrastructure landscape.

* Nebius just struck a $17.4b deal, potentially rising up to $19.4b, with Microsoft to provide dedicated AI infrastructure over the next 5 years. Nebius rose 40% over the last week. Additionally, Q2 Revenue is up 106% quarter over quarter.
* CoreWeave, not my favorite play, but has $30.1b in revenue backlog and contracts with Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, and others. CRWV is up 187% since their IPO in March.
* Oracle has signed a $300b deal with OpenAI. Q2 cloud infra revenue is up 52% year over year. Oracle rose 38% over the last week.

This is just the start. There isn‚Äôt enough compute to go around, hence the high revenue backlog and exorbitant amounts of CapEx spending.

Now, where does BITF come in? This is supposedly just a BTC mining company. They have a proven capability of running profitable BTC mining data centers ‚Äì their direct cost per BTC is $48.2k while their revenue per BTC is $98k (an almost 50% margin per BTC).

I want to start by introducing the key risks before getting to my main investment thesis:

* What BITF don‚Äôt have currently is commited contracts/backlogs.
* Additionally, there is an execution risk (obtaining power, permits, building cooling, fiber, ensuring reliability, acquiring GPUs or equivalent hardware, hiring skilled staff).
* BITF has diluted shares in the past, but has completed a 4.9m+ share buy back.

So, I want to be clear, this is a speculative play for the most restarted regards. However, I do believe these risks will all be addressed.

Now moving on to my bulll thesis:

They have demonstrated a clear willingness to shift their focus towards AI/HPC infrastructure. I introduce the Panther Creek data center campus in Pennsylvania.¬†

* Pennsylvania is well known to be a haven for data center development. They are home to the PJM Interconnection (covers electricity market for 13 US states), so huge amounts of power at competitive pricing. Pennsylvania also generates tons of natural gas, nuclear and coal. In essence, PA offers abundant, low-cost energy, existing transmission, and favorable permitting as well.
* The Panther Creek DC is expected to have between 350 ‚Äì 410 MW with full capacity expected to be reach by 2027.
* T5 Data Centers is responsible for the buildout. This is a well reputed company in this space with 3 GW+ managed, 100% uptime since 2012, and 50+ data centers supported. ¬†
* In addition, they have secured additional prime data center land (Bitfarms Moses Lake Site) in Washington located in the largest data center cluster on the West Coast.
* Another key point is they have significant access to financing ($230m in total liquidity) to make this high CapEx spend a reality. $8m in monthly FCF generation ‚Äì this is almost $100m yearly and equivalent to almost a third of revenue.. Furthermore, they have secured $300m in debt from Macquarie (a bank focused on infrastructure finance). Also, they have their future non-core business of BTC mining to support CapEx spending.
* It is a value play ‚Äì yes, you heard me right. Yes, this stock also went up 70% over the past week. But BITF presents signifcantly lower multiples than comparable peers.
   * BITF with 2.9x TEV/Revenue LTM compared to CLSK (6.33x), CRWV (23.59x), IREN (8.65x)
   * TEV/Revenue NTM (next 12 months) at 1.65x for BITF compared to CLSK (3.31x), CRWV (9.95x), and IREN (3.36x)

Can BITF 10x? Yes, it can. Can BITF go to bag-holder land? Yes, it can. Invest at your own risk.

Have fun

Regards,

checazzo

1negxru,wallstreetbets,LoanDepot: A Fork in the Road,"Wtf is this company and what does it do? Loandepot is a retail mortgage originator and loan servicer that uses a tech-enabled direct-to-consumer arm. Think RKT, but way smaller. This company has a lot in common with OPEN, but it hasn't run up as much. Its current valuation and story make investing in it allows for a decent risk-reward play.

**The commonalities with Opendoor**:

They were doing relatively well while interest rates were low and houses were changing hands rapidly. By 2020, LoanDepot‚Äôs sales soared, surpassing $4 billion in revenue and employing over 12,000 people

The stock has been in the shitter ever since, especially with high interest rates freezing the housing market

Company focused on survival by bringing costs down via downsizing headcount, expanding revenue sources, and building upon their Mello platform. See: ‚ÄúVision 2025‚Äù

They are making pivots and have brought in changes in leadership, most notably bringing back their former founder, Anthony Hsieh, back as CEO

They‚Äôre losing less money and are on the path to profitability. In Q1 and Q2 2025, their net income loss was -71.5M and -65.9M, respectively. Compare that to Q1 and Q2 2025 at -40.7M and -25M.

With changes in macro/Fed rates, the leadership team, and changes in business plans/priorities, we might see strong upside in this company.

**A Fork in the Road**: How LoanDepot is different from Opendoor

Opendoor‚Äôs iBuyer model buys, holds, and flips homes; there is a significant risk of housing price swings, heavy capital is tied up, and there are thin margins. The company still has yet to prove that their business model in the future will work

LoanDepot has multiple revenue streams that don‚Äôt require as much capital to deploy: originating mortgages, in-house servicing, and other services (title, insurance, real estate referrals, HELOCs, yada yada)

The stock has gone up, but it‚Äôs still relatively early. Even if this stock doesn't have retail mania behind it, institutions might take a look at it because of...

**Catalysts and Game Plan**

Citron research has gone bullish on this company, giving it a $5 floor just for their SERVICING BOOK ALONE. Citron has made bad calls, but they also told everyone that RKT was also undervalued while it was trading at $11

Macro. Eventually, rates will go down. If not in September, soon. Trump will continue to pressure the Fed to lower rates, and he will screw with the BLS numbers to get it done

The company is finally pivoting from focusing on survival via Vision 2025, and now is implementing ‚ÄúNorth Star‚Äù, emphasizing better customer engagement (it already has a 70% recapture/retention rate, the highest in the industry), deeper integration of AI/automation, and being sustainably profitable.

Tech Focus: LDI rehired their original Mello platform architects to accelerate automation and AI to lower loan cycle times, lowering costs, and enhancing digital mortgages

**Bear case**

The company is still not profitable. They have to show that they can execute to prove they can turn the ship around. Luckily, they have a lot of runway with over $400 million in cash/cash equivalents, and they can also pull $1.2B as a line of credit, so the risk of dilution is low

They have strong competitors such as RKT and UWMC, who are profitable today. However, RKT‚Äôs and UWMC‚Äôs market cap is 46B and 11B, respectively, while LDI is sitting at 1.3B. Even with their recent run-up, it still has a lot of room to grow. If/when the housing market is hot again, they‚Äôll be enough business for everyone. Investing in LDI means you believe in their turn-around story

In the short term, the September rate cut may be priced in, which would partially explain its recent run-up

**TLDR / Conclusion**

Mortgage and housing stocks have been underperforming from the high interest rate environment, but the sector stands to gain a lot with rate cuts

The stock has transitioned from trying to survive to now focusing on making sustainable profits

They have enough cash and access to credit to weather out possible headwinds and become profitable again 

LDI has a lot in common with Opendoor, but LDI‚Äôs low market cap still makes it an attractive buy, especially considering their servicing book puts them at a $5 floor

The SP has gone up significantly already, but still has a lot of room to keep going, especially in this risk-on macro environment.

1nedg0a,wallstreetbets,The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

* With Oracle's recent MONSTER quarter, Larry Ellison is now the richest man on the planet.
* He and his son David (+ their investor group) collectively own 70% of PSKY.
* They control 77.5% of voting rights. His son has 50% voting control and Larry has 22.5%.
* They have 200 million warrants at $30.50. (Supporting Image attached)

Larry is worth $400B. This company is worth $7B. It goes without saying that he could sneeze and this thing would go up. The warrant price will be hit and Larry is known for never selling. These shares are in safe hands.

**Low Float**

With such high inside ownership, this is super low float. Way lower than it seems on website that only count the Class B shares. When this moves, it will move hard. We already saw that a few weeks ago when the first wave of shorts got blown out. There‚Äôs more where that came from.

**UFC Exclusive Deal**

PSKY just signed an exclusive deal with UFC. A UFC fight is going to be held on the Whitehouse lawn this summer. This is good for both subscription growth and meme-ability, Donnyboy will surely continue to bull post this with his good friend Dana White.

For high earners, will the Roth limit increase beyond the $8,600 for year 2026 for those 50yo+? For example, 50yo with earnings below $150,000 will have a Roth max of $8,600 (standard $7,500 + catchup $1,100), but higher earners will have a higher limit, because catchup contributions that were previously pretax get added?

1npncdh,investing,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035.

1npm4f4,investing,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet ‚Äúpicks & shovels‚Äù winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I‚Äôd set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn‚Äôt just another contract manufacturer anymore; it‚Äôs becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don‚Äôt improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI‚Äôs next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI‚Äôs future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody‚Äôs hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I‚Äôve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That‚Äôs based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",10,5,2025-09-24 19:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945085

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

P.S. if your suggestion is yes I can try, then I might start with just a little amount first.

What does this mean for the public market?","My take is that while major tech stocks are hitting new highs, the venture capital ecosystem that feeds the public market is actually quite fragile. I've been seeing and hearing about a severe bifurcation of capital and opportunity, and the numbers are pretty jarring.

1) ‚ÄãAI is dominating the market, accounting for 55.2% of year-to-date deal value.

2) ‚ÄãThe concentration of capital is extreme. The ten largest funds are capturing around 43% of total commitments, while overall fundraising is tracking toward an eight-year low.

3) ‚ÄãLate-stage AI startups are trading at a significant premium, with the median Series D+ pre-money valuation for AI startups approximately three times higher than their non-AI counterparts.

‚ÄãThis intense focus on a narrow sector, while the rest of the market struggles, feels like a potential risk. It makes me wonder if the current market rally is sustainable or if it's masking a deeper liquidity problem.

1noza1w,investing,"Friends suddenly getting into investing, red flag?","I (27M) have been into investing since I was 18. I have friends across different age groups, countries, and financial situations. They work in a wide variety of industries and have very different incomes. Since investing is one of my hobbies, I often bring it up in conversations. Some of my friends invest heavily, some just do the classic ‚ÄúVOO and chill,‚Äù and the majority have never cared about investing at all.

In the past six months I have noticed a shift. A lot of those friends who never cared before have suddenly started showing interest. They are watching YouTube videos about finance, and some have even paid for courses on things like evaluating companies and looking at P/E ratios etc.

On one hand I think it is great, financial education is important and learning how to manage money in your 20s and 30s is crucial. On the other hand I have noticed a concerning pattern. Many of them seem very impatient, which is normal for beginners ( I even consider myself beginner after 9 years investing), but they also sound greedy. Instead of starting with safer, long-term strategies like index funds, they are diving straight into riskier plays such as Chinese markets, emerging markets, and individual stocks.

To me this feels like a red flag that people is getting greedy and market is overvalued. I cannot help but think this behavior might be a stronger signal than any market metric.

1noqbel,investing,Powell Spoke Today ‚Äì Here‚Äôs the Vibe Check,"The economy remains vibrant, but showing some signs of fatigue. Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued.""

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we‚Äôll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn‚Äôt blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

**Who are the top contenders in each area in your opinion?**

I imagine it has to be a company that has appetite for experimentation/innovation. I imagine some will be private cos.",40,34,2025-09-23 16:43:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nomhws/sam_altmans_new_blog_post_who_are_the_infra/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945317

I have just noticed that there is a new ETF IE000FJJZA01 (since Dec 2024) that tracks S&P 500 Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats.  
Comparing the quality metrics, SP goes for Free Cash Flow metrics (FCF margin = FCF / Revenue; FCF ROIC) and MSCI to standard metrics (ROE and Debt to Equity).

Cash Flow seems more a transparent metric and less manipulated with accruals and so on by the companies when comparing to ROE and others  
Do you have the same perspective?

I am actually building a factor portfolio and I am looking to add one of this in order to reduce a bit the volatility.

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

Knowing all that, how do think I should set up the new ROTHs?

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

1no05ld,investing,Oklo Breaks Ground on First Aurora Powerhouse,"See link for today‚Äôs live reporting by Fox News at Idaho National Labs: https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6379935505112

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs (DOE‚Äôs) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE‚Äôs newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*‚ÄúOklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,‚Äù said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ‚ÄúAs advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we‚Äôre seeing under President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs American Energy Dominance Agenda.‚Äù*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*‚ÄúThis opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,‚Äù said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. ‚ÄúWe have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,‚Äù said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America‚Äôs largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit‚Äôs extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70‚Äì80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*‚ÄúINL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,‚Äù said INL Director John Wagner. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.‚Äù*",18,2,2025-09-22 22:09:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945448

I want to get my mother more in the mindset of just investing into one etf instead of trying to buy individual stocks since she isn‚Äôt the most technologically inclined and she doesn‚Äôt do the most research imo.

I am here to ask if the one etf to invest in would still be the commonly recommended VOO,QQQ, or VTI or if her having a shorter timeframe for how long she can invest changes what options would be best.

She took a look at my portfolio and saw I had. Decent amount of SCHG and just bought some of that on her own as well.

I was originally going to take out about a 30% margin loan and invest it in a real estate syndication with a stated IRR of about 20%. I soured on the syndication, but like the idea of finding something to arbitrage. For those who use margin (or SBLOCs), is buying an ETF index like VOO or VGT advisable with the margin account? I was also thinking about using it for a different real estate or other Reg D syndication to give diversification but am a little spooked on those. Note that the taxable brokerage account is already all VOO and VGT and there are IRA accounts having those same, and and also slightly more stock diversification.

1nnytkk,investing,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer‚Äôs market.

It‚Äôs very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It‚Äôs a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald‚Äôs, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people‚Äôs lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they‚Äôll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn‚Äôt a flex anymore, it‚Äôs cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that‚Äôs worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn‚Äôt coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn‚Äôt care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn‚Äôt even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they‚Äôre too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.",0,1,2025-09-22 21:14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnytkk/my_predictions_for_2035_what_will_be_a_goldmine/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945500
1nnyjfw,investing,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully. It feels like the future of investing is moving in this direction, but I am still curious to hear whether others think it should guide decisions directly or simply provide data that we interpret on our own.",0,6,2025-09-22 21:03:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnyjfw/should_we_trust_ai_with_our_investments_researches/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945504

1nnti8f,investing,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+.

1nnpoxo,investing,Is AI the Future of the Stock Market and Investing? And is it Smart to Invest in AI now or in a Few Months?,"I can‚Äôt wrap my head around AI and how it will impact the future of the Stock Market and investing. AI is rapidly growing and becoming more smarter each day. People are starting to use AI more and more in their day to day lives, however many companies are starting to incorporate AI into their systems and software to help make them generate more money. I do believe AI is the ‚ÄúNext Big Thing‚Äù when it comes to investing and even the real world. Just alone in the past 2 Years, AI has advanced and grown a significant amount and is only proving that it will continue to do so. I have my eye on two stocks that have been doing very well, TSMc and NVDA. Both of these companies work together and have a good relationship, and they both heavily rely on each other. TSMc manufactures and produces these H20 chips which are directly correlated to powering AI. As time goes on AI will become more powerful and will be of use a lot more which will create more demand. I have a TFSA open (opened January 2024, and I have invested the maximum allocated limit ($7000 CAD a year) I have invested all of the money that is in my TFSA into ETF‚Äôs as it is one of the safest ways to invest and watch the money grow rather than depreciate because of inflation. In January 2026 when I can invest another $7000; I want to invest it all into AI. I was thinking of putting $3500 into TSMc and $3500 into NVDA. Both of these companies have been doing very well, and I do believe they will continue to do so. Is this a fair statement; and is it smart to invest in AI? I have played it safe in the last few years with putting all of my savings into ETF‚Äôs, but now I want to take a bigger risk with the possibility of great return.

1nnk8wj,investing,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	‚Ä¢	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	‚Ä¢	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	‚Ä¢	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	‚Ä¢	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	‚Ä¢	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	‚Ä¢	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	‚Ä¢	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They‚Äôre growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

‚∏ª

CREAL (2998.T)
	‚Ä¢	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	‚Ä¢	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	100% annual net income growth
	‚Ä¢	54% gross profit CAGR
	‚Ä¢	GMV +93% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Net margins improving each year
	‚Ä¢	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	‚Ä¢	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	‚Ä¢	A true ‚Äúsubscription/toll bridge‚Äù style business in the making.

‚∏ª

Loadstar (3482.T)
	‚Ä¢	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	‚Ä¢	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	‚Ä¢	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	‚Ä¢	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	‚Ä¢	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

‚∏ª

Good Life (2970.T)
	‚Ä¢	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Net income up 48% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 44% YoY
	‚Ä¢	ROE ~29%
	‚Ä¢	PE ~11
	‚Ä¢	Share buybacks in 2025
	‚Ä¢	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

‚∏ª

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	‚Ä¢	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	‚Ä¢	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	‚Ä¢	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	‚Ä¢	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	‚Ä¢	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

1nnfyrl,investing,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking‚Ä¶ yeah right, here‚Äôs that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m.¬†So that acquisition price is over 13x last year‚Äôs revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica‚Äôs forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‚Äò80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts‚Äô according to EnSilica‚Äôs trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April.¬†*Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica‚Äôs is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic‚Äôs ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica‚Äôs. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‚Äòs forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it‚Äôs anticipated medium term sales projection of c.¬£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of ¬£500m+. That‚Äôs 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica‚Äôs IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST‚Äôs BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union‚Äôs forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica‚Äôs IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica‚Äôs share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example.¬†

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

May fortune favour the brave!",18,20,2025-09-22 07:24:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnfyrl/why_ensilica_is_worth_possibly_13x_its_current/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945666
1nnf3pl,investing,NVIDIA and Intel Just Partnered. Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take?

1nnd9am,investing,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

What do folks think of this analysis? Make sense, or something is missing?",334,142,2025-09-22 04:40:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnd9am/why_gold_is_about_to_take_a_stton_of_power_from/,2025-09-25 02:29:45.945694

1nn8s2u,investing,The reason I‚Äôm shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I‚Äôve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley‚Äôs are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley‚Äôs. When economic conditions are rough, there‚Äôs not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn‚Äôt be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is ‚Äúmotorcycles are dangerous‚Äù. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything‚Äôs great until it isn‚Äôt and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

1nn2eed,investing,Would you keep 40% of your portfolio in AMZN to avoid capital gains tax?,"I've vested Amazon shares over the years and I sell to cover then leave them in AMZN. I have that portfolio of 100% AMZN, and another one that I actively manage which is about 40% SPY, 20% bonds and gold, and 40% in individual stocks. 

I ran the numbers and, when both portfolios are combined, 40% of my holdings are AMZN. 

My AMZN portfolio is +30% overall. I know I'm overweight in AMZN due to the shares given to me. I want to sell about half of the AMZN shares and put that money into SPY and bonds. 

About half of the AMZN shares have been held over a year so its short term capital tax, the other half last than a year. That doesn't really matter as I would sell ""first in first out"" if I redistributed some of AMZN shares. 

Given the tax implications, what's a sound strategy I should do? Continue holding all AMZN in my one port? Sell a portion and redistribute?

1nmnmh3,investing,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, ‚Äúaccessible luxury‚Äù) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I‚Äôve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU‚Äôs demise, I thought ‚Äúoh course!‚Äù (hindsight‚Äôs easy, huh?) and began thinking who‚Äôs next? While already down bad this year, I can‚Äôt help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle‚Äôs Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don‚Äôt know where they can turn. I don‚Äôt trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with ‚Äúhealthy options‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh ingredients‚Äù, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they‚Äôve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clich√©d. Their complacency isn‚Äôt deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we‚Äôre at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we‚Äôve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we‚Äôre seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing‚Äôs for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",21,5,2025-09-21 09:34:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,2025-09-25 02:29:47.343973

So I've been investigating for a few years now, various ETF's, GICs, some stocks,  an TFSA and RRSP but I'm finally starting to see a bit of profit on some of my more ""gambly"" stocks. 

My GICs, RRSP and TFSA are long term, regular contributions and forget but I have a few stocks that I put $10-25/pay cheque into just as a bit of a personal attempts at making a bit of profit. It started off with cannabis stocks (I'm Canadian) years ago and I got burnt. Not a huge deal tbh since it was something I considered a bitmof a gamble. But the last year I've actually started to make a bit of profit. 

One for example, a gold mining company is up 84%! The last month it's been hovering around the $30 mark, up from an avg of $17. All indicators and reports I can find are pointing to this being a stable and good buy for the near term.

I'm trying to find guidance on when to sell and when to simply hold for the long term. 

It's not that I need the money right now but it might be nice to pay down some debt or maybe put it onto my mortgage. Or hell even to sell and put the money into a new sub $20 stock and try to grow it from there.

1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that‚Äôs what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don‚Äôt even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody‚Äôs reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",7,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm58pv/opening_discussion_about_rddt/,2025-09-25 02:29:47.344074
1nm2vdm,investing,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

‚∏ª

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking ‚ÄúWhat did I just read??‚Äù Let‚Äôs bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia ‚Äì More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

‚∏ª

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

‚∏ª

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor‚Äôs efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn‚Äôt effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don‚Äôt have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

‚∏ª

Possible Growth:

	‚Ä¢	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	‚Ä¢	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	‚Ä¢	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	‚Ä¢	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

‚∏ª

Company Financial Health: Strong

	‚Ä¢	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	‚Ä¢	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	‚Ä¢	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

‚∏ª

So we have a lot of potential here but let‚Äôs not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

‚∏ª

Major Risks to Consider:

	‚Ä¢	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	‚Ä¢	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	‚Ä¢	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	‚Ä¢	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	‚Ä¢	Cramer likes the stock

‚∏ª

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",1,21,2025-09-20 16:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,2025-09-25 02:29:47.344104

1nlzp7t,investing,Where to invest at the end of Oct,"My wife and I normally save 4K per month after all retirement, HSA, bills, etc. That fluctuates a little on months we take a big trip but fairly consistent. We have a 6 month emergency fund. 

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks. 

Should we stick to the 50-25-25 plan we have with just more money, take an opportunity to start a new investment (VOO or similar), stash more in cash, YOLO on 0dte calls/puts? What would you do based on the current market conditions?

1nltg3d,investing,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I‚Äôm doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I‚Äôve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I‚Äôve never had much of a strategy, I‚Äôve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I‚Äôve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in ‚Äúcore‚Äù growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in ‚Äúmoonshots‚Äù like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR.

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I‚Äôm up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it‚Äôs becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

1nljtmn,investing,Gold and market discussion,"I am looking to have a discussion with others on here about gold and it's current role and value in the market.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.
2. Current administration is trying to weaken the US Dollar which drives up asset prices, including gold.
3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.
5. Central banks buying up gold.
6. Central banks and investors have slowed purchasing of US treasuries signaling moving away from US assets.

Cons:
1. Gold does not generate income.
2. Possible that inflation does not accelerate.
3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto? 

Anyway, just here for healthy discussion about the market outlook over the next year or two.",7,5,2025-09-20 00:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nljtmn/gold_and_market_discussion/,2025-09-25 02:29:47.344232

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

Anyone with experience in emerging market REITs? Regulatory changes like this usually precede bigger investment waves, but India's property market has its own unique dynamics.

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

1nlcpmw,investing,Market Returns vs Inflation  (Do I have this right?),"Simple question, and I should know this, but asking here:

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

1nl5thw,investing,Stock allocation in retirement?,"I recently retired early,( just before 6o). I claimed survivor benefits for now and that's why I made the move. The survivor SS benefits almost covers basic expenses, (almost). I would still need a few grand from investments just to cover everything. That's the basics.

I have a meager sum invested - 85% Index and 15% fixed -bonds/ MM. This gives my about 5 years of additional supplemental funds from investments without touching the equities. Soon after that I will switch to my full SS benefit that should more than cover expenses plus a moderate surplus. One goal is to draw as little as possible  from investment, letting it grow until my FRA at 67 (perhaps even 65) I have a high equity allocation because the early retirement left me with less savings then I had hoped.

What is my risk here? Is a lower equity allocation at the start of retirement all physiological to alleviate stress during downturns?How much real risk do I have. I do plan to drop to a lower allocation around 70, and after I switch to my SS ( 65-67) the investment income would no longer be needed to cover bills, but would be nice for extras!

1nkvpz0,investing,How would you invest to benefit from the fall of Visa/mastercard networks?,"I recently learned of the Qris system, a system that doesnt use traditional payment networks and goes through indonesia's central bank and the use of e-wallets, products are purchased via QR codes and it seems to have already expanded to multiple Asian countries. One of the core benefits here is also the fact that the fees are minimal, transactions are instant and its completely independent of VISA/Mastercard networks.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance. And people are also politically motivated to find alternatives due to all the censorship those payment networks are pushing for.

Those systems are cheaper, convenient and independent of american payment networks, this kinda suggests that their takeover is inevitable and eventually the visa/mastercard wont be as relevant.

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.  However, RDRAM was poorly received by both consumers and memory makers due to cost and some technical issues and resistance from the memory makers.

After a series of legal setbacks, failing to win infringement claims, losing an anti-trust lawsuit, and having to face a politically motivated FTC investigation, the stock price crashed and traded in the single digits.

It's been a long, slow recovery.  I think it's safe to say that most investors from that time eventually gave up on the thought that the share price would ever reach 100 again.  So forgive me for being a little  excited, but today represents a landmark for me.  I just hope it can stay above 100 longer than it did before !

1nkk2xz,investing,Front loading 401k contributions then 401k loan result in higher contribution?,"Let me know what I'm missing here...

Let's say you were gainfully employed at a high paying job and maximized your 23.5k contribution half way through the year.

Then, you take out a 401k loan with a 8% interest rate that you pay back to yourself...

According to Empower, the 401k loan does not result in your funds being taken out of the market - it just adds the debt.

Doesn't this allow you to contribute more than the max contribution into your 401k? The origination fee for the 401k loan at Empower is only 50 dollars...

Paying the loan plus interest back into the account would theoretically allow you to exceed 23.5k in total contributions since the loan interest does not count against the limit",21,40,2025-09-18 20:54:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nkk2xz/front_loading_401k_contributions_then_401k_loan/,2025-09-25 02:29:47.344432

Ideally it would be able to retain investment in broad range of global market equities. 

Must be remote accessible and very secure. 

Dollar value less than $10M.

Not bitcoin or other crypto. Already have that sorted.

1nkb75f,investing,Should I consolidate my (2) 401ks into a single IRA for more flexibility in the future,"Hello all,

Currently, I am 57 and will stop working when I'm 60. I have two 401k's (one active and one from an old job) that should have a combined value of about 750k when I stop working.  I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

Right now the two 401ks have a variety of funds within them. The older one is a Gov TSP with C, S and I funds, while my active 401k is mainly Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap ETF's.  Do you think it would be ""easier"" for her in the future to have all our pre-tax money in a single account, spread across a couple stable ETF's vice how it is now?  Also, having never done anything like this before, is it a pretty simple process to transfer 401k balances into an IRA?   

Lastly, I assume that I cant simply bring over the same particular ETF's that I currently use since they are ""company managed"" (not sure if that's the correct terminology)  so would i just liquidate all the funds into cash and then transfer the balance into the IRA and go from there?

1nk32sg,investing,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it‚Äôs sitting near $20. That‚Äôs not just meme momentum it‚Äôs tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn‚Äôt even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

1njurb9,investing,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

1njrayk,investing,LXRX at $1.08  Is there a reason not to buy?,"Hey everyone,

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I‚Äôm seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That‚Äôs a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA¬Æ) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They‚Äôve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they‚Äôre gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that‚Äôs had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that‚Äôs a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

**So, anyone see a reason not to buy at this level?** Could LXRX be the under-the-radar biotech that finally delivers for investors, or is it still too early to tell?",0,19,2025-09-17 22:28:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njrayk/lxrx_at_108_is_there_a_reason_not_to_buy/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093125

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut.¬†

1njhk2x,investing,"I usually don‚Äôt sell this fast, but after a 57% gain in 5 months in Oil-Dri (ODC) I closed the position. The company‚Äôs great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn‚Äôt as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a ‚Äúquiet compounder‚Äù hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat‚Äôs Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn‚Äôt caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year‚Äôs inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC‚Äôs sales into that sector were up, they‚Äôre winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat‚Äôs Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat‚Äôs Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail ‚Äúdoors‚Äù for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They‚Äôre doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The ‚Äústeal‚Äù at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there‚Äôs still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I‚Äôd rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I‚Äôm still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I‚Äôll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

Curious what the sub thinks: do you trim or exit when a small-cap rerates quickly? Anyone else follow ODC or other under-the-radar compounders like this?

1njforb,investing,Should I diversify 10% of my long-term portfolio into gold or a global ETF?,"Hi everyone,

So right now 100% of my (small) long term portfolio is invested in QQQ. 

I‚Äôm considering diversifying  allocating 10 or 20% of my portfolio either to:

* a gold ETF (**GLD, IAU** or **SGOL**) , or
* a global index ETF, such as **URTH**, **ACWI**, or **VEA**.

I‚Äôm concerned that all of these assets look pretty overbought at the moment but the plan is to hold this allocation for a decade.

**Question #1:** What would make more sense:

\- To diversify with gold as a hedge, or 

\- To diversify with a world index ETF to balance exposure across regions and sectors. or 

\- To add more into the QQQ

**Question #2:** Would it be better to wait for a pullback before reallocating?

1njdniq,investing,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

Unless you think I'm underestimating the risk of sticky inflation?",0,8,2025-09-17 13:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njdniq/bubble_worries_have_sparked_my_interest_in_a/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093277

1nj9zwu,investing,How do we feel about ACHR,"Archer Aviation is down about 35% from its highs earlier this year

I‚Äôve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven‚Äôt added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I‚Äôve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They‚Äôre making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They‚Äôre also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they‚Äôve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.

The stock‚Äôs trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren‚Äôt guaranteed.

1niqq2t,investing,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I‚Äôve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I‚Äôm also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we‚Äôre now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I‚Äôm ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I‚Äôm not savvy enough to know if it‚Äôs going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I‚Äôve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I‚Äôm betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I‚Äôd like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT‚Äôs right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF‚Äôs

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF‚Äôs as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.

1nih5qo,investing,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you‚Äôd expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn‚Äôt happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released ‚Äì it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.",0,6,2025-09-16 13:14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nih5qo/defying_the_news_why_do_prices_sometimes_move_in/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093517

Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

1nid949,investing,"AI Enthusiasm in Stocks: Records Despite Yields,Your Offset Pains?","The recent rise in AI stocks, which has reached record highs, feels like a real struggle. On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you‚Äôre significantly up, and the next you‚Äôre down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

* [**VTI**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/) (70%)
* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance.

I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

I'm looking forward to hearing some feedback about my new portfolio, especially if you have also looked into factor tilting before or have already added one or two factors to your portfolio.

I did my first year of university but I want to switch my major and drop out of my current university. If I drop out right now I'd only get a 50% refund from my school meaning I need to pay around 1.7k And Id need to pay my 5k loan back on top of that (if I don't drop out I don't need to pay that loan back for another 2 years) 

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job?

1ni43qb,investing,Rate Cut Bets - It's Turning Out to Be a Close race with Cook and Miran in the pole Positions,"It looks like the handicappers had two bits of breaking news tonight. 

First,   cook will not be fired for now [Appeals court declines to let Trump remove Fed Governor Cook](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/appeals-court-declines-to-let-trump-remove-fed-governor-cook/ar-AA1MBYDE?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

Second  Trump will get his handpicked nominee on the board in time for the meeting tomorrow. [Trump Economic Adviser Miran Gets Senate Nod to Join Fed Board](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2025-09-15/trump-economic-adviser-miran-gets-senate-nod-to-join-fed-board) 

That will mean that the odds of a fed rate cut have gone up. Even though the Trump loss on the firing of Cook means that she won't be sidelined, there was really no indication of how she would have voted. On the other hand Miran's opinions on the matter are pretty clear, even if one doesn't think he is a trump lackey. 

However, in both the shorter term and the longer term, it's not clear how things will work out. If the Trump supreme court upholds his right to fire at will which it has done in all the other cases, then he will still be able to stack the deck in short order. (and maybe intimidate the other governors).

1ni2rm2,investing,Financial advisor broker - should I fire,"I've been with the same advisor for the past 14 years, and my portfolio has done fairly well over the years. Have seen people with way more performance, but overall I've remained in the green (except for a few big downturns).

I reached out to both advisors (partners) in May to invest the cash reserve part of my portfolio (16% is cash - and I wanted to invest about half of that), and they didn't respond and I forgot about. Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made. On the flip side, I do see that there could have been losses / or it could remain flat as well, but I wanted to take my gains and move into another company that I see a lot of potential in.

1ni0ifz,investing,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,investing,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations ‚Äî which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change ‚Äî are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",79,33,2025-09-15 18:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093716

1nhomjt,investing,LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk high reward biotech company,"Hello r/investing true to my name I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

‚∏ª

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking ‚ÄúWhat did I just read?‚Äù I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia ‚Äì More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

‚∏ª

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

‚∏ª

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor‚Äôs efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don‚Äôt have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

‚∏ª

Possible Growth:

	‚Ä¢Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	‚Ä¢Target population of the US is 128 million people

	‚Ä¢A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	‚Ä¢The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

‚∏ª

Company Financial Health: Good

	‚Ä¢Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	‚Ä¢Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	‚Ä¢This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

‚∏ª

So we have a lot of potential here but let‚Äôs not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

‚∏ª

Major Risks to Consider:

	‚Ä¢They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	‚Ä¢They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	‚Ä¢I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	‚Ä¢It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	‚Ä¢The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	‚Ä¢Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	‚Ä¢Short Interest is 30% ‚Äì it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

‚∏ª

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

Again this is high risk and although my name would lead you to believe I only hold small cap. Majority of my own funds are in diversified ETFs.

1nhmcfe,investing,Thinking About Investing in Silver ‚Äì What‚Äôs Your Take?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I‚Äôm curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It‚Äôs both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it‚Äôs seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn‚Äôt provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I‚Äôm wondering: do you guys think silver is a smart play right now? Would you go for physical silver (coins, bars), ETFs, mining stocks, or avoid it altogether?",6,39,2025-09-15 13:48:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhmcfe/thinking_about_investing_in_silver_whats_your_take/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093802

1nhhdz2,investing,What are the best sectors to invest in in 2025?,"I'm looking at different sectors and industries, and he are my thoughts. Very interested in your feedback. 


IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

1nhcsza,investing,"How to begin investing at the peak, quite a bit of global unrest","I am Software Engineer in tech company have been $300k for last 10 years on an average, but never learnt that investing is necessary to preserve wealth. I felt I would quit job in first few years and open a business but never materialized, so I kept living life on autopilot, just doing 9-5. In covid, i started taking interest watching lot of news about stock rocketing. I opened brokerage account and started investing, in doing so sold my employer RSU feeling it'll drop but it only double after I sold. Then to catch up for time lost, I taking big bets, invested 700k in various stocks and SPUS, but in August 2024 when trump announced tarriffs, lost 10% and panicked and sold losing 70k in cash. Then again mustered courage, and invested in Feb 2025, again tarriffs were announced, lost 20k. Then have been away from market ever since.

I also bought house all cash in 2023, as felt i have so much cash why should I do mortgage (also am against borrowing money on interest), but sadly house didn't appreciated, I bought in Austin, rather price dropped from price I bought. I feel as much I chase for parking money watching everyone multiply their savings, more I'm losing money.

I am at \~8% and they're both around \~16% for the year.  It has reached a point where my 401k has built up and I am now leaving too much money on the table by not switching to Fidelity.

Even if I just were to swap to Fidelity from the private investor and put it all in target date funds that would still safely out perform where I stand currently.

1nh8zz6,investing,Housing Market to Crash?  ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs Complicated.,"Since 2021, I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I‚Äôm here to say, with incredible confidence, that I‚Äôm actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years‚Ä¶at all. BUT I don‚Äôt think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I‚Äôve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates‚Ä¶ and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem ‚Äúallowable‚Äù if I‚Äôm allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let‚Äôs start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‚Äòmathing‚Äô to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today‚Äôs interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that‚Äôs not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here‚Äôs why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‚Äòshould‚Äô price homes: 
It doesn‚Äôt factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven‚Äôt. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market‚Äôs regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%‚Ä¶ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is ‚ÄúSomething has to give‚Äù.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?",0,45,2025-09-15 01:37:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nh8zz6/housing_market_to_crash_its_complicated/,2025-09-25 02:29:49.093877

1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I‚Äôm bullish on the company and we‚Äôre plenty diversified so we‚Äôre holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I‚Äôd sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That‚Äôs just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that‚Äôs not bad. 




Here‚Äôs where it‚Äôs free money:


1. I‚Äôll get this out of the way: I‚Äôm completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It‚Äôs been an underperformed and was ‚Äúfree‚Äù to begin with. I‚Äôm not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I‚Äôve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn‚Äôt have many unexpected upside moves, it‚Äôs just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I‚Äôm just not particularly worried about and it seems I‚Äôd be able to buy back in. I‚Äôm genuinely open to advice if I‚Äôm fucking something up, but I don‚Äôt think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngal7f/amzn_covered_calls_free_money/,2025-09-25 02:29:50.538561
1ng907k,investing,Trying to understand Li Auto stock (why it hasn't gone down more),"Li Auto has had, what looks to me, a terrible trend the past several months. August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

Over the last few decades where the assumption was generally ‚Äúdollar strong, don‚Äôt want foreign currencies dropping to eat the returns of dollars invested internationally‚Äù those hedges were essentially a form of downside insurance for exchange rates wiping out returns ‚Äúfrom the dollar perspective.‚Äù

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?

1nfwv0f,investing,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?",1403,97,2025-09-12 14:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nf46bi/is_oracle_just_softbank_wearing_a_mask/,2025-09-25 02:29:50.538728

1nejleo,investing,Thoughts on ANGX (Angel Studios) as a Long-Term Play?,"As a few of you know, angel Studios, a streaming company went live on the stock market today.

I‚Äôve been digging into ANGX (Angel Studios) now that it‚Äôs newly public, and I‚Äôm curious what others think about this one in its early days.

A few things caught my attention:

In less than a year, Angel Studios grew its Guild membership from 600,000 to 1.5 million.

That kind of subscriber growth feels exponential and, in some ways, comparable to Netflix in its early expansion phase.

The company already has a proven track record of producing surprise hits (e.g. Sound of Freedom, homestead and others), and if they can keep scaling content and membership, the upside could be massive.

I‚Äôm not saying this is a guaranteed rocket ship. nothing is, but if Angel continues on this trajectory, it could be a 10√ó in the next decade or two. Some even think it could become one of those rare 100√ó companies, but obviously that‚Äôs speculation.

Right now, I‚Äôm mainly shooting for the 10√ó potential and want to hear what others think:

Do you see ANGX as a serious long-term hold?

Is anyone else planning to buy in or build a position and just let it ride for years?

Or do you think the hype fades and the business model isn‚Äôt sustainable at scale?

Would love to hear different takes especially from those who invest in high-growth, early-stage public companies.",10,18,2025-09-11 20:25:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nejleo/thoughts_on_angx_angel_studios_as_a_longterm_play/,2025-09-25 02:29:50.538865

This market reaction is interesting because so far, the ‚Äúbig AI‚Äù bets were companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Palantir, Google, Meta, Broadcom, etc. Oracle, by contrast, has long been seen as more of a legacy play, focused on infrastructure for large enterprises.

What we‚Äôre seeing is that investors still go crazy for AI, especially when an established, ‚Äúold guard‚Äù player gets involved. Is this an overreaction? Hard to say.

1ndxhwm,investing,"Do ""Basic Options Strategies"" (Covered Calls, CSPs, Wheel) Really Beat QQQ Long-Term?","Hello everyone, 

I would like to hear some honest, no-holds-barred feedback from experienced and established traders.

My question is this: Over the course of 10+ years, do basic options strategies - specifically selling covered calls, cash-secured puts, or a wheel strategy - actually outperform growth-centric ETFs (i.e., QQQ)?

Everything I find online (especially on YouTube) seems to be very pro-options trading, but many of them that market themselves as coaches, typically are trying to sell you a course. On the other hand, there are guys like Ben Felix (who is a respectable financial planner) who cites research to describe options strategies as entirely irrelevant. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle trying to sort through it all.

For context:

1. I'm not trying to make a buck quickly.
2. I'm trying to establish a sustainable, long-term process.
3. I am fine with some weekly monitoring, I don't want to be checking trades every day.
4. I would options on stock with strong fundamentals and proven track record (no meme stocks, no speculative plays).

I understand that there is some mental capital and operational capital required for options - so I would only apply options if it became apparent the returns over the long-term would be better than only buying and holding on QQQ.

I've been dabbling in CSPs and covered calls over the last month, and the  results look good. Of course, one month of results are meaningless 

 If you‚Äôve traded options this way (or still do), I‚Äôd love to hear your experience: Did it genuinely beat buy-and-hold ETFs over the long term?",2,14,2025-09-11 02:39:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ndxhwm/do_basic_options_strategies_covered_calls_csps/,2025-09-25 02:29:50.538975

1ndru9i,investing,Moving to DIY investing portfolio via trading212,"I've been using nutmeg to invest for the past 2 ish years. After making a ~30% return, I figured I'd try and move to a more DIY approach to investing. 

I moved half my nutmeg portfolio value over to etoro for a month, copying ai/Tech heavy copytraders, a smart portfolio and a few individual stocks.

1ndr14c,investing,Seagate (STX) ‚Äì From ESPP discount to 140%+ gain. Did I stumble into gold?,"I started working at Seagate last year and decided to join their ESPP. Basically, employees can buy shares every 6 months at a 15% discount, either off the price at the start or end of the period (whichever is lower). Dividends get reinvested automatically through DRIP.

Last cycle I bought in at $79/share. When the stock hit $164, I asked here if I should sell, and most people said yes since I‚Äôd basically doubled my money. Instead, I decided to hold out for long term capital gains and now it‚Äôs at $193 and still climbing. For context, that‚Äôs higher than Nvidia‚Äôs stock price right now ($177 at the time of this post).

If the price stays where it is, by Feb 2026 I‚Äôll have about 46 shares worth ~$9k, after only putting in $5k. And with demand for data storage/data centers only growing, it feels like it could keep rising.

So my question is: did I just get insanely lucky stumbling into this, or is this kind of upside somewhat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with ESPPs when the timing works out?

1ndj7s6,investing,Investing Chinese companies - time to sell?,"I am a relatively new investor. I did some investing in 2014 for a year then pulled out of the market because I was still young and didn't have enough assets at the time. I have been back in the market for the last three years. Thankfully I have consistently beaten the market by a good margin but my main worry right now is that I have held a significant proportion of Chinese stocks - mainly because some good companies could be had at bargain prices. I am worried now that I misjudged and that the probability of war is rising to an uncomfortable level ( I don't think it's likely but Im realizing that even the possibility may be too much risk when you factor it into the valuation). My main Chinese holdings are Byd ( largest position by far), Bidu, Baba, and a small recent position in Xpev). What would happen if war starts? Is it time to sell those stocks? I've mostly held these stocks for more than a year.  I would say my risk tolerance is relatively high because I'm young with good income and no kids, but I can't justify holding on to them if there is a real possibility it goes to zero value
 
Having to pay tax before further compounding of those assets is a big negative, especially since I do like some of the companies still - but I am quite worried about the possibility that my hard earned savings will plummet to absolute zero overnight if a major war starts with the west. Is it time to take the painful and bold decision to sell everything Chinese? What about TSMC? Would you treat that the same given the vulnerability there?

-gpus depreciate in value pretty fast
-older gpus get lower demand/price over time
-WACC is quite high (debt is high)
-maintenance costs are high

And most importantly::: these companies will struggle to charge customers high due to pricing competition with each other.

I strongly suspect that the currently these companies are over valued based on their standard project net present value (project value minus discounted cash flow) is not as positive to justify curret valuations multiples.

1nd1mli,investing,Can never wrap my head around why Roth is not ALWAYS better than Traditional 401k,"I am a high income earner as a business owner.  Because it is a S Corp my tax bracket is quite high.  So it is fairly safe to say the chances are better that I see a better tax percentage when I retire than not (of course unless politicians increase it).

What I cannot wrap my head around is why a Roth is still not the better option.  And I have read a lot and I understand the principal...

So let's say I put $10,000 into my traditional 401k and it grows to $100,000 (just using easy math). And the same happens with the 10k in my Roth.  lets just use a 35% tax bracket for example

Traditional $10,000 = 3,500 tax savings = $6,500 in effect of cost to me

Roth is of course $10,000 = $0 tax savings = $10,000 in effect cost to me.

Retirement

Traditional = $100,000 Taxable at lets say 25% = 25,000 tax

Roth = $100,000 Non-Taxable so the original taxable cost of $10,000 remains

  
I understand the argument is if you take the tax savings from the traditional and invest it you see much more growth AND it offsets the Roth.  But.... what if that tax savings is just part of life and it's not necessarily invested?  I dont track my taxable savings from my traditional 401k to ensure I am investing it so I cant guarantee I am.....  Doesnt that make Roth always the better option unless you EXPLICITLY ensure you invest those tax savings?",0,43,2025-09-10 01:49:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nd1mli/can_never_wrap_my_head_around_why_roth_is_not/,2025-09-25 02:29:52.026225

1nclqt0,investing,Volatility: Is it a risk?,"Hello everyone,

  
My investment journey started one year ago. One of the major pillars I had in my mind was that I would not go fully in the markets until I understand what I was about to do. So, I started to read in the Internet, read some books and papers, listen to some podcasts .. It has been an enrichment experience!  
For sure that I don't dominate the area and most of the times I need a confirmation from someone, like ChatGPT or reddit users :)

Soooo, question of the day: does volatility and drawdowns represent risk? My view:  
1) Yes, on a psicological and behaviour perspective. People panic and try to minimize their losses, get out and return to the market later, etc.  
2) No, if you are literate in the topic and absorbed the right ideas. Volatility is nothing, just temporary oscillations that in fact represent opportunities to buy dips.

I have been a bit skeptical about my current portfolio, as I naturally prefer to keep it simple and avoid risky stuff. I started with 100% FTSE All World ETF, and I recently added 15% World Small Cap Value and 15% World Momentum.  
I am not going to lie, but it goes a bit against my initial view of risk avoidence profile and I considered to go back to the initial portfolio or to add some other factors, like Quality and Minimum Volatility ETFs. Well, it happens that now I don't care about volatility.  
  
Just to complete and finish my strategy, I intend to monthly DCA in the underweight ETF in order to keep the right % allocation. I considered also to rebalancing my selling a small % of outperformed ETF and reallocate to another, but it might not be fiscally efficient.  
Before 10years of retirement, I will add short bonds and start to weight it through time.

Thank you. All your hints will dissipate any doubt I might have or contribute to other perspectives I did not consider until now!",11,26,2025-09-09 15:18:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nclqt0/volatility_is_it_a_risk/,2025-09-25 02:29:52.026347

1ncjejf,investing,Day Trading vs Long-Term Investing. What actually works better for retail investors?,"I keep seeing divided opinions on whether retail investors should stick to long-term investing (index funds, blue chips, steady compounding) or try their hand at day trading for quicker gains.

Personally, I have done both.  
During lockdown, when covid was at its peak, I used to do trading with my father. We did some basic trading (inter-day) using fundamentals(P/E ratio etc.) rather than technical indicators. We made some decent gains since we bought when stocks were like at an all time low and were slowly increasing.   
We did it for like 6-8 months and in the meanwhile studied how to read candle sticks and technical indicators and then started intra-day trading. Initially we made tons of losses and almost quit doing it but one day we made around 6% profit in a single day (fluke most probably) and then got addicted to it. And guess what, We lost more than 3x that money the next day as we traded with emotion and not with logic and reasoning.

So i wondered whether intra-day trading is worth it for retail traders and they should stick to long-term or maybe we were just not experienced enough to study the market and it was our short-coming. 

If you guys have tried both then i would love to hear your experience!",0,29,2025-09-09 13:47:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ncjejf/day_trading_vs_longterm_investing_what_actually/,2025-09-25 02:29:52.026380

Return so far has been good, nothing extraordinary but it is beating the market. Short term results though so I take it for what it is.

Then the next day I got a call from the old advisor's assistant looking to schedule a call and talk about their new company. I'm definitely not looking to pay any new fees moving it over to a new company.

* Combined monthly expenses: \~1,100 ‚Ç¨ (rent, utilities, etc.) + \~400 ‚Ç¨ food
* Car: lease 250 ‚Ç¨/mo, gas 40 ‚Ç¨/mo, insurance 787 ‚Ç¨ every 6 months (service included)
* My computer loan: 153 ‚Ç¨/mo until Aug 2026
* Personal spending: \~300 ‚Ç¨ (me), \~500‚Äì550 ‚Ç¨ (her)

**Income:**

* Until now: 2,500 ‚Ç¨ net combined
* Starting Oct: 5,600 ‚Ç¨ net combined
* Plus I own a business with my father abroad ‚Üí 20‚Äì24k ‚Ç¨/year net dividends, usually paid once yearly (can also leave it in the business).

**Investments so far:**

**Our question:**  
From October we‚Äôll be able to save around 3k/month. How much of that should we actually invest, and how?

* Put some/all into something broad like the S&P 500?

1ncfymv,investing,Income up to 200k this year what should I do with 401k and new Roth IRA,"My income went from about 120k to around >200k recently this year. Up until now I was only putting about 4 percent into my 401k since there was no match yet. I also started a Roth IRA this year and I have a rollover($14k) from a previous Roth 401k. Do I need to take out this year‚Äôs contributions from the Roth IRA?

I know at this income it probably makes sense to switch to maxing pre tax 401k for the tax break. At the same time I want to save for a house in the next one to three years so I need to balance long term retirement with short term cash. Should I switch from Roth 401k to Traditional 401k?

I‚Äôm also trying to figure out the tax side since my withholdings may not line up perfectly. As both the w-4s were filed as them being my only job. Should I fix that through a W-4 adjustment or just put the extra aside myself in savings and pay it when I file

What‚Äôs the smarter move here max the 401k and save the rest for the house or keep the 401k lighter and stack more liquid cash, I‚Äôm about 25yrs old.

I‚Äôve also seen claims that ‚Äú4.7% is the new 4%‚Äù for safe withdrawal rates because of higher yields and inflation trends.


For those of you building toward retirement (or already there):

Do you stick to pure index funds and withdraw when needed?

Do you tilt toward dividend ETFs (like FDVV/SCHD/VYM) for more cash flow?

Or do you blend the two?

I've held money market cash for a period with the hopes of buying dips and seen stocks way outpace the interest I was earning. I know it's riskier but I don't mind risk.

But when all your money is invested, the problem with buying a dip is: with what money? I've thought about saving leveraged plays like margin and options for whenever an obvious, screamingly-good opportunity appears. Of course those are rare but it's prudent to have a plan for when something really exceptional happens.

1nc1p99,investing,Does the lump sum vs DCA calculus change if you are selling equity instead of sitting on cash?,"The research shows that investing a lump sum of cash is usually better than dollar cost averaging from a long term returns point of view, mostly because of having additional time in the market. DCA does reduce volatility and can be comforting psychologically, but I would personally rather just invest a lump sum of cash to maximize my time in the market. 

However, I‚Äôve been wondering if the calculus changes if someone had a large sum of equity in one particular stock, and they then wanted to move that capital to another stock or ETF? My initial instinct is that dollar cost averaging would be psychologically comforting in this situation. If someone was selling 100k of a stock all at once to immediately reinvest in something else, it would seem like this would open you up to big fluctuations in the prices of both holdings. 

Lump sum investing with a pile of cash makes sense because you would otherwise be leaving that money out of the market for longer by DCA. With having to first sell equity by contrast, your money is already in the market whether you sell & buy all at once or do things in increments; it‚Äôs a matter of moving money between between different assets. I know that taxes play a role here and would have to be considered.

I live in one of the more expensive cities in my country (because of my job location), and my basic spendings, i.e. Rent, Food, Groceries and Transport is around 25% of my salary.  
I need advice on how to divide the remaining money among luxury, investments and savings.

My goal is to maximise my net worth and financial freedom before i turn 28. I am thinking of investing in Stocks, Gold, Crypto and Index funds but I'm not sure what percentage of my remaining salary to invest and in what. Also I am ready to take a healthy amount of risk as I am still young.  
I also want to know how much should I spend on luxury items/services and what are some that are worth it.

Also apart from investing into the above, is there anything else that you would advice me to do with my money, feel free to mention.

1nbwis7,investing,"FLNC / NGVT / UAMY - Power, Infrastructure, and Rare Earths","NOTE: Yes, I just posted about Soybeans, but figured to split these things up to make for easier and focused readability.

My market plays for any next leg up in the market over the next 10-15 years are in electricity (production and supply storage+management) as well as rubberized cement compounds (next gen infrastructure products) - I wanted to say that healthcare and eldercare were sectors that should also see gains but with volatility surrounding Medicare/Medicaid and the effect that is having on regional hospitals and nursing homes I think that is looking more and more unlikely - sad as that is.

Lastly, I think Antimony (a rarely thought of metalloid with various uses in industry, military, and medical) is also due for a massive expansion in value even beyond what it has already seen.



**ELECTRICITY CHOICES**


As power needs go up, the storage of electricity will become paramount to keep generation optimal without inducing grid failure - a backup battery system for an entire city to help feed growing Data Centers and Crypto mining will be necessary - stabilize supply and the cost of electricity will come back down. Growing sector and very undervalued. National power grids are currently prone to instability and have to scale back power generation in times of lower demand. I think increasing demand will only bring more volatility to the Grid, especially in Texas. Having Grid-Scale power storage will do a lot to normalize supply and reduce the frequency of rolling blackouts - massively important as crypto mining and data centers draw more and more power.

Vistra (VST)

Benefits directly from power price spikes (especially in Texas ERCOT market).
Diversified portfolio of power generation.


Constellation Energy (CEG) 

Nuclear-heavy fleet with low-cost generation sells into wholesale markets.


**Fluence Energy (FLNC)** <-- huge potential

Grid-scale battery storage. HUGE hole in our infrastructure as currently cities and municipalities don't really use mechanisms that store excess electricity, it is simply lost and the producing elements of the system have to scale-back in times of low demand to prevent grid failure. FLNC would effectively provide city and regional grids with battery backup capacity that could be held to reduce volatility in and have supply in reserve which will also help bring the cost of electricity back down, which is something all entities generally want.


---


Whether centralized or through having homes outfitted with battery backup systems as a standard part of homebuilding going forward, this feels like the direction the grid will have to move in as consumption continues to grow exponentially. An uptick in these companies could also help the lithium recycling sector, which I also think is a massive hole and need in our overall market.


--



**ASPHALT / INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYS**



**Ingevity Corporation (NGVT) [Chart looks amazing]**

Role: Supplies specialty chemicals including rubberized asphalt components.



CRH plc (CRH)

Role: A diversified building materials company, parent of Oldcastle Materials in the U.S., which supplies asphalt and paving services including rubberized versions (e.g., ‚ÄúQuietPave‚Äù overlays)


---


I think rubberized asphalt is the future of pavement (reducing noise and sometimes even helping with traction) and this sector has massive room to grow - the mild levels of expansion and contraction will also prevent cracking and potentially lead to longer-term durability of the product - similar to ancient limestone structures which are incredibly durable due to the ability for internal expansion and contraction. There is a stretch of I-5 southbound South of Seattle that uses some materials similar to these and it is by far the smoothest and quietest drive there is. 

I like the potential for infrastructure overhauls to begin incorporating these materials in building and there is a lot of road we need to work on, nationally. Ingevity looks like an incredible long-term buy right now based on its charts.


--


**ANTIMONY** (both Antimony and Sodium Antimony in particular)


**United States Antimony (UAMY)**


Domestic Antimony mining company - will likely keep production high to lower reliance on Chinese holdings. China has scaled back mining of Antimony which has started to increase its value over time. More tied to mining/industry and prone to downturn WITH THE CAVEAT that it has resilience in times of increased defensive spending.


Perpetua Resources (PPTA)

Controls one of the largest known Antimony deposits in US. If there are any supply chain issues with China. Perpetua is insulated from and possibly even able to gain value during Stagflation simply by having its value tied to a massive store in this raw resource.

1nbv7qf,investing,Are Soybeans Ready to Soar? [Idea],"I tend to rotate my exposure to commodities based on where I feel we are in the cycle - think of it kind of like a boxing match only you're boxing the economy.


---
DEFENSIVE STABLE (BLOCK): GOLD AND WHEAT (if you want to hold value or potentially even grow wealth on the way down, these are the assets to do it in,

--
DEFENSIVE  MOMENTUM (COUNTERPUNCH): When entering a downturn, Silver tends to run up alongside gold [does better just before a recession begins], sometimes even more as we are seeing right now. Corn, conversely, does better when exiting defensive momentum [does better as we get confirmation that recession is over and oil demand increases] as it is not only a food staple but also sees an increase in demand when fuel demand increases (Ethanol),

--
OFFENSIVE STABLE (JAB): Platinum and Soybeans. Soy is incredibly versatile in the agro sphere beyond food which helps it in market downturns and lifts it coming out of them. Platinum has a stable demand in technological components like chip making, which see a downturn when the market is doing bad but should see an increase in demand first, potentially alongside Lithium.

--
OFFENSIVE MOMENTUM (HAYMAKER): Lithium and Antimony. Agricultural commodities fall off when the economy is back in full swing, so further allocations into raw metals like Lithium (tech and batteries) as well as Antimony give you the best opportunity to gain now that you have your opening and opportunity to take big swings at your opponent. Antimony can and should see strategic moments of defensive resilience when defense spending is increasing, as well.


----

--
Most signs - to me - point to us wanting to enter a Defensive/Block or Defensive/Momentum, phase of this cycle HOWEVER, I uncovered something on Soybeans that makes me think that we have an opportunity for a ""Jab"" here. The warning being that Agriculture is being brutalized by tariffs and many family farms are on the brink of collapse - BUT - I feel like we should see another agricultural bail out and/or tariff exemptions before this happens.



BACK TO SOYBEANS - They have tended to perform very admirably during recessionary and stagflationary environments in the past and beyond food (constant need) Soy is an extremely flexible crop. THAT BEING SAID, right now Soy is hurting alongside the rest of AG and that hurt has caused a massive falloff in yield.


Thinking about how Supply/Demand economics tend to behave I would like to direct your attention to something called the STOCKS-TO-USE RATIO -- essentially, the lower this number is, the tighter supply is, and any uptick in demand is going to cause the value of the tighter supply to skyrocket.


WHEAT, which I am also watching closely for a rebound, has a fairly low stocks-to-use-ratio of roughly 32% - that means that under current/constant supply, we have enough wheat to last a third of the year without stimulus or an uptick in production. That is actually fairly low by Wheat's standards and signals that it really shouldn't have much lower to go before a rebound.


---
SOYBEANS currently have a stocks-to-use-ratio of roughly 7.2%... SEVEN POINT TWO. THREE WEEKS UNDER NORMAL DEMAND. There is speculation that, counting China, this ratio is closer to maybe 25% but that is still incredibly low. With fairly high market uncertainty right now, anything spooky could trigger an increase in food demands. With an accelerating market, Soy is still needed to make products and biofuels. Even if the economy from this day forward traded sideways in perpetuity, we have three weeks of supply on hand.

With Soybeans, something absolutely has to give and I think we may be incredibly close to an explosion of value.


TODAY, a bushel of soybeans costs $10.27 roughly - the all-time high bushel price was in September 2012 at $17.95 which coincided with a stocks-to-use ratio of 3.9% - I'm interested in what will play out as this sort of ""agricultural squeeze play"" sets in.",0,7,2025-09-08 18:10:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nbv7qf/are_soybeans_ready_to_soar_idea/,2025-09-25 02:29:52.026664

But in 2020 I could see these were unusual times. High quality energy companies were trading at a fraction of their traditional prices so I bought some and they've returned 300+% and return 6+% on cost. Same thing happened in 2021 with REITs, 2022 with EU banks etc. All have far out-returned SP500 and give me a very healthy dividend.

I've gone back to Boglehead investing since then, but whenever I mention my 2020/21/22 buys many index fund investers refuse to believe this ever occurred. They even fabricate weird scenarios such as if I had bought SPY at the very bottom of 2020 I'd be far ahead of where I am now. Even on the weekend at a party someone working in semi-conductors said he went all in on NVDA, TMSC etc and it's set them up for early retirement the argument was he could have retired earlier if he just invested in index funds!

1nbrvwm,investing,Investment Idea: Long LPLA today at $335,"Been a minute since I posted with a lot of valuations stretched at the moment, but just got long LPL following a sharp sell off on Friday (attributed to jobs report but I‚Äôd guess an institutional investor sold and that can move the stock since it has a smaller market cap).

My investment thesis:
1. LPL‚Äôs current CEO came from UBS and has a background in digital innovation. The company‚Äôs revenue and profits have been on a tear since he took the helm and they‚Äôve transformed the business into a leading Wealth Tech platform with a rev share model that is attracting independent broker dealers and advisors onto the platform. This model is both highly durable and highly profitable and creates stickiness in a space where historically there hasn‚Äôt been much. 20%+ earnings/revenue growth the past 5 years.
2. The Wealth space is starting to undergo increased consolidation with many advisors retiring in the next several years and LPL has engaged in aggressive M&A and has a strong track record of bringing firms onto the platform
3. UBS has been hemorrhaging advisors after a recent comp change and LPL is likely to be an outsized beneficiary of this, particularly given management‚Äôs background.
4. The push into private assets for 401ks/IRAs is going to make advice even more important to retail investors and LPL stands to be at the forefront working with alternative asset managers like Blackstone/Apollo to benefit from assets flowing into private asset classes.
5. The price tanked Friday by 7.5% without any material news, creating a short-term price dislocation
6. On a forward PE basis the company is trading below 20x, meaning it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù than the S&P. The wealth space generates tremendous ROE/ROIC as it‚Äôs a capital-light business.

My background for quick orientation: 

- EU located, (so Roth IRA, 401k etc. Are not applicable for me. I am maxing out the retirement options available in my country though)
- no mortgage or other debts to worry about
- long Horizon (30+ years until retirement)

Last November I inherited decent amount of money that I decided to put into stock market for investing. Ever since, I DCA'd every month, so far 100% into individual stocks, all in US market. It got shaky in April, but after recovery I'm well ahead - I had some misses (BRK.B) but also picked many winners of this year so far - AVGO, ORCL, GOOG etc.

I know, I know, picked top tech stocks in AI craze time in a bullish market and got returns, hardly a difficult achievement. I read a lot of threads here, and recurring wisdom is that beating the market once doesn't mean I will manage to do so every year. Which is why I started thinking about moving some of my assets into ETF's and maybe other more stable instruments so my portfolio is no longer 100% individual stocks.

And now here comes the question I would love to get an advice from more experienced investors - what's the best strategy in my position?

A) keep the winners, let them run wild, cut the losses, sell my misses and move those funds into ETF's?

B) vice versa - realize the gains, move them to ETF's, keep dca'ing losses until they go back into green?

C) Just move all of it, winners or losers?

D) Leave all of them alone, and dca into ETF'S from now on instead?

E) None of the above?

1nprxr3,stocks,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180‚Äôs and buying at 170‚Äôs. It‚Äôs been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia‚Äôs key points 

1. They‚Äôre not lying about demand. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success‚Ä¶the reason Nvidia isn‚Äôt concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they‚Äôve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I‚Äôve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That‚Äôs execution.

4. OpenAI isn‚Äôt a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that‚Äôs still operating privately. People don‚Äôt understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has‚Ä¶

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn‚Äôt Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31‚Ä¶..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn‚Äôt give a sht about value.The needle won‚Äôt explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that‚Äôs constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It‚Äôs an Undervalued stock considering it‚Äôs crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I‚Äôve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we‚Äôll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I‚Äôve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

‚Ä¢ **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

‚Ä¢ **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

‚Ä¢ **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
‚Ä¢ AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
‚Ä¢ Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
‚Ä¢ More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
‚Ä¢ New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
‚Ä¢ Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
‚Ä¢ Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
‚Ä¢ Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
‚Ä¢ Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
‚Ä¢ Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
‚Ä¢ Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
‚Ä¢ Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
‚Ä¢ High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
‚Ä¢ Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
‚Ä¢ Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
‚Ä¢ Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
‚Ä¢ Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
‚Ä¢ Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
‚Ä¢ Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
‚Ä¢ Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
‚Ä¢ Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",88,62,2025-09-24 21:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.489789

1npgy3w,stocks,Question about a financial advisor‚Äôs choices,"I have a general question for folks who have long-term experience with financial advisors. I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it‚Äôs clear that such an approach makes managing client‚Äôs accounts much less labor intensive, and if one‚Äôs clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it‚Äôs easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

1npgter,stocks,Stagflation Sell-off Incoming,"Unemployment rate is ticking up and the Fed has described their dual mandate: lowering unemployment rate while making sure inflation doesn't run up on us.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,stocks,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there‚Äôs three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I‚Äôve read they‚Äôve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that‚Äôll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they‚Äôre expecting that hasn‚Äôt been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren‚Äôt adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren‚Äôt for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.

1npc6fd,stocks,$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara‚Äôs Flu Prophylaxis CD388,"In my first post ([CDTX ‚Äì Is their CD388 ‚Äúuniversal flu prophylaxis‚Äù the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) I hinted (very strongly!) that FDA minutes for Cidara's ""End of Phase 2"" meeting could be a major turning point for Cidara. That news is now official, and it‚Äôs even stronger than expected:

**1. Phase 3 accelerated**

* Start pulled forward by 6 months:  enrollment begins Fall ‚Äô25 in the Nothern Hemisphere, not Spring ‚Äô26 as previously planned.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2‚Äì3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ‚â•65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ‚â•65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the ‚Äúbinary biotech discount‚Äù the market is still applying to CD388.

**What‚Äôs next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA‚Äôs help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it‚Äôs still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388‚Äôs long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today‚Äôs FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today‚Äôs FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.‚Äù

In my next post, I‚Äôll do a deeper dive into why CD388‚Äôs probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

1npbyeg,stocks,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

1np25et,stocks,Why do people trade stocks instead of just holding for the long term?,"I‚Äôve always been told that long term investing is the best strategy for most people. Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is ‚Äútime in the market beats timing the market,‚Äù and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you‚Äôll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

What's your take on it, and where should I be looking forward?

During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> ‚ÄúWe do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we‚Äôre trying to achieve,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.‚Äù In the run-up to last week‚Äôs policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> ‚ÄúMarkets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they‚Äôll price things in,‚Äù Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates. Though Powell noted the lofty equity values, he said this is ‚Äúnot a time of elevated financial stability risks.‚Äù",1049,170,2025-09-23 18:56:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1noq1ae/fed_chief_powell_says_stock_prices_appear_fairly/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.489951

1nog1cb,stocks,"American Superconductor (AMSC): real revenue, big cash, defense/grid tech, and increasing power demands but next to no discussion?","AMSC posted Q1 FY2025 revenue of $72.4M (‚âà +80% YoY), GAAP net income of about $6.7M, and $213 million cash on hand after a $115M offering, a multi-year $200 million backlog from defense and industrial orders, and an accretive acquisition that improves margins. That combination makes AMSC one of the cleaner mid-cap growth plays I‚Äôve seen recently but there‚Äôs very little discussion around this company compared to other energy-adjacent players.

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems). The company recently added NWL, which brings recurring industrial and defense power sales. They seem to be a differentiated niche leader. AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don‚Äôt, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I‚Äôm curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there‚Äôs as much upside left here as it seems.

1no71q0,stocks,I Believe it‚Äôs Possible For Kenvue ($KNVU) To Sue The Administration And Win Sending The Stock Price,"let‚Äôs dive into the latest drama surrounding Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer goods giant that spun off from Johnson & Johnson. The stock has taken a beating recently due to President Trump and RFK Jr‚Äôs comments linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the situation and what it might mean for investors.

The Controversy:

President Trump, along with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., held a press conference today, where Trump stated that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, can lead to a higher risk of autism. He advised pregnant women against using the medication. This news has sent Kenvue‚Äôs stock tumbling, with some investors seeing it as a buying opportunity and others as a red flag. The stock is down 21% in one month. 

Kenvue‚Äôs Response:

Kenvue has strongly denied any link between Tylenol and autism, citing extensive scientific research that supports the drug‚Äôs safety. The company‚Äôs interim CEO, Kirk Perry, even met with RFK Jr. to dispute the claims. Additionally, courts have already dismissed similar lawsuits in 2023 for lack of evidence, which could bolster Kenvue‚Äôs defense.



Legal and Regulatory Environment:

The FDA has studied acetaminophen for over a decade and has not found a causal link between the drug and autism. This regulatory support could help Kenvue defend itself against potential lawsuits. However, the outcome of these legal battles will be crucial in determining the long-term impact. 

Public Perception and Consumer Behavior:

Public perception and consumer behavior will play a significant role in determining the stock‚Äôs performance. If consumers continue to trust Tylenol despite the claims, the impact on sales and stock price may be limited. However, if there is a significant shift in consumer behavior, it could lead to a drop in demand for Tylenol, affecting Kenvue‚Äôs revenue and stock price.

Conclusion:

The situation with Kenvue is complex, with both risks and potential opportunities. Investors should carefully consider the company‚Äôs strong denial, regulatory support, and potential market overreaction. However, the outcome of legal battles and public perception will be crucial in determining the long-term impact on Kenvue‚Äôs stock. As always, do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.

The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs (DOE‚Äôs) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE‚Äôs newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*‚ÄúOklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,‚Äù said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ‚ÄúAs advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we‚Äôre seeing under President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs American Energy Dominance Agenda.‚Äù*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*‚ÄúThis opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,‚Äù said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. ‚ÄúWe have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,‚Äù said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America‚Äôs largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025.

1nny89w,stocks,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you‚Äôre looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",0,16,2025-09-22 20:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490115

Do we think profit will eventually matter?,"A lot of people were dubious about how OpenAI would be able to afford the (up to) $300 billion contract they signed with Oracle.. well now we know part of the answer is Nvidia investing (up to) $100 billion into OpenAI

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

1nntg89,stocks,"In a low rates environment, nearly all equities are winners. Why stocks only go up. (For now).","It feels like, no matter the bad news, equities just keep climbing. Here‚Äôs the(my) reasoning as to why this is happening and why it'll likely continue.

First, let‚Äôs state the obvious: we‚Äôre not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he‚Äôs been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell‚Äôs term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I‚Äôve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we‚Äôre heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets‚Äô current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",50,30,2025-09-22 17:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490148

This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further.

1nnpqxs,stocks,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",955,324,2025-09-22 15:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490196

1nnk82c,stocks,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	‚Ä¢	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	‚Ä¢	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	‚Ä¢	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	‚Ä¢	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	‚Ä¢	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	‚Ä¢	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	‚Ä¢	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They‚Äôre growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

‚∏ª

CREAL (2998.T)
	‚Ä¢	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	‚Ä¢	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	100% annual net income growth
	‚Ä¢	54% gross profit CAGR
	‚Ä¢	GMV +93% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Net margins improving each year
	‚Ä¢	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	‚Ä¢	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	‚Ä¢	A true ‚Äúsubscription/toll bridge‚Äù style business in the making.

‚∏ª

Loadstar (3482.T)
	‚Ä¢	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	‚Ä¢	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	‚Ä¢	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	‚Ä¢	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	‚Ä¢	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	‚Ä¢	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

‚∏ª

Good Life (2970.T)
	‚Ä¢	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	‚Ä¢	Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Net income up 48% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 44% YoY
	‚Ä¢	ROE ~29%
	‚Ä¢	PE ~11
	‚Ä¢	Share buybacks in 2025
	‚Ä¢	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

‚∏ª

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	‚Ä¢	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	‚Ä¢	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	‚Ä¢	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	‚Ä¢	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	‚Ä¢	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	‚Ä¢	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

‚∏ª

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds. With the U.S. looking stretched, diversifying into Japan here looks like a once-in-a-generation setup.",87,84,2025-09-22 11:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnk82c/why_japanese_real_estate_small_caps_might_be_the/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490240

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it‚Äôs only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a ¬£2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they‚Äôve issued a statement on it welcoming in the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù of nuclear energy.

- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a ¬£9,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.  More countries will look to sign similar deals.

- Earlier in September, Rolls-Royce announced their involvement in providing reactors for Australia's new fleet of nuclear submarines, under the AUKUS defense agreement with the UK and US, further expanding its role in nuclear submarine technology:

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of ¬£12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to ¬£14.40 / $19.44.
(The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven‚Äôt even mentioned it.)

- The vast majority of analysts are rating RR a buy. 
 
- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and ‚Äì having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions ‚Äì Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago.

Sure I‚Äôve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.  
[‚Ä¶and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will ¬£20 within the next 12 months =  74% higher than we are here.  And longer term it‚Äôll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

I understand it‚Äôs pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? 

Russia‚Äôs control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn‚Äôt seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. 

Historically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven‚Äôt really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don‚Äôt have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn‚Äôt affect global markets like a war in Europe would.

1nn8wd5,stocks,The reason I‚Äôm shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I‚Äôve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley‚Äôs are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley‚Äôs. When economic conditions are rough, there‚Äôs not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn‚Äôt be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is ‚Äúmotorcycles are dangerous‚Äù. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything‚Äôs great until it isn‚Äôt and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I‚Äôm sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",145,90,2025-09-22 00:59:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nn8wd5/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490302

1nmnics,stocks,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, ‚Äúaccessible luxury‚Äù) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I‚Äôve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU‚Äôs demise, I thought ‚Äúoh course!‚Äù (hindsight‚Äôs easy, huh?) and began thinking who‚Äôs next? While already down bad this year, I can‚Äôt help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle‚Äôs Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term ‚Äúslop bowl‚Äù has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don‚Äôt know where they can turn. I don‚Äôt think they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with ‚Äúhealthy options‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh ingredients‚Äù, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they‚Äôve made it to the top. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Now, they feel tired and clich√©d. Their complacency isn‚Äôt deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we‚Äôre at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we‚Äôve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. It feels like we‚Äôre seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. One thing‚Äôs for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",7,4,2025-09-21 09:27:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nmnics/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490350

1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing‚Äôs 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don‚Äôt want to go on too much longer, but I‚Äôll finish off with where I‚Äôm most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that‚Äôs what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don‚Äôt even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody‚Äôs reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",36,38,2025-09-20 18:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm567c/the_future_of_rddt_stock/,2025-09-25 02:29:54.490396

Trump drops a figurative nuclear bomb on Friday afternoon, the media panics about it over the weekend, markets plummet on Monday, and then he reverses course on Wednesday and everything is back to normal. Trump and his insiders make millions while everyone else gets screwed. 

This H1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. A sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. Only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. It's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the H1b.

1nm2ecd,stocks,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can‚Äôt lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it‚Äôs even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I‚Äôm crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

1nlylxt,stocks,Why is using maximum margin to buy and hold long term a bad idea when the numbers say otherwise?,"Everyone always says using margin is a terrible idea, it‚Äôs super risky etc.  right now I have a $100,000 trading account, let‚Äôs say 5 years ago I used my full maximum margin to simply invest $300,000 to buy GOOGL ($200,000 of which would be from margin). Even after all the interest you would pay on the margin funds, I would practically be a millionaire.  

Let‚Äôs be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?

1nlxych,stocks,ETFs that benefit from the likely multiple interest rate cuts and a probable strong Q4.,"**SPDR S&P 500 ETF¬†(SPY)**:  It has a clean 10% run from late May that holds into September, which breaks the historical trend that is known for low volume and choppy price action.  This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF¬†(MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,stocks,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies ‚Üí spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies ‚Üí futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they‚Äôre cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What‚Äôs wilder: the effect isn‚Äôt uniform.

* Banking & IT ‚Üí bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma ‚Üí high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos ‚Üí low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

1nlsjr7,stocks,Investment Strategy,"Hello everyone. 

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I‚Äôm doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I‚Äôve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I‚Äôve never had much of a strategy, I‚Äôve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I‚Äôve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in ‚Äúcore‚Äù growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in ‚Äúmoonshots‚Äù like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I‚Äôm up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it‚Äôs becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. 

How can I remain cold & calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money & focus on my new strategy?",0,11,2025-09-20 08:15:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlsjr7/investment_strategy/,2025-09-25 02:29:56.332352
1nlrvhd,stocks,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

1nlleqw,stocks,Loaded 70% of my portfolio into BMNR how scary could dilution get?,"Just went pretty heavy on BMNR , about $7k, which is 70% of my portfolio.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here‚Äôs what another raise might look like:
	‚Ä¢	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that‚Äôs roughly 33M new shares ‚Üí about 15% dilution.
	‚Ä¢	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that‚Äôs 66M shares ‚Üí closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	‚Ä¢	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it‚Äôs only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

I have a simple hypothesis that is being proven correct empirically: **Weakening dollar and overvalued US stocks will cause VSUX to outperform VTI**

Bogleheads are all too familiar with the theory 30-40% international diversification in their portfolios. But what about the rest of investors? Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement.

Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation. But I suspect that few winners will carry the lot, still resulting in broad market underperformance compared to internationals. It can't be ignored that solid international equities are much cheaper with reasonable PE relative to US hyper PE growth companies.

1nlf722,stocks,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Krak√≥w, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC‚Äôs total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social‚Äôs strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout‚Äôs competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It‚Äôs moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

What‚Äôs do you guys think about Sprout Social?",5,2,2025-09-19 20:54:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlf722/spt_sprout_social_big_upside_move_ahead_ai_and/,2025-09-25 02:29:56.332439

1nl7vt4,stocks,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


‚ÄúIn the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the ‚Äúbreakeven‚Äù rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today‚Äôs meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.‚Äú",41,16,2025-09-19 16:14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl7vt4/jerome_powell_on_the_labor_market_and_why_they/,2025-09-25 02:29:56.332478

> U.S. chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) has signed a letter of intent for a possible $500 million investment in the next funding round at Britain's Wayve, the autonomous driving technology group said on Thursday. The development comes after Britain and the United States signed a technology pact aimed at boosting ties in artificial intelligence and other fields. Founded in 2017, Wayve raised over $1 billion last year, led by SoftBank Group and supported by Nvidia. Ride-hailing platform Uber had also made a separate investment in the firm in 2024, for an undisclosed sum.

> Wayve's technology, unlike conventional systems that rely on detailed digital maps and coding, uses machine learning with camera sensors mounted on the vehicles to learn from traffic patterns and driver behaviour. Its autonomous driving platforms have been powered by a partnership with Nvidia, whose chips are now bolstering a global AI boom.

1nl2uoj,stocks,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out (¬†[A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).¬† The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ‚â•10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388‚Äôs potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic ‚Äúinsurance value‚Äù** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

¬†

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ‚Äô25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.¬† May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on ¬†Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† BARDA decision on grant application.¬† CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",115,57,2025-09-19 11:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,2025-09-25 02:29:56.332519

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,stocks,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock ‚Äì High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn‚Äôt give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** ‚Äì In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon‚Äôs business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** ‚Äì turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  ‚Äì the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** ‚Äì its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.",46,36,2025-09-19 03:00:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nksav5/ups_has_a_limited_downside_from_this_price/,2025-09-25 02:29:56.332666

This makes me doubt the long term prospects for Intel here. It seems like Nvidia is investing this money to help their China export prospects and gain favor with the current admin, and it won't help Intel's foundry struggles.. so that means TSMC will likely continue being the winner regardless

Why it matters:

* **H5 is high-mortality flu** with pandemic potential.
* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow‚Äôs readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that‚Äôs additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.

1nk3147,stocks,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it‚Äôs sitting near $20. That‚Äôs not just meme momentum it‚Äôs tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn‚Äôt even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account.

1njy059,stocks,Zillow Will Benefit Strongly From A Housing Rebound,"**Zillow (Z) $90.75,¬† Planning to add tomorrow morning**

**Industry/Sector/Type - - - Housing Marketplace/Platform/Steady growth tied to housing cyclicality.**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It‚Äôs asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak. Existing home and new home sales peaked around Q1-2022 at 6.1Mn and 1Mn units respectively. Now, they‚Äôre down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What‚Äôs positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.¬† Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,¬† growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter‚Äôs earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they‚Äôre just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass‚Äô use of private ‚Äúpocket listings,‚Äù reduces the availability of listings on Zillow‚Äôs site, attacking Zillow‚Äôs business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow‚Äôs appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

However, if housing recovers, we're still getting in close to the market trough. More importantly, Zillow has used the housing downturn to emerge stronger and gain market share at the expense of weaker rivals.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC¬†report¬†in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses¬†appeared¬†on Meta‚Äôs YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company‚Äôs audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental¬†Orion augmented reality glasses¬†that the company revealed at last year‚Äôs Connect event.¬†Orion¬†can overlay 3D visuals over a person‚Äôs real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

‚ÄúThese are glasses with the classic style that you‚Äôd expect from Ray-Ban, but they‚Äôre the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn‚Äôt block a person‚Äôs view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that¬†went on sale¬†in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person‚Äôs temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company‚Äôs original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version¬†released¬†in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company‚Äôs Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta‚Äôs partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‚Äë1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‚Äëbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid‚Äôs tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber‚Äôs endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1njfr5i,stocks,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

1njffif,stocks,Bill Ackman Insurance acquisition TBA soon at 09/30 annual meeting?,"Previously Bill Ackman for HHH mentioned that he was looking to acquire a 1-3B+ insurance co following the model of Warren Buffett.¬†

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play.

1nj9v93,stocks,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia‚Äôs AI chips,"China‚Äôs internet regulator has banned the country‚Äôs biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia‚Äôs artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia‚Äôs tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia‚Äôs server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia‚Äôs other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia‚Äôs models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker‚Äôs ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president‚Äôs state visit to the UK.

‚ÄúWe can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I‚Äôm understanding of that. We are patient about it.‚Äù 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country‚Äôs homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

‚ÄúThe message is now loud and clear,‚Äù said an executive at one of the tech companies. ‚ÄúEarlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it‚Äôs all hands on deck to build the domestic system.‚Äù

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing‚Äôs progress on AI.

Beijing‚Äôs regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia‚Äôs China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China‚Äôs AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China‚Äôs chipmakers were seeking to triple the country‚Äôs total output of AI processors next year.

‚ÄúThe top-level consensus now is there‚Äôs going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,‚Äù said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang‚Äôs visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China‚Äôs regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia‚Äôs H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,stocks,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft¬†said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest supercomputer,‚Äù with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as¬†President Donald Trump¬†embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its¬†attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was¬†cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator¬†later that year.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,‚Äù Smith said. However, he added, ‚ÄúI am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn‚Äôt the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,‚Äù Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday ‚Äúto unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,‚Äù the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you‚Äôre probably pretty happy right now.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *‚Äúlandmark moment,‚Äù* while United‚Äôs CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock‚Äôs volatility.

**The bigger question:**

- Are we seeing the real start of urban air mobility, or is this just another news-fueled pump before a long wait on certification?

- Can these fleets actually scale like ridesharing, or will costs/noise/local politics kill it?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The company is looking to raise DKK 60 billion (around EUR 8 billion) to fund the construction of the Sunrise Wind project in New York and enhance its financial flexibility, which also includes helping to cover any impact the recently issued federal stop-work order for Revolution Wind may have.

Since the developer was unable to secure a partial divestment of Sunrise Wind and the associated project financing, as per its usual business model, √òrsted needs to fund the construction of the entire 924 MW offshore wind project on its own balance sheet, which requires an incremental funding of approximately DKK 40 billion (around EUR 5.4 billion), according to the developer.

1nhxe5d,stocks,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

This is just my idea, of course, not advice. I am very interested to hear what you think. Am I missing something? Let me know your thoughts and if you see any mistakes in my thinking.",0,23,2025-09-15 20:36:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhxe5d/echostar_sats_seems_massively_undervalued_after/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.146891

1nhozun,stocks,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",256,243,2025-09-15 15:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.146904

1nhof8h,stocks,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

‚∏ª

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking ‚ÄúWhat did I just read?‚Äù I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia ‚Äì More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

‚∏ª

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

‚∏ª

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor‚Äôs efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don‚Äôt have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

‚∏ª

Possible Growth:

	‚Ä¢Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	‚Ä¢Target population of the US is 128 million people

	‚Ä¢A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	‚Ä¢The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

‚∏ª

Company Financial Health: Good

	‚Ä¢Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	‚Ä¢Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	‚Ä¢This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

‚∏ª

So we have a lot of potential here but let‚Äôs not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

‚∏ª

Major Risks to Consider:

	‚Ä¢They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	‚Ä¢They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	‚Ä¢I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	‚Ä¢It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	‚Ä¢The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	‚Ä¢Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	‚Ä¢Short Interest is 30% ‚Äì it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

‚∏ª

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhnjwm,stocks,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President¬†Donald Trump¬†floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a¬†Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is ‚Äúsubject to SEC approval‚Äù and would ‚Äúsave money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever hear the statement that, ‚ÄòChina has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!‚Äô‚Äù Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018¬†op-ed piece¬†for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs¬†Warren Buffett¬†and JPMorgan Chase CEO¬†Jamie Dimon¬†advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

‚ÄúIn our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,‚Äù the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by¬†Nvidia,¬†Microsoft¬†and¬†Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust¬†ruling¬†by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal¬†monopoly in search¬†and related advertising.

But Judge¬†Amit Mehta¬†decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President¬†Donald Trump¬†congratulated the company and¬†called¬†it ‚Äúa very good day.‚Äù

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google‚Äôs IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the¬†creation¬†of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was¬†named CEO¬†of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai‚Äôs latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up¬†helping¬†Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company‚Äôs hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google‚Äôs flagship suite of AI models.

1ngvvff,stocks,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

1ngvaz4,stocks,Hennessy funds recommends these top 3 small caps to become GIANTS,"Josh Wein, a VP & key 5 star portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, who manages 10 of the funds worth collectively 3B in AUM, recently mentioned that these 3 top small caps are his favorite to become giants.

**$ROOT insurance:**

ROOT insurance is an insurance company with a 1.5B market-cap that underwrites risk utilizing AI targeting safe drivers, which allows them to have less risk & better profit margins than their legacy peers. ROOT although small, has been beating legacy insurers on all metrics all around, including pricing, loss ratios, and a forward efficient tech stack. ROOT has recently partnered with the biggest names in auto including Toyota, Hyundai, CVNA, Experian, etc, which now sports 20+ major partners strong, and many more to come. Their partnership channel has been growing at 3x YoY, and you quickly realize why Josh thinks ROOT could end up being a giant one day.

**$COMP**

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

**$WMK Weis Markets Inc**

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

are there any other small caps that you would suggest other than what Wein has recommended?",0,14,2025-09-14 16:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngvaz4/hennessy_funds_recommends_these_top_3_small_caps/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147057

1ngujqq,stocks,Mag 7: exposure to AI downside,"Hi everyone,

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun‚Äôs take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

P.S.: My current Mag7 top pick for the medium-long term is Alphabet.",91,83,2025-09-14 15:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngujqq/mag_7_exposure_to_ai_downside/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147069

1ngogkq,stocks,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",11,98,2025-09-14 11:06:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147082

1nfl6jr,stocks,My thoughts on PAR.,"Hey Everyone,

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

1nfj3ri,stocks,Why I‚Äôm selling $RDDT even though I think it has great growth potential,"(Purely on vibes, no fundamental analysis)

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it‚Äôs a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House‚Äôs bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against ‚Äúthe violent left.‚Äù High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They‚Äôve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit‚Äôs growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms. If Reddit refuses, the administration will pursue many options to punish Reddit, like tying it up in lawsuits or preventing other companies from doing business with Reddit.

Either way, this should significantly affect Reddit stock price.

Could I be wrong and then RDDT runs up some more? Of course, but I‚Äôm already up 450% and won‚Äôt lose any sleep from selling it.",0,29,2025-09-13 00:06:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfj3ri/why_im_selling_rddt_even_though_i_think_it_has/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147153
1nfgpnp,stocks,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me anymore. I‚Äôm not doing anything fancy like options these days. I‚Äôm a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side.

> Shares of Pfizer and Moderna fell on Friday after a report that Trump administration health officials plan to link Covid vaccines to the deaths of 25 children.  The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. ‚ÄúFDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,‚Äù a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. ‚ÄúUntil that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,‚Äù the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer‚Äôs stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is ‚Äúrigorously monitored‚Äù by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries.

You can participate in IPOs but they have an anti-flipping rule that if you sell it within 15 days you get a 180 day ban from participating in IPOs the first time, and if you do it again you get a 1 year ban. Kind of annoying since if they were serious about IPO flipping they would just outright prohibit you from doing it. Also, presumably institutions and higher-level traders don't have those types of restrictions, so it's really a penalty to disadvantage retail traders.

1nfa1qo,stocks,Follow-up: Why flu vaccine economics shouldn‚Äôt apply to Cidara‚Äôs (CDTX) CD388 universal flu prophylaxis,"In response to my earlier post asking if Cidara‚Äôs (CDTX) CD388 ‚Äúuniversal flu prophylaxis‚Äù was the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market ([CDTX ‚Äì Is their CD388 ‚Äúuniversal flu prophylaxis‚Äù the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I received a number of comments that begged the question:  Why should CD388 be priced any differently than flu vaccines?

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn‚Äôt a vaccine! It **doesn‚Äôt depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they‚Äôre protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don‚Äôt deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value ‚Äì economic or otherwise.  That‚Äôs why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this ‚Äúicing on the cake‚Äù from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I‚Äôll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 ‚Äúuniversal flu prophylaxis‚Äù the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I‚Äôve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.",9,11,2025-09-12 17:55:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfa1qo/followup_why_flu_vaccine_economics_shouldnt_apply/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147213

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nev4bo,stocks,NASDAQ wants to tokenize stocks‚Ä¶ are they just late to the party?,"When Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs finally got approved, it felt like TradFi was pulling crypto into its world.
But with Nasdaq now asking the SEC to allow trading tokenized stocks, the roles might be reversing: traditional finance is moving into blockchain territory.

What stands out is that tokenization isn‚Äôt new.

Crypto platforms have already been experimenting with RWA products for a while  from tokenized bonds to futures tied to stocks like TSLA or NVDA.

These products weren‚Äôt perfect, but they proved the concept and attracted real user demand.


Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That‚Äôs a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn‚Äôt just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here‚Äôs the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don‚Äôt make money, they burn money, so it‚Äôs not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it‚Äôs really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it‚Äôs also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm‚Äôs hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it‚Äôs going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won‚Äôt be pretty.

1ne09jg,stocks,"$BYRN DD: It's Mispriced, and I think it'll pop by October 8th. I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company‚Äôs publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman‚Äôs Warehouse. They can‚Äôt tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don‚Äôt care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it‚Äôs working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I‚Äôm betting 30k shares that it‚Äôs going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)


Thank you regards for reading this far. The same fundamentals as any other slept-on stock applies to this one. Buy and hold, check the next interest report coming out on 09/15, etcetera. If any oldheads read this post, please fact check my ass. I'm trying to navigate this into as much profit as I can possibly take myself.

1ndyrdb,stocks,"$SOUN,¬†$OPEN, $RR","Been watching on $SOUN,¬†$OPEN, $RR for a while. I‚Äôve got a few things to point out:

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It‚Äôs still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR‚Äôs robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn‚Äôt guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

I also do know to keep the 500 dollars, I‚Äôd have to hold my money in Robinhood for 5 years, which I don‚Äôt really plan on taking money out anyway.

In Robinhood, I‚Äôd probably just hold VTI because they do not have VTSAX, and I feel like one huge advantage to this is being able to buy IPOs when they release, as they seem to be constantly doubling these days. Also, Robinhood makes it significantly easier to sell and buy shares of stock.

Also, robinhood allows me to trade with like 100k margin or something crazy along those lines. Would it not just be smart to throw that in an index fund?",1,53,2025-09-11 03:25:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndye8q/vanguard_vs_robinhood_should_i_switch/,2025-09-25 02:29:58.147406

1ndt2go,stocks,"CDTX ‚Äì Is their CD388 ‚Äúuniversal flu prophylaxis‚Äù the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?","New to reddit and looking for a second set of eyes on one of my investments.

I‚Äôve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a ‚Äúuniversal flu med‚Äù for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share √ó ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 ‚Üí ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) ‚Üí ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV ‚Üí $445‚Äì530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just ‚Äúclinical-stage biotech = high risk‚Äù until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they‚Äôre positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7‚Äì8√ó upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

1ndkcue,stocks,WeRide ‚Äì Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let‚Äôs talk about a ticker nobody‚Äôs giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‚Äò25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That‚Äôs now over a third of their total business ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúpilot program‚Äù anymore, it‚Äôs a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can‚Äôt say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn‚Äôt just marketing fluff ‚Äì it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‚Äò24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops ‚Äì regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide‚Äôs tech is getting plugged into Uber‚Äôs and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this ‚Äì WeRide isn‚Äôt just pushing one product. They‚Äôve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They‚Äôre building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn‚Äôt mooning *yet*. They‚Äôre still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks ‚Äì grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I‚Äôm still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that‚Äôll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",24,11,2025-09-10 17:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.008878

1ndeclp,stocks,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn‚Äôt come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom‚Äôs revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is¬† excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue ‚Äì¬†**Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom‚Äôs Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom‚Äôs strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:**¬†The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management‚Äôs confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom‚Äôs sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:**¬†Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet ‚Äúas one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,‚Äù and Broadcom‚Äôs Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:**¬†VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:**¬†Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:**¬†Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50‚Äì60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom‚Äôs 2026‚Äôs AI growth to ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.¬† Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom‚Äôs success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom‚Äôs biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",29,8,2025-09-10 13:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.008926

1nd8ojp,stocks,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

1nd7rzv,stocks,Oil settles higher after Israeli attack on Qatar,"[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-settles-higher-after-israeli-attack-qatar-2025-09-09/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-settles-higher-after-israeli-attack-qatar-2025-09-09/)

NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher on Tuesday after the Israeli military said it¬†carried out an attack¬†on Hamas leadership in the Qatari capital Doha, an expansion of its military actions in the¬†Middle East.

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that¬†China¬†will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against¬†Russia.",31,1,2025-09-10 07:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.008957

1nd1djr,stocks,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify‚Äôs size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‚Äòs in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I‚Äôm conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what‚Äôs also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft‚Äôs cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",58,27,2025-09-10 01:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.008987

1nctxgv,stocks,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle¬†shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†$1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it¬†signed an agreement¬†with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to¬†Nvidia‚Äôs¬†graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google‚Äôs Gemini artificial intelligence models would¬†become available¬†on Oracle‚Äôs cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday‚Äôs close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

> U.S. employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously thought, indicating the labor market may have been significantly weaker than initial estimates had suggested. The U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in March than previously estimated, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Tuesday. The figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. The preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data. 

> The fresh data comes weeks after President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in response to a weak monthly jobs report. Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons.

I asked her for the phone number of the man who's been helping her sell it. She gave me a fake number. This was the first red flag. So I did some research and apparently, there is supposed to be a legend on the back of a stock certificate. The back of mine is completely blank. The front names the company, the amount of shares, and their value. The second red flag is that, if her shares are valued at the same as mine are, there is no way she has been able to receive as much money as she has. She has no other streams of income.

If large dark pool activity happens far away from the publick price (like outside the bolligner bands) then the DPs seem to act as a repellent the and price moves away from them. That seems totally backwards, because I would think the the public price would move towards the DPs, but the patter seems to hold.

Sarepta stock is down almost 90% due to two deaths related to its flagship gene therapy, Elevidys. It‚Äôs an expensive but highly unique solution to give children suffering from DMD a chance at a better life. 

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it‚Äôs still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they‚Äôre allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits. However, there is also a chance that it goes to $0 if their drug is permanently pulled for everyone (small chance, but not zero).",7,11,2025-09-09 15:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nclmnh/srpt_binary_outcome/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009057
1ncj0ng,stocks,"Why are all EVTOLs posts focusing on Joby/Archer, while EH seems at least as promising, if not better ?","Every week there are new threads on this sub trying to pump Archer, and occasionally Joby, but I feel like the discourse here completely overlooks EHang, which is to me a much safer bet for the following reasons 


**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang‚Äôs strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

1ncin8g,stocks,(09/9) Interesting Stocks Today - The Real Winner of Succession is...,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Murdoch‚Äôs $3.3 Billion Succession Deal Hands Lachlan Control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/murdoch-family-settles-suit-over-trust-puts-lachlan-in-charge?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NBIS (Nebius)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)\- Nebius said it signed a multibillion‚Äëdollar agreement to provide Microsoft with artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately spiked up to $110 yesterday and made a MASSIVE move afterhours, I'm primarily interested in seeing if we can continue that today. Watching $100 level. The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR. Does this have as much potential as CRCL? I'd say no, but I think that it is an interesting watch. The surge of crypto‚Äëindustry IPOs sparked by Circle‚Äôs $1.05‚ÄØB listing has been part of the IPO market coming back. FIGR is aiming for an IPO that is half its size, and is decently profitable. Planning to write a DD on this. Main risk in this is that we get absolutely euphoric (we're already very euphoric in the IPO market lol).

[**FOX (Fox Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FOX&p=d)\- Lachlan Murdoch has won the game of Succession and the stock has drifted somewhat lower on this news-but it was done on such little volume we‚Äôll have to wait until the market opens to see if FOX will stay down 5%.

[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\- Day‚ÄØ2 of being added (or at least, notifying everyone it will be added) to the S&P‚ÄØ500! primarily interested in if it can continue the momentum and break ATH (\~$117/\~117.70). TLDR stocks go up when added to the S&P 500 because index‚Äëtracking funds and ETFs are forced to buy in.

1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It‚Äôs survived wave after wave of ‚Äúthis app is dead‚Äù & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1ncdql0,stocks,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited. We should neither dismiss it as useless nor praise it blindly.",30,34,2025-09-09 08:54:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ncdql0/thoughts_on_spacexs_acquisition_of_echostar/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009123

1nbwetv,stocks,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,90,2025-09-08 18:54:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009134

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA. So this would mainly impact the retaliatory tariffs levied against every country",1492,215,2025-09-08 15:03:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbq5q9/treasury_secretary_bessent_warns_of_massive/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009155

1nbm4tr,stocks,Motley called Archer a no-brainer industrial pick. Good things all around for the stock,"In their September 5 report, AOL labeled Archer Aviation as one of two industrial stocks worth considering right now, and for good reason

Although still early stage, Archer‚Äôs push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù reflects growing recognition that Archer‚Äôs mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it‚Äôs steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling. 
It‚Äôs not just about flying taxis, it‚Äôs the transformation of urban and regional travel. That feels worth paying attention to, and keeping a positive lens on as we ride this story forward

1nbc2vz,stocks,"Perpetua Resources is Being Added to the S&P/TSX as of Sept 22, 2025 (Materials, Gold)","[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/p-dow-jones-indices-announces-211500983.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/p-dow-jones-indices-announces-211500983.html)

If you recall, PPTA is on the verge of getting their final permits signed off. As well as gold, the property holds enough Antimony to supply up to 37% of the USA's requirements. America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",20,3,2025-09-08 02:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009200
1nb2fdy,stocks,"ASML becomes Mistral AI‚Äôs top shareholder after leading latest funding round, sources say","ASML, a crucial supplier of advanced chipmaking equipment, is set to become the top shareholder of French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI in a move to strengthen European tech sovereignty, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The Dutch ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for Mistral‚Äôs 1.7 billion euro (\~$2 billion) fundraise and is expected to get a board seat at Mistral, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

The round will make Mistral the most valuable AI company in Europe with a 10-billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pre-money valuation in its latest Series C funding round, the people said.

ASML declined to comment. Mistral did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

1nazqw0,stocks,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day‚Äôs low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don‚Äôt see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That‚Äôs the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It‚Äôs arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** ‚Äì The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don‚Äôt jump in because the Fed will cut in September ‚Äì that‚Äôs already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What‚Äôs not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don‚Äôt chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we‚Äôre trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally. The AI, semiconductor and cloud sectors, have already reached high valuations, and I would bet on a broad market correction.",235,141,2025-09-07 17:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nazqw0/the_weak_payroll_report_of_only_22000_jobs_is_bad/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009224

1natkef,stocks,"Everyone seems to be bearish, what percent do you think the s&p will drop?","The housing market now has 500,000 more sellers than buyers. The largest gap ever recorded. 

Valuations higher than the dot com bubble. 

Job creation numbers keep being adjusted to the downside. There are more Americans out of work than there are jobs available.

4 out of the last 5 years, September has been one of the worst months of the year for the s&p.

1napdma,stocks,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I‚Äôve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¬¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that‚Äôs what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have üöÄ on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¬¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here‚Äôs the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months.¬†

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40‚Äì50% downdraft.¬†

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that‚Äôs all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here‚Äôs the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren‚Äôt buying at $6‚Äì7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - ‚ÄúI will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.‚Äù Here‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù (look it up) - the price might actually drop.¬†
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won‚Äôt wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

*Update:* I edited the post to add a few points I had cut earlier for brevity, as it seems folk had interest in what I had to say.",337,129,2025-09-07 10:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1napdma/open_reality_check_from_someone_who_actually/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009257

1na2xhp,stocks,"Record $7.4 Trillion in cash on the sidelines, will dip buyers prevent the next crash?","There is currently a record **$7.4 trillion sitting in money market funds and cash equivalents**. Some argue this could provide a strong floor for equities since there‚Äôs so much ‚Äúdry powder‚Äù ready to buy the dip. Others point out that investors often hesitate to deploy cash during sharp selloffs, waiting until markets have already recovered before stepping in.

Do you think this cash hoard will actually help stabilize the market during downturns, or is it more likely to sit on the sidelines until after the damage is done?

1n9n3w3,stocks,Nestle has fired its CEO because he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpm9ee9p9o

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld. A spokesperson for Nestle said: ""We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance.",1553,133,2025-09-06 01:38:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9n3w3/nestle_has_fired_its_ceo_because_he_failed_to/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009328
1n9jpac,stocks,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

- Climate change and increase in CATs, most recently Palisades",3,14,2025-09-05 22:57:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9jpac/kinsale_capital_group_knsl_expensive_on_the/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009333

1n9dojz,stocks,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing? Oh SpaceX.... if it wasn't for Gwynne Shotwell it would be a dumpster fire.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google was fined almost ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

‚ÄúWhen markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,‚Äù EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. ‚ÄúTrue freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.‚Äù

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move ‚Äúimposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.‚Äù

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU‚ÄìUS trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc‚Äôs efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google‚Äôs adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company‚Äôs central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera‚Äôs predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a ‚Äúmandatory divestment‚Äù of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than ‚Ç¨8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",716,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009393
1n96qiw,stocks,$LULU - has it bottomed?,"Yes, cheeky title.

You may remember me from such classics as ‚Äú$LULU - the bar is low‚Äù where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn‚Äôt the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick‚Äôs own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can‚Äôt just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn‚Äôt succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it‚Äôs at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they‚Äôve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They‚Äôre spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it‚Äôs not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable.

1n92hmm,stocks,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it‚Äôs worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?",56,53,2025-09-05 11:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n92hmm/achr_discussion_can_evtols_ever_be_profitable/,2025-09-25 02:30:00.009427

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

There‚Äôs a ton of analysis from marketing professionals praising Gap‚Äôs ability to capture the momentum from the Sydney Sweeney ad and put out something that appears to be much more successful and effective. 

Gap has been on an uptrend since their last earnings, and I‚Äôm confident the virality of the Katseye ad paired with the now proven effectiveness of the Sydney Sweeney ad through AEO‚Äôs earnings will keep Gap‚Äôs momentum going. I don‚Äôt think the market has appropriately priced in the potential effectiveness of the Katseye ad converting into sales, and $AEO‚Äôs last earnings provide some confirmation that more positive sentiment is justified. 

P/E is only 9.73, and market cap is about 8 billion. There is room to move.

Highlights:

> * **BYD has slashed its sales target for this year by as much as 16% to 4.6 million vehicles**, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as **the Chinese EV giant faces its slowest annual growth in five years and other signs that its era of record-setting expansion could be drawing to a close.**

> * The people didn't give a reason for the cut. However, one of them said it comes as BYD feels the heat from growing competition with rivals such as Geely Auto and Leapmotor.
>
> * Last week, **BYD reported a 30% drop in quarterly profit, its first decline in more than three years.**
> 

>* **The new target represents a 7% increase from last year** and would be **the slowest annual growth since 2020, when sales fell by 7%.**

> * **In the first eight months of this year, BYD has only met some 52% of its original 5.5 million vehicle sales target.**

Meanwhile, the market is underappreciating the rising quality of Google‚Äôs ad leads, which will cause pricing to go up, providing another tailwind for the stock.

Mahaney‚Äôs current price target for the stock sits at $240 per share, implying an upside of 13%. But he believes shares could eventually rise to around the $300 level, which is approximately 42% than where shares are currently trading.

Mahaney added that this ruling is also a ‚Äúbig win‚Äù for Apple.

‚ÄúThis has clearly been an overhang on Apple stock, and now they‚Äôve got this almost guaranteed $20, $25 billion a year, and super high margin revenue coming their way thanks to Google,‚Äù he said.

1n7q8at,stocks,Salesforce issues weak revenue guidance even as earnings beat estimates,"Salesforce¬†issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, even as earnings and revenue topped estimates for the fiscal second quarter. The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†$2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected

Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.

For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.

Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to¬† $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.

Salesforce has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software and systems, it hasn‚Äôt been lifted by the AI boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.

Going into Wednesday‚Äôs report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year,¬†lagging¬†behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.

The ratio of Salesforce‚Äôs enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.

During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to¬†increase the cost¬†of some products and announced its¬†intent to acquire¬†data management software company¬†Informatica¬†for $8 billion.

1n7q103,stocks,Figma‚Äôs stock plunges after company‚Äôs first earnings report since IPO,"Figma¬†shares plunged 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the design software company reported results for the first time since its IPO in July.

Here‚Äôs how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†breakeven
* **Revenue:**¬†$249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected

Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July¬†regulatory filing. CNBC isn‚Äôt including a profit estimate because it‚Äôs Figma‚Äôs first earnings report.

Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company‚Äôs adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.

For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.

The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little over $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.

In the second quarter, Figma announced¬†Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user‚Äôs descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.

A number of software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said he‚Äôs not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.

‚ÄúI think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,‚Äù Field said. He acknowledged that Figma has been adopting so-called¬†vibe-coding tools¬†for AI-driven software development.

Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.

Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% some employees‚Äô stock after market close on Sept. 4. Investors holding just over half of Figma‚Äôs outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lock-up that will expire in August 2026 for about 35% of their shares.

Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that I think is valuable information,‚Äù he said.

On Wednesday the company‚Äôs stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to¬†$115.50¬†in its debut.

1n7pve1,stocks,"American Eagle stock soars 20% as it says Sydney Sweeney campaign is its ‚Äòbest‚Äô to date, beats earnings","American Eagle¬†said Wednesday its¬†partnership with Sydney Sweeney¬†has been its ‚Äúbest‚Äù advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations.¬†

The company‚Äôs splashy,¬†yet controversial, campaign with the ‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift‚Äôs new fianc√©¬†Travis Kelce,¬†has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels.¬†

American Eagle stock soared more than 20% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

‚ÄúThe fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,‚Äù CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. ‚ÄúWe look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.‚Äù¬†

The company also re-issued its full-year guidance after¬†withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount.¬†

It still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million.¬†

Here‚Äôs how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†45 cents vs. 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$1.28 billion vs. $1.24 billion expected

The company‚Äôs reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.¬†

Sales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier.¬†

For the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It‚Äôs expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.¬†

> WASHINGTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month in August as factories dealt with the fallout from the Trump administration's import tariffs, with some manufacturers describing the current business environment as ""much worse than the Great Recession.""
> 
> The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also showed some manufacturers complaining that the sweeping import duties were making it difficult to manufacture goods in the United States. President Donald Trump has defended his protectionist trade policy, which has raised the nation's average tariff rate to the highest in a century, as necessary to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base.
> 
> That was reinforced by government data showing spending on the construction of factories dropped in July and was down 6.7% from a year ago. A U.S. appeals court ruled last Friday that most of Trump's tariffs were illegal, adding more uncertainty for businesses.
> 
> ""I continue to see the broad economy generally and the manufacturing sector in particular as in a holding pattern until tariff-related uncertainty recedes,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander U.S. Capital Markets.
> 
> The ISM said its manufacturing PMI edged up to 48.7 last month from 48.0 in July. A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2% of the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PMI would rise to 49.0.
> 
> Seven industries, including textile mills, miscellaneous manufacturing and primary metals, reported growth last month. Among the 10 industries reporting contraction were makers of paper products, machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as computer and electronic products.
> 
> Tariffs continued to dominate commentary from manufacturers. Some makers of transportation equipment said conditions were worse than the 2007-09 recession, adding ""there is absolutely no activity"" and ""this is 100 percent attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created."" Some viewed the conditions as consistent with ""stagflation.""
> 
> Some electrical equipment, appliances and components producers complained that ""'made in the USA' has become even more difficult due to tariffs on many components."" They said the ""administration wants manufacturing jobs in the U.S., but we are losing higher-skilled and higher-paying roles."" Others reported that because of the lack of ""stability in trade and economics, capital expenditures spending and hiring are frozen.""
> 
> Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said ""tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning and scheduling activities,"" adding that ""plans to bring production back into (the) U.S. are impacted by higher material costs, making it more difficult to justify the return.""",388,33,2025-09-03 17:46:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n7lo8f/us_manufacturing_contracts_for_sixth_straight/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854510

1n7h3cq,stocks,Webull is undervalued by around 3x vs. Other brokerages. Nice value,"Webull (BULL) is crazy undervalued vs. Other brokerages

Webull (BULL) is currently trading around 13.2/share. It IPOd on 11Apr right at market lows. There was immediate interest sending the IPO price from $12 to $60, then a sell off to $11. 

Financials: 
Revenue Q1 = $117M
Revenue Q2 = $131.5M
Q3 projection = $150M 

Yes they have competition from other brokerages, but their market edge is lower trading fees and easy to use app. They now also permit other forms of trading which im not allowed to specify on this sub. 

So why webull? 

If you do a simple Revenue vs. Market cap comparison of brokerages, Webull is by far the most undervalued brokerage - likely because they recently had smaller market exposure pre-IPO and the IPO timing was horrible. 

Webull would be trading at $39/share using a revenue vs market cap vs. Share price comparison to other brokerages (aggregate). 

In other words, if Webulls financials were treated the same as other brokerages, it should simply be close to $40/share. 

$13/share is outrageously undervalued for this brokerage. Time and value will realize itself and Webull will be trading at $40/share soon.

It was your typical softball interview but there was one question that I thought was interesting.  He was asked if inflation continues to creep up and given that it is currently above the Fed's target rate would that cause the Fed to possibly not cut rates.  Waller proceeded to lecture the audience that what people don't understand is ""see through inflation"".  He said people don't understand that this is just temporary and caused by tariffs and you need to see through it and it will soon go away.  I guess by magic,  he didn't say what would cause it to go away. 

I was hoping that Leishman would bring up transitory inflation,  but no such luck. 

I think inflation continues to go up and employment goes down.  Not a good formula for stocks.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just well positioned right now for the environment we‚Äôre in to take share, to deliver for our customers and to provide a better experience,‚Äù CEO Tony Spring told CNBC in an interview.

Last quarter, the company said it was hiking prices of certain products to offset tariff costs. Spring said Wednesday that the company now has tariff impacts included in its outlook and remains cautiously optimistic about the future.

‚ÄúTariffs are real. It‚Äôs a component of the business, but we have tail winds that we are trying to mitigate against those headwinds,‚Äù Spring said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a better customer experience, that‚Äôs a newer assortment, that‚Äôs less redundancy in our assortment, that‚Äôs now a business that‚Äôs growing across all three nameplates in our portfolio and a healthy inventory position going into the fall season.‚Äù

Spring added that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion.

Macy‚Äôs said it saw its best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, and Spring said the retailer‚Äôs strategy is leaning into business segments that are working to keep its momentum going, including growth in denim, women‚Äôs contemporary apparel and watches.

Here‚Äôs how the company performed during its fiscal second quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†41 cents¬†adjusted vs. 18 cents expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$4.81 billion vs. $4.76 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Aug. 2, the company‚Äôs net income was $87 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $150 million, or 53 cents per share, the year prior. Net sales dropped from $4.94 billion in the year-ago period to $4.81 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were 41 cents.

Macy‚Äôs said the group of 125 stores that the company has chosen to focus on with higher staffing and renovations, outperformed the broader Macy‚Äôs brand, seeing comparable sales growth of 1.1% on an owned basis.

The department store also owns Bloomingdale‚Äôs, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.6% on an owned basis, and Bluemercury, which saw comparable sales rise 1.2%.¬†Those two brands have consistently performed better than the Macy‚Äôs namesake stores.

The company also reported a $28 million increase in credit card net revenue to $153 million.

‚ÄúWhen you think about the strength of a department store or a marketplace, it‚Äôs when multiple categories are working,‚Äù Spring said Wednesday.

CFO Tom Edwards said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Macy‚Äôs is exploring more price hikes on certain products because of tariffs.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre adjusting prices, but as appropriate, not broad-based and really assessing it with our partners in an effort to remain competitive,‚Äù Edwards said. ‚ÄúI believe that we are really well positioned to navigate through this time given our business model.‚Äù

1n7f1zl,stocks,BNPL is taking a chunk out of the credit card business with high momentum growth year over year.,"BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) payment options offered by companies such as SoFi, Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, Block, PayPal, Sezzle, Shop Pay, etc, offer interest-free purchase options split into several payments. Merchants, such as Walmart, Amazon, and many more, love BNPL because people tend to purchase more items, as well as items they don't immediately need.  In fact, they're willing to pay 3% to 8% fee for BNPL operating companies to complete the purchase, which would be substantially more than the credit card fee of 2 to 3%.  On top of the merchants' fees, BNPL has strict late fees and a high interest rate for late payments.

The BNPL market reached $340 billion globally in 2024 and continues to grow year over year. In 2024, 86.5 million Americans used BNPL services across retail categories. Shoppers spent $18.2 billion using BNPL during the 2024 holiday season alone.  BNPL Payments to Grow by 13.7% to Surpass $560 billion this Year.

1n7ejyn,stocks,Markets are at record highs. Which growth stocks still have room in H2 2025? Here are 5 with surprising data,"The S&P and Nasdaq are sitting near record highs‚Ä¶but not every growth stock has run as hard as the mega-caps. Some names are showing double digit sales growth and EPS momentum while still trading below their 2021 peak valuations‚Ä¶

Here are a few that stood out to me (data from Finviz / company filings):

APP (Applovin): +36% YTD; EPS +102% this year; sales growth +34% YoY; forward P/E ~32.8

DASH (DoorDash): +47% YTD; EPS up ~750%; revenue +23.8% YoY; forward P/E ~63

CVNA (Carvana): +76% YTD; EPS growth +170%; sales +39.5% YoY; forward P/E ~117

NET (Cloudflare): +82% YTD; +138% 1-year return; forward P/E ~176.7

PINS (Pinterest): EPS +41%; profit margin ~49%; sales +17% YoY; forward P/E ~16.6

These are all strong movers, but the valuations range wildly‚Ä¶Some look like they still have room to run, while others may already be stretched‚Ä¶

Which of these growth names do you think can still outperform in H2?

Do high forward P/Es make them too risky at these levels, or are fundamentals strong enough to justify it?

1n7bhcq,stocks,Auto Parts Retailers:  Teflon-like Stocks?,"How about stocks like O'Reilly (ORLY) and Autozone (AZO)?   Like some other retailers with low or no dividends they trade at very high PE multiples.  Their share prices have been bullet-proof, no doubt bolstered by the increasing average age of cars in the US.   But, take ORLY for example at a PE of 37 and market cap of $88 billion (bigger than either Ford or GM or Cummins).

Net income 2021 - 2024 up from $2.16 to $2.39 billion (only 10% increase).  CPI inflation is more than that (18.5% since Dec-2021).   This even when their store count is up by over 10% over the same period.  They are not growing like a tech company despite their 37 PE.

Long term debt up from $3.8  -  $5.5 billion (50% increase).

Their earnings per share have increased, as they buy back shares rather then pay dividends.  Though it seems like much of those purchases are funded by added debt.   That has worked out for them as their share price has gone from \~$50 then  to >$100 today, but I wonder if share buybacks at $100 will look so wise in the future.

Insider transactions seem to be tilted to selling ($9 million recently by a senior VP).

Articles talk about them having a moat.  Maybe, but I think it is about as wide the frontage road between them and the neighboring Autozone, Advance Auto Parts, or NAPA store.

I am betting against them maintaining a multiple of 37.",11,3,2025-09-03 10:48:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n7bhcq/auto_parts_retailers_teflonlike_stocks/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854558

‚ÄúWe will begin driving manually before validating our technology and operations for fully autonomous services in the future,‚Äù a company spokesperson said in an email. Waymo announced the tests in¬†blog posts.

The autonomous vehicle venture aims to expand its driverless, ride-hailing service across the U.S. after already launching commercial operations in Austin, Texas, as well as Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

In some markets, including Austin and Atlanta, Waymo‚Äôs driverless rides can only be hailed through the¬†Uber¬†app. In others, riders must use the company‚Äôs standalone Waymo One app to book a robotaxi.

Safety drivers, who are employees of Waymo, will man the steering and braking behind the test vehicles in Denver and Seattle. The company is also running similar tests with its robotaxis in New York, having recently obtained permits in the biggest U.S. market.

The company‚Äôs test fleet in Denver and in Seattle will include a mix of their fully electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr AVs.

Waymo told CNBC that it will have up to a dozen cars each in Denver and Seattle to start testing.

Waymo‚Äôs primary competition on the global stage is¬†Baidu-owned Apollo Go in China, which operates driverless ride-hailing services throughout Asia. Meanwhile,¬†Tesla¬†has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing business in Texas, and is testing a manned robotaxi service in Austin and another in San Francisco.

1n6udom,stocks,"September feels heavy: seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed nerves all hitting at once","The market kicked off weak this week with the Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow all sliding lower. Honestly, it feels like there are too many headwinds piling up at the same time, and no one can agree on which one is the real driver.

September is usually a bad month for stocks anyway, especially for tech. Maybe this is just the classic seasonal slump playing out. But it also feels like the other stuff going on is making it worse. A federal appeals court just ruled most of Trump‚Äôs tariffs were illegal, which doesn‚Äôt kill tariffs forever but does leave everything messy. Nobody knows what the new rules will look like, which goods are impacted, or if companies might even get refunds for what‚Äôs already been collected. That kind of limbo is exactly what markets hate.

Then there‚Äôs the government shutdown risk. Congress has until September 30 to figure it out, and the odds of a shutdown are being thrown around at 40 percent. If it happens, you could see cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would ripple through the economy. Maybe they pass a short-term patch that drags this into December, but even the back-and-forth in DC is enough to make investors nervous.

The Fed adds another layer. Nobody‚Äôs sure what their next move is, and stocks entered September priced for perfection, so the bar is high. When valuations are stretched like this, even a little bit of bad news can knock things down. Add in the jobs report coming on Friday, and you‚Äôve got another potential swing factor hanging over the week.

So yeah, between seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed uncertainty, the market just feels heavy right now. I‚Äôm curious what everyone thinks is weighing the most. Are you making moves in your portfolio, or just sitting back and treating this like a normal September dip that will pass?",67,36,2025-09-02 20:19:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6udom/september_feels_heavy_seasonality_tariffs/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854598

Option 2, peg gold at an extremely high price like $130K per ounce to wipe out the deficit.  This would make the dollar practically worthless.

Option 3, we remain a fiat currency.  According to the Triffin dilemma, we have to continue running trade deficits so the world can accumulate enough dollars to create liquidity.

The bigger question is what this says about the consumer. If people are pulling back on beer, even from a major player like STZ, does that mean discretionary spending is weakening more broadly?

The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with¬†Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game.

‚ÄúAs a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true,‚Äù David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. ‚ÄúFrom the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I‚Äôve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.‚Äù

Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand‚Äôs ‚Äúrich narrative and distinctive style‚Äù for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally.

‚ÄúI can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,‚Äù Ellison said.

The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount¬†since it officially merged with Skydance¬†in early August. Weeks later the studio announced it had¬†signed The Duffer Brothers,¬†the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúStranger Things,‚Äù to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Paramount also¬†bought the U.S. rights to UFC¬†in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal that starts in 2026.

1n6lf3n,stocks,Warren Buffett says he is ‚Äòdisappointed‚Äô in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the¬†Kraft Heinz¬†split¬†that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz‚Äôs largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the¬†2015 merger¬†that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett‚Äôs comments.

Buffett told CNBC‚Äôs Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn‚Äôt turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett‚Äôs stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz.¬†3G Capital quietly exited¬†its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company‚Äôs slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire‚Äôs future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by¬†artificial intelligence.

‚ÄúIt is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,‚Äù Musk said in the company‚Äôs second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it‚Äôs behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while¬†Alphabet‚Äôs¬†Waymo is live in numerous markets and¬†reached 10 million paid trips¬†in May.¬†Baidu‚Äôs¬†Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like¬†Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for ‚Äúbuilds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.‚Äù

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla‚Äôs¬†vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his¬†departure¬†in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.

1n6izzb,stocks,"Pepsi shares jump 5% as activist Elliott takes $4 billion stake, sees ‚Äòhistoric‚Äô value opportunity","PepsiCo¬†shares popped Tuesday after Elliott Investment Management took a significant stake as the activist investor sees a ‚Äúrare‚Äù and ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù opportunity for a turnaround in the iconic soft drink giant.

Shares of PepsiCo climbed more than 5% in premarket trading. The stock is down about 2% this year, significantly lagging the broader market.

The Paul Singer-founded Elliott‚Äôs bet in Pepsi is worth $4 billion, becoming the consumer giant‚Äôs top five active investors excluding index funds, according to FactSet. The activist investor sent a presentation and letter to Pepsi‚Äôs board of directors Tuesday, detailing a clear agenda focused on restoring business momentum.

‚ÄúWhile unfortunate, this disappointing trajectory has created a historic opportunity: With the right mindset and an appropriately ambitious turnaround plan, PepsiCo today represents a rare chance to revitalize a leading global enterprise and unlock significant shareholder value,‚Äù Elliott wrote in its letter.

The Wall Street Journal first reported¬†Elliott‚Äôs new stake earlier Tuesday.

Elliott said it hopes to work together to help Pepsi build on its legacy of success and achieve its full potential.

Pepsi has been cutting costs and trying to improve its profit margins. The company closed two manufacturing plants for its North American food business during the quarter. Pepsi said it is trying to make its transportation and logistics more efficient. The company is also evaluating how it spends its marketing dollars to make sure it is getting the best return on its investment.

In July, Pepsi reported¬†quarterly¬†earnings¬†and revenue¬†that topped analysts‚Äô expectations, as the company projected that weak North American demand will rebound as strategy changes take hold.

Elliott has a history of activism that has at times yielded strong returns for investors. It‚Äôs a large holder of Phillips 66 and Southwest Airlines and has been driving changes at those two companies.

The firm was also famously involved in a 15-year legal battle against the government of Argentina over defaulted bonds. Elliott ended up getting¬†a settlement payment of $2.4 billion, representing a massive return on its initial investment.¬†

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1n6cctp,stocks,Looking for feedback for my stock portfolio,"Hi folks! I'm looking for some feedback and looking for some discussion around my current stock portfolio!

I understand that most people don't out-perform the market (SP500, etc,.) over the long-term but I personally enjoy investing and want to generate some out-performance/alpha in my own individual portfolio in the long-term. In my retirement accounts (Roth IRA + 401k), I hold 100% SP500 index funds so these stocks are only held in my taxable individual account.

I'm still learning a-lot and my investment philosophy is still evolving (most recently by consuming a lot of content by Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Chris Hohn, Dev Kantesaria, and Bill Ackman) so there's actually a good number of stocks here that I actually don't want to own anymore - but am looking at a more opportune time to sell them. 

My current holdings are roughly (figures are rounded):

**Amazon (AMZN) - 19%** \- Have always liked AMZN as it's been a company with a diversified set of businesses with mostly good business models and are dominant in many of those areas. Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it‚Äôs my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven‚Äôt had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I‚Äôm debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

1n66n5d,stocks,PLTR will be like TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency,"Listen up.

Palantir is getting ready to launch. Let‚Äôs unravel this now. 

- Peter Thiel is a co-founder of of PLTR

- Thiel and JD vance have been close comrades for more than a DECADE, with much business done.

- Orange man appears to be unwell, with many twitter news outlets depicting orange man looking not so energetic, and Vance himself stated ‚Äúhe‚Äôs ready to be president‚Äù (while praising orange man‚Äôs health). Read between the lines: he is, infact, not in good health. 

- If orange man dies, Vance becomes president. This propels PLTR to be the president‚Äôs stock, just as TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency. Tesla kept going up, until tensions between trump and musk were getting bad.

Thus, PLTR should hit new highs and above in the next 6 months.",0,28,2025-09-02 01:29:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n66n5d/pltr_will_be_like_tsla_was_at_the_beginning_of/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854707
1n63agc,stocks,"Powell at Jackson Hole may have underestimated the destructive impact of tariffs on inflation, the economy, and jobs.","Just thinking about Powell‚Äôs Jackson Hole speech makes me furious.
The whole thing reads like he was covering for Trump.

First came his affirmation of inflation control, basically downplaying current inflation risks  in reality, PCE is trending upward, PPI is surging.

Most importantly, he framed tariff-driven inflation as ‚Äúusually one-off‚Äù right at the start. The possibility that tariff inflation could be persistent and requires monitoring was left until the very end  giving the market the impression that tariffs‚Äô damage to inflation is limited. This massively underestimates the fact that tariffs are not simply ‚Äúcollect 10% more, firms raise prices exactly 10% for a short time.‚Äù In a competitive industry, pricing decisions are shaped simultaneously by peers‚Äô pricing, consumer tolerance, and whether intense competition forces firms to absorb costs. Without any anchor, both the scale and the duration of price hikes become completely unpredictable. From various reports, it‚Äôs clear many firms still don‚Äôt even know how to price.

He emphasized downside risks to employment and said policy would adjust  the source of the rate cut signal. But he never explained why employment is falling. The whole speech gave the impression that rate cuts can rescue jobs  completely ignoring the fact that many reports point out firms are hesitant to hire precisely because of Trump‚Äôs chaotic tariffs. On top of that, Trump‚Äôs removal of 1.4 million immigrants from construction and hospitality has also significantly hit nonfarm payrolls.

Right now GDP is sending signals completely opposite to nonfarm employment.

The entire speech brushed off the destructive nature of tariffs, leaving the impression that rate cuts could solve it. Even if the economy is slowing, I completely oppose rate cuts. Powell is drastically underestimating the damage tariffs inflict on global supply chains. Once even a single chain collapses under tariff pressure, the shock will ultimately transmit back to the U.S. And the chilling effect on domestic investment could also be significant.

Most importantly, all of this is unknown. We are now facing the largest trade war in history, with no sufficient historical data to gauge the impact. The Fed‚Äôs most rational choice is to preserve ammunition, wait for enough time and data, and intervene swiftly and effectively only when a situation arises that rate cuts can genuinely fix. But if they waste all their ammunition now, at a time when the outlook is uncertain and the data contradictory, then when the real crisis hits, the Fed will have nothing left but to lie flat and give up.

Powell should have used Jackson Hole to stress the destructive nature of tariffs and the Fed‚Äôs caution  to make the market understand where responsibility truly lies and what the Fed can and cannot do. Instead, he left the market thinking tariffs could be solved by rate cuts. An economic storm triggered by trade policy must be handled by the culprit itself. This is a severe misallocation of responsibility.

Summary: The Fed should prepare for the worst rather than speculate optimistically.

Defining tariffs as one-time events is utterly absurd; the Fed should not speculate on events with no historical data.

Even if they truly were one-time, this behavior is still highly negligent, as it relies entirely on luck.

1n5u4rr,stocks,Bull Thesis UAL & DAL,"As i'm following airlines stock for a while theres seems to be an uptrend in the stock movement with some bullish catalysts looming, therefore i will present some bullet potential move for airlines, mainly legacy carriers;

* Business travel is back, there seems to be a trend that will normalize business travel back to pre covid era, and this was mentioned by United airlines CEO, Delta Ceo, and also Frontier .
* Business seats and Preimum seats are in demand, as more Americans prefer to pay 500$ \~ 1000$ more for a premium seat in an international flight or less in domestic. in general there are more rich people like all the diamond hands that bought palantir for 10$.
* 2026 Year of the world cup, maybe some of you dont know but the world cup is a huge deal all over the world, and this will bring huge huge amount of traffic during Q2 and Q4, flights will be fully booked with priced jacked up like crazy, there will be tons of Rich Europens and Rich arabs flying all over. This effect will produce a very high guidance.
* Consolidationin of the airlines market - Just in friday spirit airlines announced another chapter 11 bankruptcy, they even sent this message of bankruptcy to all of theyre customers, while they didn't ceased operations no customer will take a chance flying with them anytime soon, and the odds of spirit survivng this second chapter 11 is low. So there will be one less airline meaning more demand and higher prices, if you remmber there was also a merger between Alaska airlines and Hawian that took place last year. so the trend is clear less airlines and more mergers/bankruptcy.
* DAL p/e is 9 and UAL is 10 both airlines carry decent amount of debt, some are correlated to the leasing of jets and some is pure debt so take it as a risk. The margins of both airlines is in the 5% but there is a chance this can double or atleast get to 7%.

1n5n5bw,stocks,Rumours of Trump's health and how markets may react,"Thought it may be worth hearing everyone's thoughts and scenarios in the event of Trump's health failing.

My line of thinking is that should Trump face any incapacitation/25th/death, then markets will gap up, with Bitcoin being the proxy if markets are closed. Rationale is that Vance (backed by Thiel and Musk) would not be keen on tariffs and likely to cancel the bulk of them. 

I see the following moves occurring over the few weeks following any such event:

- Treasury yields fall given the cessation of tariffs (less inflationary pressure) 
- Jobs market shows some strength again (hiring as businesses have less uncertainty) 
- Tesla up by 20% or more as Musk will be a huge beneficiary of any Vance presidency
- Indices up 5% or so given less Taco (or none at all)

Won't touch on the chaos that will ensue by all the cabinet members (think death of Stalin), but safe to assume the hyenas will be out.

Every time a dividend hits, there‚Äôs this nice steady return feeling, which is especially comforting when the market‚Äôs a bit shaky. That said, high dividends come with their own risks, some companies pay a lot but may have limited growth potential or shaky finances. Do you usually pay extra attention to high-dividend stocks?

Looking to position my port more heavily towards other sectors that are currently undervalued since the AI bull run started, as well as generally more defensive.  I do believe AI and tech is the future but the valuations are getting a little absurd to me, despite my friends saying otherwise and to keep buying at current levels (PLTR, TSLA, NVIDIA etc).  I've been looking at VNQ, some small cap etfs (seem very undervalued currently), mid cap, healthcare, utilities, energy, GLD, gold mining and others.

1n41ob2,stocks,What is your plan for the Bond ETFs with the upcoming probable rate cut?,"**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):**¬†Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield.¬†
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **TIPS (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)** generally performs well in an Inflationary environment as its principal and interest payments increase with inflation.
* ***SGOV*** **(iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF)** for people who want to park their money and earn an interest rate that is usually higher than a CD without the restrictions of waiting for maturity.

**What is your strategy for the Bond ETFs in light of the probable upcoming rate cut?**

*The most sensitive one with the upcoming rate cut is probably* ***TLT***.

*On the opposite end, there is* ***SGOV*** *for the super conservative who wants to store money like in a bank account.*

1n3xzp0,stocks,KSS still a bargain?,"How did you all feel about KSS when it was $6? Well, here‚Äôs how I felt and I bet a lot of you felt the same way‚Ä¶ 

I looked at that $6 price and felt confident that it wasn‚Äôt going to go much lower than that. I remember thinking: 

‚Äúa 50 % drop is way unlikelier than a 50 % jump. For $3 to happen they would have to declare bankruptcy and there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs happening. For $12 to happen they just need to improve things marginally.‚Äù

Fast forward to today. Does the same logic still apply? I‚Äôm not so sure. A 50 % drop would mean going back to $7.5. Would that require unthinkable devastation such as bankruptcy? No. All it takes might just be disappointing Q3 signaling that the turnaround is going to take much longer than Q2 results had us believe. They said July revenue was flat and that the first month of Q3, August, was going great so far. For Q2 earnings they delivered on all expectations and then some. Hard to find anything that wasn‚Äôt positive other than the ongoing decline in revenue of course but that was very, very, expected. You don‚Äôt go from -5 % expected to +1 % or whatever. 

We‚Äôre riding a 150 % jump since April. 150 % in four months. Everything is different now. There are less Neil Saunders out there now. Most analysts doubled their price targets. People now expect Kohl‚Äôs to succeed. They no longer expect Kohl‚Äôs to go bankrupt. The road from $6 to $15 didn‚Äôt require much good news. Kohl‚Äôs just needed to show everyone that it wasn‚Äôt a dying business. The road from $15 to $30 or even $25 is going to be much harder. They now no longer need to just show they can survive but also that they can compete and win vs peers. 

‚ÄúBlah blah de minimis exemption ending.‚Äù Bro, people that sat on their couch at home buying cheap China stuff on their phones aren‚Äôt going to get up and drive to Kohl‚Äôs instead. They‚Äôll do the next most convenient and cheap thing which is to order from Amazon, Walmart, Fashion Nova, Zara, ASOS or H&M. Or, Chinese e commerce retailers will find a way to stay to adjust and remain the cheapest option. 

‚ÄúBlah blah real estate worth $10 billion.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter at all. Kohl‚Äôs is a retail business not a real estate business. In fact, the Q2 results just made the real estate deep value play way more unlikely because the ‚Äòdying retailer‚Äô threat now seems unthinkable, and Kohl‚Äôs won‚Äôt ever utilize its real estate for income unless it‚Äôs a matter of survival. 

KSS isn‚Äôt on a 50 % discount anymore. It was at $6. Currently, you‚Äôre paying regular price. Odds of it doubling in price are worse than odds of it halving. $7.5 is more likely than $30. 

I‚Äôm a shareholder and have been since January. So what am I going to do? I‚Äôm waiting for $20 because I still can‚Äôt get over not selling on Meme Tuesday July 22 when the stock hit $21. 

I put my faith in what Cramer said yesterday: ‚Äú[KSS] looks to be a meme stock. It‚Äôs up very big. . . .they had news, the quarter was just okay. Just okay.‚Äù",13,3,2025-08-30 10:12:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3xzp0/kss_still_a_bargain/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854833

1n3gv4a,stocks,I want to talk about Nvidia stocks a little bit.,"Nvidia's earnings call was on Wednesday. And to be honest I was quite surprised by the numbers.

46 billion USD in revenue per quarter. And 42.1 billion of it purely from datacenters related business. I.e. selling GPUs primarily. I know they sell NICs and other stuff too. But a big chunk of that money came from GPUs. And that was for a single quarter. Not even 1 whole year.

To put that 46 billion USD number into perspective. Twitter placed an order 100K H100 GPUs one year ago if I remember correctly. 100K x 25K(per GPU) \~= 2.5 billion USD. And that itself was a giant order. And once you spend 2.5 billion dollars on GPUs, there is no chance in hell the company will turn around and buy more GPUs for another 2 to 3 years. Unless the next generation of GPUs show such tremendous performance improvement that they are compelled to buy more GPUs. And let's be honest this is not 1970s that processors can be optimized that much in a year or 2. GPUs are reaching a saturation point in my opinion. Once you buy a light bulb you won't buy a new one unless the current one burns out.

There is a thermal upper limit to how many MOSFETs you can cram on a die. And even the MOSFETs themselves can only be shrunk so much. 4nm feature size MOSFET is an incredibly small MOSFET. An atom itself is like 0.1nm. The MOSFETs we are making today barely have 2000 or so atoms in them if I am not wrong. All of these conclusions arise from Moore's law dying a slow death.

Better architecture is the way these processor manufacturers were able to eek out more performance gains without a die shrink. But at this point we are looking at a 25 year old processor manufacturing company. Whatever trivial optimizations they could make to their GPUs have already been made in my opinion.

In-spite of all of this, these people are selling about 1.68 million H100 equivalents every quarter? And not only that, the next quarter's guidance is about 13% higher than this quarter! And people have priced that into the stock price already. Their PE is about 50! Their stock holders are willing to pay 50 times the annual profit the company makes. And if the company doesn't make that much profit, i.e. sell about roughly 1.9 million H100s next quarter or whatever is the latest high performance GPU, their stock will crash.

I think the biggest bubble in the market right now is Nvidia. People have milked the Nvidia cow to the maximum limit.",90,136,2025-08-29 19:30:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3gv4a/i_want_to_talk_about_nvidia_stocks_a_little_bit/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854860

1n3dv7e,stocks,Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia‚Äôs H20 in China,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",370,149,2025-08-29 17:35:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3dv7e/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,2025-09-25 02:30:01.854868

1n3678c,stocks,I May Have Been Wrong About Enovix,"I was an early investor in Enovix that had soured on the stock with the idea that slow adoption has doomed this upstart battery manufacturer. Yesterday, Polaris Battery Lab released the results of their independent testing of the Enovix AI-1 battery. The results are stunning; Not only does it exceed expectations for charge time and cycle life, it achieves 919 Wh/L volumetric energy density, which is among the highest ever reported for a smartphone battery. It caused me to take a second look at what this company brings to the table. It brought me to realize that the investment case for Enovix isn't just about a better lithium-ion battery today; it's about a company well-positioned to compete in the next generation of battery technology. The most compelling aspect of Enovix isn't their current chemistry, but rather their manufacturing expertise and proprietary architecture.

**The Bear Case**

* **Long Time to Market:**¬†Enovix has been in development for a long time, and delays have created doubt about their ability to scale manufacturing. The company must prove it can execute its manufacturing ramp-up and achieve a cost structure that makes its high-performance batteries appealing to a wider market, before competitive progression obsoletes their advantages.
* **Erosive AI Effect:**¬†AI promises to significantly accelerate the discovery of new battery chemistries by replacing the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of trial and error with rapid, data-driven computational analysis. It does this primarily by sifting through millions of potential material combinations, predicting their properties, and pinpointing the most promising candidates for physical testing. This has an erosive effect on all patent portfolios but is especially caustic to pre-revenue upstarts that are attempting to introduce disruptive technologies. Again, it begs the question of whether they can beat the clock and achieve an early mover advantage.
* **Cost and Commercial Adoption:**¬†The lack of widespread commercial adoption to date, particularly with major smartphone and consumer electronics OEMs, raises questions about their manufacturing costs and whether they can compete on price. Without publicly available cost data, it's difficult to verify their competitiveness.

**The Bull Case**

* **Architectural Synergy with ASSBs**: The stacked geometry and Integrated Constraint System that Enovix uses today are not just features, they are solutions to problems that plague ASSBs. Solid-state batteries often require high pressure to ensure good contact between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes. Enovix has already solved this engineering challenge with its patented constraint system, which provides the necessary stack pressure to handle electrode expansion.
* **Safety and Thermal Management**: ASSBs are not immune to thermal runaway, especially under physical stress. Enovix's BrakeFlow‚Ñ¢ technology is an in-cell safety feature that could provide a critical redundancy for future ASSBs, which may still face internal short-circuit risks. This is a valuable piece of intellectual property that could be licensed or integrated into future solid-state designs.
* **A ""Placeholder"" Strategy**: Enovix management touts that they are chemistry agnostic. This phrasing allows the marketplace to¬†*eventually*¬†understand their message without revealing their competitive game plan. Enovix's current lithium-ion chemistry is just a placeholder. The company has accumulated a massive amount of expertise (and patent portfolio) focused on the manufacture and physical architecture of the battery rather than a specific chemical recipe. Enovix isn't just a silicon-anode company; it's an advanced battery company, that has long been secretly positioning itself for a seamless transition to new materials, like solid-state electrolytes, when they become commercially viable.

**The AI Revolution: A Catalyst for Enovix**

While AI may pose the aforementioned threats to Enovix, the AI revolution is proving to be a crucial and timely addition to the bull case. The demands of on-device AI are pushing battery power consumption to new heights. The AI-1 battery is positioned to be a first-mover in this segment, offering a substantial increase in energy density and power output. Enovix has given enough cost information to extrapolate an approximate unit cost of around $10. If Enovix can command a premium for this performance, it could generate the revenue needed to fund expansion and find themselves coincidentally (by design) in the right place at the right time. I believe Enovix is the sleeper that could become a major player in both today's and tomorrow's battery markets.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.
