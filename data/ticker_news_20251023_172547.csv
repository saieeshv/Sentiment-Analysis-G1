In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

“Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.”",Financial Post,2025-10-22T09:07:46Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/tesla-stops-growing-so-investors-pivot-to-dreams-of-an-ai-future,0.6,2025-10-23 17:18:53.225167,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:18:55.509109,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:19:31.812828,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

AAPL,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:19:38.560526,0.9999999999999999,

""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

AAPL,Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand: Analysis,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

AAPL,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

AAPL,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:19:52.017911,0.7,

AAPL,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

AAPL,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:19:49.829267,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

“Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.”",Financial Post,2025-10-22T09:07:46Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/tesla-stops-growing-so-investors-pivot-to-dreams-of-an-ai-future,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:06.236128,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:06.236485,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:06.592437,0.9999999999999999,

JPM,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

JPM,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:06.601159,0.9999999999999999,

JPM,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

JPM,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:06.602889,0.7,

JPM,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

Which is your favorite premium travel credit card? Tell us in the comments section.

JPM,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:20:06.602758,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

UNH,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

UNH,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:10.851935,0.9999999999999999,
UNH,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

UNH,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

UNH,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

UNH,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

Live Events

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

UNH,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

UNH,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:10.855017,0.7,

UNH,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

UNH,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:20:10.854713,0.9999999999999999,
UNH,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

“Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.”",Financial Post,2025-10-22T09:07:46Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/tesla-stops-growing-so-investors-pivot-to-dreams-of-an-ai-future,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:13.205546,0.9999999999999999,
AMZN,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:13.206035,0.9999999999999999,
AMZN,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:14.494850,0.9999999999999999,

AMZN,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

AMZN,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

AMZN,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

AMZN,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:14.496850,0.7,

AMZN,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

Which is your favorite premium travel credit card? Tell us in the comments section.

AMZN,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:20:14.496611,0.9999999999999999,
AMZN,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

WMT,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:16.277334,0.9999999999999999,
WMT,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:27.438799,0.9999999999999999,

WMT,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660.

Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

WMT,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:27.439833,0.9999999999999999,

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:20:27.442981,0.7,

WMT,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships.

Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

WMT,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:20:27.442594,0.9999999999999999,
WMT,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

T,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.8999999999999999,2025-10-23 17:20:32.152483,0.9999999999999999,
T,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.8999999999999999,2025-10-23 17:20:50.276476,0.9999999999999999,
T,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.8999999999999999,2025-10-23 17:20:50.568808,0.9999999999999999,

In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

T,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

T,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

T,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

Live Events

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

T,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers.

T,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-23 17:20:50.281989,0.7,

T,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

T,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:20:50.281413,0.9999999999999999,
T,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

Everything goes up in price these days, but about a million AT&T subscribers will have the opportunity to rejoice, as no price hike is intended to slam their plans.

Starting December 1, the carrier will charge their home broadband customers $5 more for the service. However, those who are using fixed wireless subscribers won't see an increase. The $5 price hike is meant to tackle higher operating costs as AT&T continues expanding its internet business.

Keeping the service quality up

AT&T confirmed that its upcoming $5 monthly price increase for home broadband will not affect fixed wireless customers. The clarification came after reports that the company had begun notifying broadband users of the change. Fixed wireless subscribers, who number around 1 million compared to almost 10 million on fiber, are exempt from the new rates.

The company explained that the rate adjustment is necessary to keep up with rising operational expenses and maintain service quality. Those who joined within the past year or participate in AT&T's $30 low-income plan will also be spared from the increase.

Fixed wireless broadband has become a growing alternative to cable internet, largely because it's more affordable and easier to deploy. AT&T's fixed wireless plans start at $60 with paperless billing and can drop to $47 when bundled with mobile service.

AT&T's fixed wireless offering, launched in August 2023, initially aimed to retain customers as the company phased out old copper lines. However, the service has grown faster than expected. AT&T added a record 203,000 fixed wireless subscribers in the second quarter of 2025, with analysts predicting a stronger third quarter showing around 230,000 new customers.

AT&T rivals push the fixed wireless service as well

Rivals Verizon and T-Mobile have been more aggressive in pushing fixed wireless, counting 5.1 million and 7.3 million subscribers, respectively. The technology's growth has forced cable companies like Comcast and Charter to defend their market share with price locks and bundled mobile offers. Comcast's five-year price lock plan, for instance, starts at $55 per month for 400 Mbps download speeds.

AT&T continues to invest heavily in network capacity. It's currently acquiring $23 billion worth of spectrum from EchoStar, which analysts estimate could support about 900,000 additional fixed wireless subscribers. In total, this expansion could give AT&T the spectrum capacity to serve roughly 6.3 million users.

Fixed wireless is of great importance for AT&T

AT&T's choice to leave fixed wireless customers out of its broadband price hike shows just how important that service has become to the company's future. With more people looking for cheaper, easier options than cable, fixed wireless has turned into a major focus not just for AT&T, but for the whole industry.

All eyes are now on AT&T's earnings report coming out Wednesday. It'll show whether the company's big bet on fixed wireless is actually working.

Will price hikes cease to hit users in 2026?

T,"Oli inspects burnt Balkot home, accuses Karki govt of shielding perpetrators","KATHMANDU: CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday visited his house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, that was set ablaze during the Gen-Z protests on September 9, and sharply criticised the Sushila Karki-led government, accusing it of protecting those responsible.

Accompanied by his wife Radika Shakya, Oli inspected the damaged property and expressed anger over what he called the burning of public assets “in the name of the government.” He alleged that the administration was reluctant to act against the perpetrators and accused Home Minister Om Prakash Aryal of seeking to shield suspects.

“This government has refused to punish the criminals. Even those arrested with evidence have been ordered released by the home minister,” Oli said, alleging the minister’s recent public remarks revealed the government’s intent to protect those involved in arson, looting and vandalism.

Oli also suggested that actions taken in the name of the government have been used to target rivals. “Those who have suffered or been targeted during the protests are now being pursued with political hostility by the government,” he claimed, adding that he believed he himself was being singled out for reprisals.

Speaking about the two Balkot houses that were damaged, Oli said the properties were not private holdings. He told reporters that his wife, Radika Shakya, had built the houses using earnings from her 33-year service at Nepal Rastra Bank, and that the couple had already completed the legal steps to transfer the properties, which were never intended as private assets, to public use after their lifetime. He insisted that those responsible for the damage must be punished, calling the destruction a loss to the state.

Oli warned that the UML would not be cowed by what he described as the government’s intimidation tactics. “The UML remains the only party alive now; it will uphold peace, order and good governance and will not be intimidated by the sudden threats and bluster of this government,” he said.

The former prime minister further alleged receiving information that the government was planning additional actions against him, but vowed not to be frightened. He urged authorities to take firm action against those who damaged public and private property during the unrest.",Khabarhub.com,2025-10-22T07:49:40Z,https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/502453/,0.4,2025-10-23 17:20:50.282797,0.7,

BA,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.8999999999999999,2025-10-23 17:21:01.062318,0.9999999999999999,

In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

“Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.”",Financial Post,2025-10-22T09:07:46Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/tesla-stops-growing-so-investors-pivot-to-dreams-of-an-ai-future,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:00.683349,0.9999999999999999,
BA,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:00.684122,0.9999999999999999,
BA,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:01.066219,0.9999999999999999,

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

BA,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

BA,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

BA,Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand: Analysis,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:00Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/labubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-analysis-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:01.064043,0.9999999999999999,
BA,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

BA,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:01.066605,0.7,

BA,"Oli inspects burnt Balkot home, accuses Karki govt of shielding perpetrators","KATHMANDU: CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday visited his house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, that was set ablaze during the Gen-Z protests on September 9, and sharply criticised the Sushila Karki-led government, accusing it of protecting those responsible.

Accompanied by his wife Radika Shakya, Oli inspected the damaged property and expressed anger over what he called the burning of public assets “in the name of the government.” He alleged that the administration was reluctant to act against the perpetrators and accused Home Minister Om Prakash Aryal of seeking to shield suspects.

“This government has refused to punish the criminals. Even those arrested with evidence have been ordered released by the home minister,” Oli said, alleging the minister’s recent public remarks revealed the government’s intent to protect those involved in arson, looting and vandalism.

Oli also suggested that actions taken in the name of the government have been used to target rivals. “Those who have suffered or been targeted during the protests are now being pursued with political hostility by the government,” he claimed, adding that he believed he himself was being singled out for reprisals.

Speaking about the two Balkot houses that were damaged, Oli said the properties were not private holdings. He told reporters that his wife, Radika Shakya, had built the houses using earnings from her 33-year service at Nepal Rastra Bank, and that the couple had already completed the legal steps to transfer the properties, which were never intended as private assets, to public use after their lifetime. He insisted that those responsible for the damage must be punished, calling the destruction a loss to the state.

Oli warned that the UML would not be cowed by what he described as the government’s intimidation tactics. “The UML remains the only party alive now; it will uphold peace, order and good governance and will not be intimidated by the sudden threats and bluster of this government,” he said.

The former prime minister further alleged receiving information that the government was planning additional actions against him, but vowed not to be frightened. He urged authorities to take firm action against those who damaged public and private property during the unrest.",Khabarhub.com,2025-10-22T07:49:40Z,https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/22/502453/,0.4,2025-10-23 17:21:01.067434,0.7,

BA,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships.

Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

BA,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

“Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterize it.”",Financial Post,2025-10-22T09:07:46Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/tesla-stops-growing-so-investors-pivot-to-dreams-of-an-ai-future,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:17.719936,0.9999999999999999,
XOM,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

XOM,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:20.076899,0.9999999999999999,
XOM,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

XOM,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

XOM,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:20.077685,0.9999999999999999,

XOM,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

XOM,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:20.081251,0.7,

XOM,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

XOM,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:21:20.080840,0.9999999999999999,
XOM,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

Article content

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

LIN,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:26.199995,0.9999999999999999,
LIN,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:26.628980,0.9999999999999999,

LIN,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

LIN,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

LIN,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

LIN,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:26.631965,0.7,

LIN,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

LIN,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:21:26.631604,0.9999999999999999,

NEE,"HUL Q2 Preview: Profit may fall 5% YoY as GST transition, weak demand to hit earnings","Synopsis

Hindustan Unilever is expected to post muted Q2 results, with just 1% revenue growth and a 5% profit decline as GST cuts, extended monsoon, and weak demand hit volumes and margins, though recovery is likely ahead.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) is expected to deliver a muted September-quarter performance as the recent GST rate cuts and extended monsoon disrupted sales momentum, even as weak underlying demand and channel destocking weighed on volumes. According to an average of six brokerages, HUL’s sales are likely to inch up just 1% year-on-year, while profit may decline 5% YoY, reflecting margin compression, lower other income, and temporary supply chain issues.

Analysts said the near-term weakness is largely transitory, with the company likely to recover in the coming quarters once the GST impact normalises.

GST disruption drags growth

Brokerages expect nearly 40% of HUL’s product portfolio—including soaps, shampoos, detergents, toothpaste, and packaged foods—to have been impacted by the GST transition from 18% to 5%, leading to short-term channel de-stocking and inventory realignment.

Kotak Equities said HUL’s business is expected to be near-flat to low single-digit, with de-stocking across multiple product categories impacting overall revenue growth. ""We build in 0.5% underlying volume and sales growth due to the transitory impact of the GST rate cut,"" the brokerage noted, estimating a 7.6% drop in PAT due to lower other income and weaker operating leverage.

Live Events

Nuvama also flagged temporary disruptions due to the GST shift, estimating flat underlying volumes and a 1% revenue growth for Q2FY26. The brokerage expects EBITDA to decline 5% YoY as gross margins drop 159 basis points to around 50%, driven by lower prices passed on to consumers.

Margin pressures persist

Margins are likely to remain under pressure as HUL adjusts pricing and spends more on promotions to clear older inventory. Kotak expects EBITDA margin to fall by 140 bps YoY to 22.1%, while Nuvama pegs it at 22.4%, consistent with the company’s guidance range of 22–23%.

Raw material trends remain mixed -- palm oil and crude-based inputs have shown volatility, while tea prices have softened and coffee remains near 52-week highs. ""Lower input costs in select categories will be partly offset by higher brand investments,"" said JM Financial, adding that extended rains impacted skin care and seasonal products.

Weak demand, but recovery ahead

Overall demand trends remain weaker than the previous quarter. Nuvama said categories like skin creams and sunscreens saw slower sales due to the delayed monsoon, while tea, salt, and health food drinks could see modest gains. Motilal Oswal expects 2% revenue growth led by 2.5% volume expansion, but sees 90 bps fall in gross margins as competitive intensity rises.

HSBC said the GST-led disruptions and trade incentives would limit near-term realizations, but maintained a stable margin outlook of around 22%. It expects EBITDA at Rs 3,450 crore, down 6% YoY, and a 6% decline in PAT.

Despite a weak Q2, analysts remain positive on HUL’s medium-term prospects, citing structural demand recovery, softer input costs, and the GST-driven price rationalization that could boost affordability in the coming quarters.

""The fiscal and monetary environment remains supportive, and HUL’s pricing power and portfolio strength position it well for a recovery in FY26,"" Nuvama said.

NEE,Tesla Stops Growing So Investors Pivot to Dreams of an AI Future,"Article content

In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

NEE,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:29.295460,0.9999999999999999,
NEE,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:31.338843,0.9999999999999999,

NEE,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

NEE,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

NEE,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:31.342402,0.7,

NEE,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

NEE,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:21:31.342027,0.9999999999999999,
NEE,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

PLD,"HUL Q2 Preview: Profit may fall 5% YoY as GST transition, weak demand to hit earnings","Synopsis

Hindustan Unilever is expected to post muted Q2 results, with just 1% revenue growth and a 5% profit decline as GST cuts, extended monsoon, and weak demand hit volumes and margins, though recovery is likely ahead.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) is expected to deliver a muted September-quarter performance as the recent GST rate cuts and extended monsoon disrupted sales momentum, even as weak underlying demand and channel destocking weighed on volumes. According to an average of six brokerages, HUL’s sales are likely to inch up just 1% year-on-year, while profit may decline 5% YoY, reflecting margin compression, lower other income, and temporary supply chain issues.

Analysts said the near-term weakness is largely transitory, with the company likely to recover in the coming quarters once the GST impact normalises.

GST disruption drags growth

Brokerages expect nearly 40% of HUL’s product portfolio—including soaps, shampoos, detergents, toothpaste, and packaged foods—to have been impacted by the GST transition from 18% to 5%, leading to short-term channel de-stocking and inventory realignment.

Kotak Equities said HUL’s business is expected to be near-flat to low single-digit, with de-stocking across multiple product categories impacting overall revenue growth. ""We build in 0.5% underlying volume and sales growth due to the transitory impact of the GST rate cut,"" the brokerage noted, estimating a 7.6% drop in PAT due to lower other income and weaker operating leverage.

Live Events

Nuvama also flagged temporary disruptions due to the GST shift, estimating flat underlying volumes and a 1% revenue growth for Q2FY26. The brokerage expects EBITDA to decline 5% YoY as gross margins drop 159 basis points to around 50%, driven by lower prices passed on to consumers.

Margin pressures persist

Margins are likely to remain under pressure as HUL adjusts pricing and spends more on promotions to clear older inventory. Kotak expects EBITDA margin to fall by 140 bps YoY to 22.1%, while Nuvama pegs it at 22.4%, consistent with the company’s guidance range of 22–23%.

Raw material trends remain mixed -- palm oil and crude-based inputs have shown volatility, while tea prices have softened and coffee remains near 52-week highs. ""Lower input costs in select categories will be partly offset by higher brand investments,"" said JM Financial, adding that extended rains impacted skin care and seasonal products.

Weak demand, but recovery ahead

Overall demand trends remain weaker than the previous quarter. Nuvama said categories like skin creams and sunscreens saw slower sales due to the delayed monsoon, while tea, salt, and health food drinks could see modest gains. Motilal Oswal expects 2% revenue growth led by 2.5% volume expansion, but sees 90 bps fall in gross margins as competitive intensity rises.

HSBC said the GST-led disruptions and trade incentives would limit near-term realizations, but maintained a stable margin outlook of around 22%. It expects EBITDA at Rs 3,450 crore, down 6% YoY, and a 6% decline in PAT.

Despite a weak Q2, analysts remain positive on HUL’s medium-term prospects, citing structural demand recovery, softer input costs, and the GST-driven price rationalization that could boost affordability in the coming quarters.

""The fiscal and monetary environment remains supportive, and HUL’s pricing power and portfolio strength position it well for a recovery in FY26,"" Nuvama said.

In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla Inc. stands out — but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker is expected to post a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings Wednesday afternoon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years.

What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock fell as much as 3.1 per cent Wednesday ahead of the results due after the market close.

“The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group.

This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less than 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Boeing Co.

The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times.

Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a US$7,500 tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September.

After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That would be below consensus estimates of about 448,000. The company delivered about 497,000 units in the third quarter.

PLD,Coca-Cola HBC agrees to acquire Coca-Cola Beverages Africa,"Coca-Cola HBC has agreed to acquire a 75% shareholding in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6bn, valuing the African bottler at US$3.4bn.

The transaction would create the world’s second-largest Coca-Cola bottling partner by volume and materially expand Coca-Cola HBC’s footprint across high-growth African beverage markets.

The company targets completion by the end of 2026, subject to approvals. As part of the Coca-Cola HBC acquisition, Gutsche Family Investments (GFI) will receive new Coca-Cola HBC shares equal to 5.47% of the enlarged share capital, and a bridge facility will fund the cash element.

An option agreement gives Coca-Cola HBC the right to buy, or The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) the right to sell, the remaining 25% of CCBA after completion.

Scale and market reach across Africa and Europe

CCBA operates in 14 African markets and accounts for about 40% of Coca-Cola system volumes on the continent.

Following completion, Coca-Cola HBC estimates it would represent roughly two-thirds of Africa’s Coca-Cola system volume and cover more than half of the continent’s population.

On a pro forma basis for 2024, the combined group would have produced 4.0bn unit cases, with revenues of €14.1bn and EBIT of €1.4bn.

The enlarged bottler would have leading positions across Africa and Europe, reinforcing its stated ambition to be a “24/7 beverage partner” in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) categories.

Strategic rationale and growth outlook

Management highlights demographic and macroeconomic drivers behind the CCBA deal, including fast-growing populations and a large under-30 consumer base in CCBA’s territories.

Coca-Cola HBC expects the combination to increase diversification, deepen exposure to emerging markets and support per-capita consumption growth.

The company plans to apply its operating model, route-to-market capabilities and sustainability initiatives alongside CCBA’s existing portfolio of more than 40 global and local brands.

The acquisition is positioned as a natural extension of Coca-Cola HBC’s long-standing presence in Nigeria and its 2022 entry into Egypt, creating a broader platform to share best practices across African markets.

Financial impact, funding and shareholder measures

Coca-Cola HBC guides to low single-digit earnings per share accretion in the first full year after completion.

Leverage is expected toward the upper end of the medium-term target range of 1.5x–2.0x net debt to EBITDA, with no anticipated effect on the company’s investment-grade credit profile.

To prioritise the transaction, the existing share buyback programme has been cancelled with immediate effect.

Funding will include a new bridge financing facility, alongside the share consideration issued to GFI. The option agreement with TCCC provides a pathway to full ownership of CCBA over time, subject to future decisions and regulatory clearances.

Listing plans and regulatory timeline

To reflect its enlarged African presence and “Coca-Cola Beverages Africa” brand relevance, Coca-Cola HBC intends to pursue a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, signalling a long-term commitment to South Africa and the wider region.

The company targets closing by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and competition approvals in the relevant jurisdictions and customary closing conditions.

Until completion, both companies will operate independently.",Packaging-gateway.com,2025-10-22T09:04:13Z,https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/coca-cola-hbc-agrees-to-acquire-coca-cola-beverages-africa/,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:33.490075,0.9999999999999999,
PLD,Intel Corporation Q3 2025 Preview: Can the Comeback Keep Its Momentum?,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reports third-quarter 2025 earnings after market close on October 23. Analysts expect EPS of $0.01, from a loss of $0.46 YoY, and revenue to stay flat at $13.2 billion. Despite limited top-line growth, the stock has climbed about 88% YTD. Much of the positive sentiment reflects strategic partnerships and capital inflows, U.S. government backing, a multi-billion-dollar investment from Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a renewed focus on Intel's foundry ambitions.

Investors want proof that Intel's long-promised turnaround is actually gaining ground. The company has spent the past few years trying to regain its manufacturing edge and convince the market it can run a competitive foundry business alongside TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung. Reports that Microsoft has picked Intel to produce its next-generation Maia 2 AI processor on the 18A node, suggesting early traction, but execution and yield improvement remain key to building trust in the foundry model. Beyond that, the focus remains on Intel's Client Computing and Data Center divisions. Both need to show that share losses to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia are at least slowing. Investors are looking for evidence that Intel's new chips are getting traction in AI-heavy servers and PCs, without further margin erosion.

Intel's strategic partnership with Nvidia, involving a multi-billion-dollar partnership to develop AI infrastructure and next-generation computing products, has further fueled investor enthusiasm. Still, this turnaround remains costly. Intel is still spending heavily on new fabs and research at a time when its profitability remains fragile. That's why management's comments on cost control, capital spending, and the timing for positive free cash flow will likely carry significant weight this quarter.

After such a strong rally, the market will need more than optimism to keep the momentum going. If Intel can demonstrate real progress in its foundry ramp, product execution, and cost discipline, its comeback narrative could start to look justified.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-22T08:29:27Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-q3-2025-preview-082927042.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:21:37.793739,0.9999999999999999,

PLD,Diwali 2025: Top Nifty stocks offering upside of up to 28% to bet on this Samvat 2082,"As the festive season draws to a close, leading brokerages have highlighted a select set of Nifty stocks with strong growth potential and robust fundamentals. These companies, spanning banking, energy, healthcare, automotive, defence, and consumer segments, come with buy recommendations and attractive target prices. These picks reflect the analysts’ confidence in sustainable earnings, strategic expansion, and long-term value creation. Here’s the full list!

ICICI Securities has picked the stock as one of its top bets with a target price of Rs 1,150 (14% upside). The brokerage highlights the bank’s consistent growth and strong operational performance across economic cycles. Following its merger, HDFC Bank has become the country’s second-largest lender with a well-diversified portfolio. In the initial post-merger phase, the bank focused on balance sheet consolidation and strengthened its deposit base, bringing the credit-deposit ratio down from around 105% to 86–88%.

SBI Securities gives a target price of Rs 8,675 (8.2% upside). As of June 2025, Apollo owned 73 hospitals with over 8,000 operational census beds. The company is on track to commission 1,937 new beds during FY26, which are expected to contribute around Rs 1,000 crore to FY27 revenue. Over the next 3–4 years, Apollo aims to add 2,435 beds (excluding FY26 additions) with a capital outlay of approximately Rs 4,438 crore, primarily funded through internal accruals, taking total operational census beds to 11,602.

Axis Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,500 (14% upside). The brokerage expects healthy growth momentum, with advances growing 1.5–2x nominal GDP. With asset quality challenges in the unsecured portfolio largely behind, Kotak plans to resume growth in personal loans, credit cards, and MFI segments, keeping MFI exposure capped at 3–4% while scaling unsecured loans to around 15% of the portfolio. The mid-market segment is another focus area. In its Q2 provisional update, the bank reported 16% YoY and 4% QoQ growth, and is expected to deliver ~17% CAGR credit growth over FY25–28E.

Motilal Oswal gives a target price of Rs 4,091 per share (13% upside). M&M plans to launch seven ICE SUVs, five BEVs, and five LCVs by 2030, starting from CY26, strengthening its presence across ICE and EV segments. Earnings growth is expected to be driven by rural recovery, robust product launches, improved tractor margins, and immediate GST rate pass-through to consumers.

Motilal Oswal has assigned a target price of Rs 1,000 (10% upside), citing structural tailwinds from government reforms such as GST 2.0, income tax reforms, and RBI liquidity infusion. These are expected to drive strong credit growth and support profitability across the BFSI sector. SBI benefits from diversified growth across retail, SME, and corporate segments, backed by a strong credit pipeline and digital initiatives.

Motilal Oswal has given a target price of Rs 490 (17% upside). The Indian Army’s Rs 30,000 crore tender for the ‘Anant Shastra’ project, with BEL as the lead integrator, boosts its order book beyond Rs 1 lakh crore and underscores its leadership in strategic defence programmes. Positioned under the TPCR 2025 roadmap, BEL is expected to benefit from sustained opportunities across the Army, Navy, and Air Force, offering strong long-term growth visibility.

Kotak Institutional Equities has assigned a target price of Rs 375 (11% upside). In the food delivery segment, Blinkit held a gross merchandise value share of 57% in FY25 versus Swiggy’s 43%, with presence in 750 cities compared to Swiggy’s 660. The brokerage expects Blinkit’s take rate to expand, with older stores driving operating leverage and EBITDA breakeven achievable in H2FY26. Consolidated revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 83% over FY25–28E.

Prabhudas Lilladher has set a target price of Rs 530 (28% upside), expecting margin recovery post Q2FY26. Leaf tobacco prices have softened 10–15%, wood prices are likely to decline, and integration of Century Paper acquisition will support margins. FMCG margins are expected to improve ~50 bps sequentially post-GST cut. Implementation of GST 2.0 on cigarettes with flat taxation and revival of profit growth post Q3FY26 is expected to re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 19.8x FY28 PE with a 4% dividend yield.

HDFC Securities has set a target price of Rs 2,244 (10% upside). The brokerage expects potential tariff hikes in H2FY26 to drive ARPU expansion toward the company’s medium-term goal of Rs 300, supporting stronger EBITDA margins and free cash flow generation for future investments. Airtel also deepened its strategic partnerships across key growth areas, including Hughes (satellite broadband JV), Lavelle (SD-WAN), Aquiliz (blockchain), Oracle (data centres), Apple (entertainment), and Google (equity and digital collaboration). The company is eyeing a Rs 40,000–50,000 crore opportunity across CPaaS, data centres, and cybersecurity segments.

HDFC Securities has assigned a target price of Rs 4,243 (9.2% upside). The company’s consolidated order pipeline for the remainder of FY26 stands at around Rs 14.8 lakh crore, including an infrastructure segment pipeline of Rs 8 lakh crore. Major projects span energy, infrastructure, heavy civil, renewables, water, defence, and international hydrocarbons. Management expects 10% growth in order intake and 15% revenue growth for FY26, reflecting strong execution potential. The order book remains robust at Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of June 2025, with 54% sourced from domestic markets and 46% from international markets.

PLD,Analysis:Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

Resale demand may therefore not be the primary concern. Investors ""may also incorporate a higher risk premium for Pop Mart's earnings if revenue growth peaks in this year,"" he said.",CNA,2025-10-22T08:27:55Z,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/analysislabubu-resale-price-falls-may-be-more-about-supply-demand-5417486,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:37.794148,0.9999999999999999,

PLD,Labubu resale price falls may be more about supply than demand: Analysis,"SHANGHAI: Kasidit Teerawiboosin, 22, has ridden the wave of Labubu's success as a reseller in Thailand of toys from Pop Mart, but the days of easily making money flipping the toothy-grinned monsters are numbered.

""Prices in the Thai resale market are going down really, really, really fast,"" said Teerawiboosin, who has been buying Pop Mart toys and selling them on unopened since early 2024.

Labubu are part of Pop Mart's The Monsters series of toys which accounted for more than a third of first-half revenue, as sales soared thanks to the influence of celebrity fans such as Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-football star David Beckham.

That has led to a booming resale market, supporting prices of both the toys and Pop Mart stock. But resale prices worldwide have dropped since their summer peak, raising questions about the longevity of demand for the Chinese toymaker's cash cow.

Data from Chinese art toy resale platform Qiandao showed the price of Labubu character Luck, launched in April, peaked in June above 500 yuan (US$70) on the secondary market but is now around 108 yuan. Prices of other characters in the same series have fallen below those at official Pop Mart stores.

Investors have been quick to pin the fall in resale prices on cooling demand, with Pop Mart's share price down around 25 per cent since August highs, though analysts and the company itself have said that the issue is supply rather than demand.

The stock is still up 186 per cent year to date.

Pop Mart said it has increased supply of plush toys, including Labubu, by 10 times this year and that it produces around 30 million units a month.

""It's similar to concert tickets,"" said Sid Si, Pop Mart's executive director and co-COO, in response to Reuters' questions about Labubu's resale value. ""Fans often end up scrambling for overpriced resold concert tickets because venues can't simply add more seats to meet surging demand, but for Pop Mart, there's a crucial difference - we can proactively increase supply to ease demand pressure.""

A summer sales boom means it is almost impossible to buy a Labubu from a Pop Mart store. Falling resale prices, then, could ""potentially"" indicate satisfied demand but also more supply, considering resellers likely made up a significant portion of first market sales, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang.

PLD,"Ladakh’s eco-tourism, traditional crafts get a lift from new GST reforms","Synopsis

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

The sweeping GST rationalisation reforms that took effect this Navratri have benefits for all walks of people in some form or the other.

The recent GST reduction across a wide variety of products and services will, similar to other states and UTs, also impact Ladakh's rich economy, bringing relief to artisans, farmers, and small enterprises.

Together, these reforms will support livelihood generation, cultural preservation, and the sustainable growth of Ladakh's economy.

A minimum 5 per cent GST on Pashmina, Namda rugs, and woodcrafts will help over 10,000 artisans.

Dairy and organic farming see better earnings and competitiveness through reduced GST; over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation to benefit from the GST reforms.

A reduced 5 per cent GST on hotel tariffs <=₹7,500 set to make travel more affordable and sustain the livelihood of over 25,000 people

GST cuts to support yak dairy, wool producers, and organic farming will also promote self-sustainability in Ladakh.

One of Ladakh's most valuable traditional crafts, Pashmina wool is produced in the Changthang region in Leh, sustaining over 10,000 nomadic herders. Pashmina is known for its warmth, softness, and fineness, and is used to make premium shawls, stoles, and garments.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to boost the competitiveness of authentic Ladakhi pashmina against imported or machine-made alternatives. This will also help improve income stability for local herders and artisans and increase the potential for export growth, according to the government.

Handwoven woollens and Namda rugs from Leh and Kargil represent Ladakh's rich tradition of wool craftsmanship, using yak and sheep wool to create dyed and distinctive textiles.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% helps lower production costs and encourages the revival of traditional handicraft practices.

""This is expected to provide significant benefits to local artisans and cooperatives engaged in wool processing and rug making,"" the government said in an article on Wednesday which has been posted on the Press Information Bureau website.

Wool felt products and woollen accessories from Leh and Changthang, such as felt boots, hats, and gloves, add to Ladakh's traditional craft culture. These items are used locally and are also popular purchases amongst tourists.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% provides support to small-scale, seasonal cottage industries engaged in wool processing and product making. It is also expected to strengthen Ladakh's economy with increased income for artisans.

Traditional Ladakhi carpentry from Leh and Kargil features intricately carved wooden altars, window frames, and furniture.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to make these handcrafted items more affordable and market-competitive. This will support traditional craftsmen, many from marginalised communities, encouraging the preservation of Ladakh's cultural and artistic heritage.

Ladakhi Thangka paintings, often crafted in the monasteries in Leh, Alchi, and Hemis, are traditional Buddhist scroll artworks used for meditation and decoration.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% makes these intricate paintings more accessible and economically viable, helping preserve a vital part of Ladakh's cultural heritage.

Local tourism and homestays across Leh, Nubra, Pangong, and Kargil support Ladakh's service economy, directly employing over 25,000 people.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% on hotel tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night makes travel and accommodation more affordable, particularly during the busy tourist season. This will support the growth of eco-tourism and the local homestay economy.

Ladakh is India's largest apricot producer, with Kargil, Leh, and the Nubra Valley serving as its main production hubs.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% benefits over 6,000 farming families engaged in apricot cultivation and processing. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of locally produced apricots and their value-added products, such as dried apricots, jams, and oils, making them more market-viable. It will enable better income opportunities and encourage growth in enterprises engaged in apricot production.

Sea buckthorn, cultivated across the Nubra Valley, Leh, and Changthang regions of Ladakh, is renowned for its medicinal and nutritional properties. Women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs) play a crucial role in harvesting and processing these berries.

The GST reduction from 12% to 5% is expected to enhance the competitiveness of locally made sea buckthorn products, making them more affordable and market-viable.

Yak cheese and milk products from Changthang and Nubra are traditional dairy items produced by Ladakh's nomadic communities. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% will support self-sustainability in remote, high-altitude areas, strengthening the local economy.

Leh berry, or buckthorn berry, from Leh and Nubra is used in producing a range of health drinks and supplements. The GST cut from 12% to 5% will encourage investment in local agro-processing, uplift small producers, and increase competitiveness.

In Sham Valley and Kargil, organic farming is gaining momentum, with farmers producing herbal teas, dried vegetables, etc. The GST reduction from 12% to 5% supports small-scale eco-farmers by lowering costs and improving profitability. This is expected to encourage wider adoption of sustainable farming practices while strengthening Ladakh's organic farming economy.

""The recent GST reforms mark a transformative step for Ladakh's economy by empowering its traditional artisans and farmers. From Pashmina weavers and apricot growers to sea buckthorn processors and homestay owners, each sector stands to gain through reduced costs, improved competitiveness, and higher incomes. Together, these reforms will preserve Ladakh's rich cultural heritage, strengthening its eco-friendly industries and making local products more affordable and marketable,"" the government concluded.

In a historic move to simplify the Goods and Services Tax(GST), GST Council in its 56th meeting had reduced the GST structure from four slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two main rates--5% (merit rate) and 18% (standard rate) along with a 40% special rate for sin/luxury goods.

These changes come into effect from September 22, 2025.

The changes were made to what the government termed the next-generation GST (Goods and Services Tax) rationalisation. It came on September 3, just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. This was aimed at reducing the tax burden on citizens while stimulating economic growth.

PLD,"Netflix co-CEOs play down interest in buying WBD’s studio, streaming assets","Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have played down, but not dismissed, rumours tying the streamer to a potential bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD)’s studio and streaming assets.

During the streamer’s third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the executives were asked to address industry chatter after WBD earlier in the day announced it was reviewing “strategic options” after receiving “unsolicited interest” from “multiple” parties about acquiring all or parts of the company.

“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. Nothing is a must-have for us to meet the goals we have for the business,” said Sarandos.

“But as we wrote in the [shareholder] letter, we focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A. And when it comes to M&A opportunities, we look at them – and we look at all of them – and we apply the same framework and lens.”

WBD’s announcement comes amid reports that Paramount is making an aggressive acquisition play. According to reports, the David Ellison-led company offered to acquire the entirety of WBD for around US$20 per share, and then improved that offer to US$24 per share, though both bids were rejected.

WBD is in the process of splitting into two companies, with one (Warner Bros) housing the studio and streaming assets including HBO, HBO Max, Warner Bros Television and Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, while the other (Discovery Global) will comprise the linear networks and several other assets, including Discovery+.

Paramount’s bid to acquire all of WBD would pre-empt its split into two, and potentially rule out streaming players like Netflix and Apple, which have repeatedly said they have no interest in owning legacy media assets.

Sarandos reiterated those sentiments during the earnings call, saying: “We’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there.” He did not, however, make mention of WBD’s studio and streaming assets, noting simply that “we believe we can be, and we will be, choosy.”

Peters added that mega-mergers, including Disney/Fox, Amazon/MGM, Time Warner/AT&T and Discovery/WarnerMedia, rarely have a transformative impact on the businesses involved. The prospect of a competitor scaling up through a merger is not a concern to Netflix, he said.

“None of those mergers [represented] a fundamental shift in the competitive landscape, and we have seen a wide range of outcomes from such mergers. So watching some of our competitors potentially get bigger via M&A does not change… our view on the competitive landscape,” he said.

It remains unclear who WBD was referring to when it said “multiple bidders,” though CNBC’s David Faber reported that Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties.

Sarandos and Peter’s comments came after Netflix reported its third-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 17% year-on-year to US$11.5bn.

Its quarterly revenue total was in line with analyst expectations, but operating income was below forecasts as a result of a US$619m expense related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities.

Operating income was still up by 12% year-on-year to US$3.2bn, but shares fell around 6.5% in after-hours trading. When excluding that expense, Netflix said it would have exceeded operating margin forecasts, adding that it does not expect the dispute to have a material impact on its future results.

By region, revenue in the US and Canada grew 17% to US$5.01bn, while Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 18% to US$3.7bn, Latin America climbed 10% to US$1.37bn and Asia Pacific rose 21% to US$1.37bn.

Netflix highlighted its growing share of viewership in the US and UK over the past three years. According to Nielsen data cited by the streamer, its share of TV time was 8.6% in Q3 2024, versus 7.5% in Q4 of 2022. In the UK, its share of TV viewership grew to 9.4% in the most recent quarter, according to Barb data, up from 7.7%.

On the series side, its most-watched titles in Q3 included season two of Wednesday (114 million views), season two of My Life with the Walter Boys (36 million), Japanese series Alice in Borderland (20 million) and the true crime docuseries Amy Bradley Is Missing (35 million). Netflix calculates a ‘view’ as the total hours viewed divided by the runtime of the title. Its top movies in Q3 included The Thursday Murder Club starring Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan (61 million) and My Oxford Year (81 million).

Netflix also streamed the Canelo vs. Crawford match, which it claimed is the “most-viewed” men’s championship boxing match this century with 41 million viewers.",C21media.net,2025-10-22T07:55:42Z,https://www.c21media.net/news/netflix-co-ceos-play-down-interest-in-buying-wbds-studio-streaming-assets/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:37.797177,0.7,

PLD,Why the Amex Platinum Card is no longer a premium travel credit card,"Disclosure: The Points Pundit receives NO compensation from credit card affiliate partnerships. Support the blog by applying for a card through my personal referral links. This article is meant for information purposes only and doesn’t constitute personal finance, health or investment advice. Please consult a licensed professional for advice pertaining to your situation.

Over the last month, I’ve covered the refresh of the Amex Platinum Card quite extensively. After the card was refreshed, the general perception was positive. However, if you look at some of the comments, you’ll see long time cardholders of the card complain about how the card has essentially become a coupon book and isn’t necessarily the ‘premium’ travel credit card they signed up for back in the day. Well, it seems like at least one person seems to agree with that analysis – Amex’s CEO.

Also Read: Wow! 500,000 requests in a month for the ‘mirror finish’ design on the Amex Platinum Card!

Amex Platinum Card – Key Target Market Shifts

During their most recent earnings call, Amex’s CEO Steve Squeri was pretty clear on who the target customer is for the Amex Platinum Card. If you look at the way Amex has repurposed their products over the last few years, especially post Covid-19, this comes as no surprise. The spend data confirms it.

Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen Z card members, with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts.

Will Amex launch an ultra premium card one level above the Amex Platinum Card?

This was the second time Amex refreshed the Amex Platinum Card in the last four years. As per Amex’s own numbers, it seems like their core demo is engaged with the card, with the focus moving from just premium travel to more of lifestyle, shopping, dining and entertainment.

With the value enhancements we’ve made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card that it is today, with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for its exceptional value and are highly engaged in the product. A good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021, coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we’ve added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness, and delivery services, in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs.

Don’t make this mistake with the Digital Entertainment Credit on the Amex Platinum Card

The last part of the statement clearly proves that Amex sees their younger cohorts more engaged and willing to pay an even higher annual fee, in lieu of lifestyle benefits that cater to their needs. This is again confirmed by the fact that the transaction volume of this group if 25% higher than their older cohorts.

The momentum we’ve seen from younger customers also continued. Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as Gen X. International had another strong quarter.

The Pundit’s Mantra

Many of us signed up for the Amex Platinum Card for the first time (I got it in 2014) when it was ‘the’ premium travel credit card in the market. However, this statement by Amex’s CEO clearly signifies the shift in focus from a premium travel focused much older target market to a much younger target market looking to enjoy ‘premium’ lifestyle perks.

In a nutshell, if you’re looking for something that’s laser focused on premium travel, then the Amex Platinum Card may still be an option. However, it definitely isn’t ‘the’ option to go for as it was for all these years.

PLD,"Is a corporate credit rebound around the corner? Yes, say banks taking early bets","While the uptick is largely driven by working capital financing, some capex-linked lending and project financing deals are also resurfacing in sectors such as infrastructure, renewables, and manufacturing, senior bankers said.

At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, which had earlier slowed its wholesale book as competitive loan pricing muted loan spreads, the tone has changed.

“...[investment in capex] is very modest... it is largely working capital financing (that) we have participated in (this quarter),"" chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said during the September quarter earnings call on 18 October.

For the quarter just gone by, HDFC Bank's corporate and other wholesale loan book grew 6.4% year on year and 4.7% on quarter, sharply higher than 1.7% on year growth and a 1.3% on quarter decline in the three months ended June.

This marks a turn for HDFC Bank, which had been recalibrating its balance sheet over the past few quarters following the merger with erstwhile parent HDFC Ltd.

Rival lender Axis Bank, too, pointed to renewed traction in wholesale lending, particularly in select sectors, showing early signs of investment revival.

The bank's stance has always been growth under favourable pricing, reiterated its executive director Subrat Mohanty.

""In Q2, there were a few good opportunities that came our way, something that we have not seen in the past... in general we find that there is opportunity in the wholesale segment for us based on strong relationships and some of trends that we are seeing in certain sectors such as movement from clients making new investments,"" he said.

Axis Bank's corporate loan book grew 20% on year and 11% on quarter at the end of September as against 9% on year and 6% on sequential rise in the prior quarter.

Rising bond yields

The pickup in corporate credit in the banking sector comes as yields on government securities maturing in 10 years rose 20 basis points (bps) to 6.5% in the September quarter over mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

In August, speciality chemicals maker Neogen Chemicals Ltd raised ₹200 crore on its A rated bonds maturing in December 2028 at a coupon of 10.5%.

Such rates in the bond market made bank loans more attractive for corporates, especially the low-rated ones.

The September quarter rise in yield was a reversal from the 25 bps fall since early February, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its interest rate easing cycle till June.

The weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans of scheduled commercial banks was at 8.75% in August (latest available), down from 8.81% a month earlier, RBI's monthly data showed, making it cheaper for corporates to borrow.

Bankers broadly agree that while capex-led demand remains modest, working capital financing and project-linked funding are driving incremental growth. Most also expect momentum to strengthen in the coming quarters as sanctioned loans move to disbursement stage and as investment activity gradually picks up.

""It's still a bit early. In Q2, you would have seen corporate credit growth because the yields were still high. And to that extent, bank credit actually picked up in Q2,"" said AM Karthik, senior vice president and co-group head, Icra, adding the ratings agency had not revised its credit growth estimates for FY26 yet.

The cuts in goods and services tax rates aimed at spurring domestic demand and to partly offset the tariff impact on the exports would support credit expansion for banks and NBFCs in the near term, Icra said in a statement on 19 September.

Sector-wide uptick

Public sector banks also joined the lending rebound, buoyed by a healthy project pipeline and improved corporate balance sheets. Punjab National Bank, for instance, has total loan sanctions worth ₹1.78 trillion, which are awaiting phased disbursements.

“We are expecting good corporate loan book growth in Q3 and Q4 because of these sanctions,"" said Ashok Chandra, chief executive at the bank.

Proposals are coming from infrastructure, road projects, renewable energy, and other sections of industrial borrowers, Chandra told investors on the Q2 earnings call. Its corporate loan book recorded a nearly 8% year on year growth in the September quarter as against 7% in the previous quarter.

Bank of India reported double-digit growth of nearly 12% on year in its corporate book in Q2, with a robust disbursement pipeline. This is double the 5.5% on year rise in Q1.

“Our total pipeline, including global and domestic corporate loans, stands at over ₹70,000 crore, about 10% of our global loan book,"" the bank's chief executive Rajneesh Karnatak said. Of this, about ₹50,000 crore pertains to corporate lending alone, making the bank confident of strong disbursals in the second half of this fsical.

Even smaller public sector banks are seeing renewed traction, though pricing remains a challenge. While demand exists, the borrowing cost expectations of corporates remain unrealistically low, Indian Overseas Bank chief executive Ajay Kumar Srivastava said.

""The issue is not demand; it’s pricing,"" Srivastava told Mint in an interview. “Most corporates seek loans at around 6%, which is not viable for us since our own funding costs are above that level.""

The bank, however, has a ₹15,000 crore sanctioned pipeline and expects 12-13% on year growth in its corporate loan book this year, led by manufacturing and PLI-linked sectors. PLI is short for performance-linked incentive schemes of the government of India, under which it encourages investment in domestic manufacturing with a mix of tax and other sops.",Livemint,2025-10-22T08:05:21Z,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/corporate-credit-demand-uptick-india-banks-rbi-11761106282535.html,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-23 17:21:37.796810,0.9999999999999999,
PLD,"Hit by unusual rains, Heineken's India volume declines in July-September","Synopsis

Heineken NV faced a notable challenge this September quarter with a mid-single-digit downturn in beer volumes sold in India, largely due to challenging weather conditions brought about by heavy monsoon rains. Nevertheless, the company celebrated a robust mid-single-digit rise in organic net revenue, thanks to effective pricing strategies in critical markets and an appealing product variety.

Dutch brewing major Heineken NV, which owns United Breweries Ltd (UBL), on Wednesday said its India beer volume saw a ""mid-single-digit"" decline in the September quarter on account of unusually heavy rains in parts of the country during monsoon.

However, its organic net revenue grew in ""mid-single-digit"", largely supported by price hikes in some of the key states, along with a portfolio mix.

""In India, organic net revenue (beia) grew by a mid-single-digit, while beer volume fell by a mid-single-digit, impacted by an unusually strong monsoon season. We outperformed the market. Price-mix expanded by a high single digit, supported by pricing in key states and portfolio mix,"" said Heineken in its earnings statement.

Its volume in the premium beer segment -- generally above Rs 125 per pint -- ""grew in the low teens"" led by Ultra Max from the portfolio of the home-grown brand Kingfisher and launch of Amstel Grande during the quarter.

In 2025, many states saw higher than normal rainfall in the first two monsoon months of July and August, which made the quarter tougher. Companies operating in the consumer space faced seasonal sales dips, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demands.

Live Events

In Heineken's Asia Pacific market zone, which includes India, the net revenue organically increased 5.6 per cent, but total consolidated volume was down 0.8 per cent.

Heineken's revenue in the September quarter was 8.7 billion euros, down 4 per cent.

Heineken reported a decline of beer volume organically by 4.3 per cent, with growth in Africa & Middle East more than offset by lower volume in Europe and the Americas.

""We are gaining or holding volume market share in a substantial majority of our markets, with notable gains in Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Ethiopia,"" it said.

Its premium beer volume decreased by 2.2 per cent as growth in Vietnam, India, Nigeria, and South Africa was more than offset by lower volumes in Brazil and the USA.

Its brand Amstel grew strongly in South Africa, India, Romania, Tunisia, and Ecuador, the earnings statement said.

The Dutch major owns over 61.5 per cent share in UBL, which is a leading player in the domestic market with brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black B Bullet, Maharaja Premium Indian Pilsner, and Taj Mahal Premium.

Besides, it also sells beer under brands such as Heineken, Amstel Bier, Sol, etc, from the portfolio of the Dutch brewing major.

AAPL,Apple (AAPL) Looks to iPhone Sales to Reignite Upgrade Supercycle,"Apple Inc. (AAPL), the smartphone powerhouse, is edging closer to a $4 trillion market valuation after its shares climbed 6% following an Oct. 20 report from Counterpoint Research. The report revealed that the iPhone 17 has outperformed its predecessor, the iPhone 16, during its first 10 days on the market. The bullish impetus has since cooled, with AAPL stock now trading around the $257 level.

The new model appears to have resolved several key technological issues that users had raised in recent years, reaffirming Apple’s reputation for innovation. The iPhone 17 lineup is also showing strong momentum in China—one of Apple’s most critical markets. Despite these encouraging trends, I remain Neutral on Apple stock, as I believe its current valuation already reflects the company’s underlying economic fundamentals.

iPhone 17 Gets Off to a Great Start

According to Counterpoint Research, Apple’s iPhone 17 series has achieved 14% higher sales than the iPhone 16 lineup during its first 10 days of availability in the U.S. and China—two of the company’s most critical markets. In China, the base iPhone 17 has emerged as the top seller, while in the U.S., strong demand for the iPhone 17 Pro Max has driven sales growth. Adding to the positive momentum, Apple’s eSIM-only model, the iPhone Air, recently received regulatory approval in China, with pre-orders beginning on October 17.

The iPhone 17’s robust early performance in China is particularly significant, given the company’s recent struggles. In Fiscal 2024, Apple reported an 8% year-over-year decline in China sales to $67 billion, followed by a further 4% drop in the first nine months of 2025.

The company has been losing ground to domestic competitors such as Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi (XIACF)—each gaining market share at Apple’s expense. From Q1 2024 to Q2 2025, Apple’s share of smartphone shipments fell by 100 basis points, while Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi gained 100, 300, and 200 basis points, respectively. The iPhone 17 series could help Apple reverse this trend and regain lost momentum in China during the current quarter.

Apple’s Pivot to Innovation is Promising

One of the main reasons I’m taking a neutral stance on Apple is the tech giant’s lackluster innovation pipeline. This lack of innovation was arguably one of the main reasons behind the company’s market share losses in China. According to Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong, Chinese consumers look for longer battery life, lighter designs, and AI-powered user experiences when they are purchasing a new smartphone.

Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI product suite, is not available in China due to regulatory barriers. Expectations are for these features to be rolled out in China later this year. However, even if these expectations come to fruition, there is no denying that Apple Intelligence significantly lags the AI experiences offered by local smartphone manufacturers such as Huawei. Apple has its work cut out to close this technological gap in the coming months to avoid losing further market share to local competitors.

What is encouraging, however, is Apple’s pivot to innovation with the release of the iPhone 17 series. Cameras have received a significant boost in the latest iPhone series, and the A19 chips used in new models are delivering a much better user experience. Additionally, the company has equipped the iPhone 17 series with “vapor chamber cooling” technology, which is expected to keep the device temperature in check even while using advanced AI features. Many users had previously complained of Apple iPhone devices heating uncontrollably while using advanced software features.

Apple’s renewed focus on innovation is a welcome sign for investors, as the company, without this focus, was expected to lose further market share in the all-important Mainland China market. Apple has also made an important decision to allow third-party app developers to access the core LLM that powers Apple Intelligence, which should enable them to add more AI features to their mobile applications.

What is the Target Price for AAPL?

On Wall Street, AAPL stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell ratings over the past three months. AAPL’s average stock price target of $261.68 implies approximately 2% upside potential over the next twelve months.

Wall Street analysts generally view Apple as fairly valued at current levels. While the iPhone 17 series has the potential to spark a major smartphone upgrade cycle—driven by its enhanced camera capabilities, lightweight design (notably the iPhone Air), and integrated AI features—I also consider Apple’s valuation to be complete at a forward P/E of 36x.

The company is currently trading at a premium compared to leading AI players such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG), which, in my view, limits the margin of safety for investors, especially since Apple remains several years behind its big-tech peers in fully leveraging artificial intelligence.

iPhone Momentum Insufficient to Extend Upside

The iPhone 17 series is showing strong early momentum in the U.S. and China—two of Apple’s most vital markets. The company’s renewed commitment to innovation is a positive development, especially after recent years when limited advancements, particularly in AI integration, led to market share losses in China.

However, despite these encouraging signs, I believe Apple’s stock remains fairly valued, as it continues to trade at a premium to major tech peers that have made more substantial progress in adopting AI. Accordingly, I maintain a neutral outlook on Apple’s prospects based on its current valuation.",Markets Insider,2025-10-23T06:37:40Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-aapl-looks-to-iphone-sales-to-reignite-upgrade-supercycle-1035417070,1.0,2025-10-23 17:21:49.400544,,0.192156862745098
AAPL,Apple Stock Soars -- Why It Can Go Higher | The Motley Fool,"Apple (AAPL 1.66%) shares have rallied sharply from lows earlier this year. Shares traded below $180 during the tariff scare in April, and the stock largely stayed below $210 through August. Recently, however, shares pushed to record territory above $260 as investors digested impressive fiscal third-quarter results and the well-received launch of the iPhone 17 line-up.

Ultimately, the Cupertino-based iPhone maker is benefiting from a healthier core business and a product cycle that finally looks like a tailwind again. For investors wondering whether to trim after the run-up, doing so could be a mistake.

Here are five reasons I'm bullish on Apple stock -- even after its recent run-up.

1. Recent results are moving in the right direction

Revenue in the quarter ended Jun. 28 (fiscal Q3) increased 10% year over year to about $94.0 billion. That compares with just 5% growth in the March quarter.

Even more, Apple's momentum in fiscal Q3 was in the areas investors watch closely. The period's iPhone sales rose about 13% to about $44.6 billion. Additionally, services revenue increased about 13% to a record $27.4 billion.

Apple also said every geographic segment grew in the June quarter. That was not the case earlier in the fiscal year.

2. Improving profitability

Earnings per share rose even faster than revenue during the quarter. The key per-share profitability metric rose 12% year over year to $1.57. Share count reduction helped, but the bigger driver was higher gross profit dollars from iPhone and services.

Total gross margin reached 46.5%, up slightly from a year ago. This was despite product margin facing tariff costs that pressured profitability. Meanwhile, Apple's services gross margin remained far higher than both Apple's product gross margin and its overall gross margin. This is important because Apple's services business generally grows faster than its products business, so the high-margin segment will likely have a growing impact on the company's overall profitability.

3. A cash cow

Apple closed the quarter with about $133 billion in cash and marketable securities and roughly $92 billion of term debt. That balance sheet, combined with the company's robust free cash flow (trailing-12-months free cash flow was $96.2 billion) gives the company flexibility to keep funding both investment and capital returns.

Indeed, the board authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program in May and lifted the quarterly dividend 4% to $0.26. In addition, the company has committed to investing $600 billion in jobs, manufacturing, supplier partnerships, and other expenditures in the U.S. -- investments that will likely help fuel Apple's future growth.

4. iPhone 17 strength

Recent research from research firm Counterpoint suggests that iPhone 17 demand is significantly ahead of last year's cycle in the U.S. and China. If this turns out to be true, Apple could maintain its recent return to double-digit growth in iPhone sales in the coming quarters.

Apple's new iPhone lineup has been well-received, making many analysts more optimistic about the stock. Not only is the entry-level iPhone 17 packed with value, but there are differentiating factors for the flagship iPhone 17 Pro lineup, too, including significant camera upgrades and a bold new orange color. And then there's an entirely new iPhone priced between these two: the iPhone Air. It sports an overhauled form factor that focuses on durability and thinness.

5. An attractive valuation

While shares aren't cheap, they're not expensive either. The stock trades at 32 times forward earnings. And combining both the quality of Apple's business with the fact that it is inflecting in recent quarters, it makes sense to pay up for a reasonable valuation.

A strong iPhone sales cycle and margin expansion as its high-margin services segment grows as a percent of overall revenue should help Apple live up to this multiple.

Of course, there are some key risks. Tariffs weighed on product margin in the June quarter, and management estimated about $1.1 billion of tariff costs in the current quarter. Additionally, while Apple's revenue in Greater China started recovering in fiscal Q3, it could weaken again. Given how dependent Apple is on the segment, investors need to watch iPhone sales in the market closely.

Overall, the stock looks good -- even at its higher valuation. Revenue growth accelerated from fiscal Q2 to fiscal Q3, and a strong iPhone 17 could help the company's revenue growth accelerate even more. In addition, Apple's fast-growing services segment is a key tailwind that should persist for years to come.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-23T08:46:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/23/apple-stock-soars-why-it-can-go-higher/,0.7,2025-10-23 17:21:41.125549,,0.1843137254901961
AAPL,Walmart Stock (WMT) Flattens as it Pulls the Plug on Thousands of Overseas H-1B Visas,"Shares in retail giant Walmart (WMT) were flat today as it emerged that it has stopped hiring people who require controversial H-1B visas.

Thoughtful Employer

As first reported by Bloomberg, Walmart has decided to pause job offers to candidates using H-1B visas, marking a major move for the retail sector and U.S. business in general. That’s because Walmart gave the green light to more than 2,000 H-1B visas in the first half of this year, more than any other retailer.

A Walmart spokesperson said it is “committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”

The H-1B allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to work in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. Jobs in fields such as mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical sciences often qualify.

However, concerned that replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign workers poses a threat to national security, President Trump signed an executive order last month imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B applicants.

That’s up from an average cost of between $4,535 and $17,885.

Tech Impact

It had been expected that the biggest impact of the changes would be on the U.S. tech sector. Amazon (AMZN) had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025, with rivals such as Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) securing more than 4,000 visas.

Business groups have objected to Trump’s decision, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently filing a lawsuit against the administration. It believes that the increased fee harms American businesses and forces them to either increase labor costs or lose access to skilled overseas talent.

Trump, whose tariff policy has the creation and protection of American jobs at its heart, believes the opposite. It is why political decisions are such a key risk for companies, including Walmart, and their investors.

For Walmart, which is increasingly diversifying its business away from bananas and back-to-school clothes to technology, it could potentially stymie some of those moves. That includes new AI shopping assistants and partnerships with major tech names such as OpenAI.

Is WMT a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On TipRanks, WMT has a Strong Buy consensus based on 29 Buy ratings. Its highest price target is $129. WMT stock’s consensus price target is $115.11. implying a 7.66% upside.

AAPL,The smartest ASX ETFs for beginner investors to buy,"Starting your investing journey can feel intimidating. With thousands of shares to choose from and endless opinions about where the market is headed, it is easy to feel stuck before you even begin.

That's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in.

They allow you to invest in hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of shares at once, giving you instant diversification and a stress-free way to build wealth over time.

If you're a beginner investor looking to start small and build a strong foundation, the three ASX ETFs listed below stand out right now. Here's why they could be smart picks:

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

If you want exposure to the world's best stocks, it is hard to look past the BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF. This fund tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the United States, which is home to some of the world's best-known brands.

Its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These are companies driving global technological change and long-term economic growth.

For beginners, this means that this ASX ETF offers a simple way to own a slice of the innovation shaping the future, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to e-commerce and digital advertising.

BetaShares Australian Quality ETF (ASX: AQLT)

While it is great to have global exposure, it is also smart to own a piece of Australia's strongest shares. The BetaShares Australian Quality ETF focuses on homegrown businesses with high returns on equity, low debt, and consistent earnings growth.

The fund's holdings include some of Australia's most respected names such as Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL), Pro Medicus Ltd (ASX: PME), Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG), and ResMed Inc. (ASX: RMD). These are companies that have built long-term competitive advantages and continue to generate solid profits year after year.

For new investors, the BetaShares Australian Quality ETF offers an easy way to own a basket of high-quality Australian shares without the need to pick individual winners. This provides a great foundation for the domestic portion of a beginner's portfolio.

BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF (ASX: ASIA)

Finally, the BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF could be a powerful way for beginners to tap into the growth story unfolding across Asia.

It invests in the region's biggest and most innovative tech companies, providing exposure to a market many Australian investors often overlook.

Its top holdings include Tencent Holdings (SEHK: 700), Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), and Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU).

These companies are shaping the future of digital life across Asia, from e-commerce and entertainment to cloud services and artificial intelligence. And with a rapidly growing middle class and rising technology adoption, the region is expected to remain one of the world's fastest-growing markets for years to come.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-23T07:18:55Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/23/the-smartest-asx-etfs-for-beginner-investors-to-buy/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:21:44.129371,,0.3254901960784313
AAPL,"Move Over, Magnificent 7: This 1 Rare Earth ETF Is Winning Over Wall Street Now","The fund currently holds 35 companies, with its top ten positions making up 49.19% of total assets. Among its leading names, Centrus Energy (LEU) (6.65%) represents the fund’s exposure to the growing nuclear energy and uranium segment. Core Natural Resources (CNR) (5.29%) and Coeur Mining (CDE) (5.27%) showcase its reach into mineral extraction and precious metals. Peabody Energy (BTU) (5.00%) strengthens the portfolio with its foothold in coal and energy transition materials, while Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) (4.91%) and Alcoa (AA) (4.70%) bring deep exposure to U.S. steel and aluminum output. The mix continues with Hecla Mining (HL) (4.58%), MP Materials (MP) (4.55%), Warrior Met Coal (HCC) (4.39%), and Steel Dynamics (STLD) (4.38%), all major contributors to America’s resurgent industrial engine.

The fund is valued at around $3.35 billion in assets, with its price at $100.32, a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 76.32%, and a 52‑week rise of 50.99% as of Oct. 20.

It maintains a modest annual dividend yield of 0.32% and a management fee of 0.35%, making it relatively cost-effective for its category. The ETF’s liquidity is also notable, with 3.46 million shares traded this month, up sharply from 1.97 million the month before. That’s a 76.07% increase, evidence that it has become a highly active fund amid renewed confidence in the metals space.

Domestic Metals Renaissance Supports XME’s Growth

One of the clearest catalysts supporting the rise of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF has been the impact of newly enacted U.S. tariffs on imported metals, which have reshaped the market’s supply dynamics and pricing power.

In the latest quarter, the U.S. expanded tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and finished metal products, aiming to safeguard domestic manufacturing and fortify key supply chains. These moves have pushed domestic prices higher, tightened global supply flows, and raised profitability expectations for U.S. producers, a dynamic that directly reinforces XME’s underlying index exposure.

That policy tailwind has coincided with a powerful lift in the broader metals complex. The industrial surge in silver, now trading around $52.24, marks its strongest level. Demand continues to scale with global renewable-energy buildouts, where silver’s use in solar panels and high-efficiency circuitry has made it almost indispensable.

Momentum doesn’t stop there. Gold’s recent run has earned the nickname “golden quarter,” rallying to roughly $4,124.30 per ounce. This strength stems from robust central bank accumulation and investors’ renewed appetite for stability amid an uncertain inflation path.

Conclusion

So, is XME really stepping into the spotlight the Magnificent 7 once owned? All signs suggest that it is. With tariffs pushing domestic metal prices higher, industrial demand for silver and copper holding firm, and gold and aluminum showing sustained strength, the fund’s rally seems rooted in real economic momentum, not speculation. Even if short-term pullbacks emerge, like today's 6.5% drop, the tone across the metals market remains visibly bullish. Unless demand cools sharply, XME’s trajectory still leans upward, a reminder that in 2025, hard assets are calling the market’s tune.",Yahoo!

AAPL,This Nvidia Supplier Is Beginning To Fizzle Out After Monumental Rally: Growth Score Nosedives - Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM),"One of Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) key manufacturing partners, responsible for producing much of the chipmaker's highly sought-after GPUs, is losing steam.

After fueling a multi-year rally, the supplier's momentum is now fading, reflected in a sharp drop in its Growth score within Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings.

TSM is gathering positive momentum. See what the experts say here.

A Steep Decline In The Growth Score

The Growth score in Benzinga’s Edge Rankings is calculated based on a company’s historic growth profile, that is, the pace at which earnings and revenues have grown, with equal importance given to both long-term and immediate trends, such as the latest quarterly earnings report.

The stock in question with the big drop in Growth scores is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), a pure-play foundry company that manufactures the vast majority of NVIDIA’s high-performance GPUs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.

The Taiwan-based company has seen its Growth score drop from 89.4 to 20.17 within the span of a week, hinting at a slowdown in the pace at which the company has grown in recent years.

Being one of the few global mega-cap companies that reports its revenues every month, TSMC’s September figures showed a 31.4% year-over-year growth in sales, driven by growing orders from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA.

However, the company also marked a 1.4% month-over-month decline in sales compared to August, which is what likely led to the decline in its Growth score in Benzinga’s Edge Rankings. Riding on the coattails of NVIDIA and the AI frenzy, the stock is up 227% over the past five years, with this momentum now beginning to fade.

The stock continues to score high on Momentum and Quality, but is now doing poorly in-terms of Growth in Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings. It, however, still has a favorable price trend in the short, medium and long terms. Click here for deeper insights on the stock, its peers and competitors.

JPM,Jim Cramer Discusses JPMorgan (JPM)'s Sapphire Cards,"In this article:

We recently published Jim Cramer Discussed These 13 Stocks & Shared Major Warning For Rare Earth Stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, roiled markets recently when he commented that he was worried about “cockroaches.” While Mr. Dimon likely isn’t suffering from an insect outbreak, his comments pointed to the bankruptcy of auto parts company First Brands. Dimon warned that there were likely more firms like First Brand, commenting that “when you see one cockroach,” you’re likely to encounter more. He added that there might be some “excess” in the credit market, given its bull run since 2010. Cramer also discussed JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s Sapphire cards and their advertisements, as well as the “cockroach” comment:

“[On race among credit card issuers to cater to high income high earners with perks] I’m watching these Sapphire ads and I said, this must be an ad for Temu or Shein. Cause like those ads, you know they didn’t have anything to do with credit cards, I know that much. “JPMorgan’s been disappointing since they reported. But I think if you decide to say, hey listen, if you used a cockroach metaphor, I don’t wanna go buy your stock.”

While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

JPM,Finance Sector Provides Flying Start to Q3 Earnings Season,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>

Here are the key points:

For the 99 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +13.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 86.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 99 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 75.8%.

For the Finance sector, we now have Q3 results from 54.5% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +23.0% from the same period last year on +12.0% higher revenues, with 97.0% beating EPS estimates and 87.9% beating revenue estimates.

The Finance sector’s Q3 earnings performance is tracking significantly above what we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, both in terms of the earnings and revenue growth pace as well as the beats percentages. In fact, the sector’s Q3 revenue beats percentage of 87.9% is the highest for this group of companies over the preceding 20-quarter period.

The above-average beats percentages at this stage of the Q3 reporting cycle are notable in light of the favorable revisions trend that was in place ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, actual Finance sector results came in ahead of expectations that had already moved up before these results came in.

Strong Start to the Q3 Earnings Season

American Express AXP became the latest Finance player to beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, also offering positive, reassuring commentary on the health of the consumer and the broader economy. The American Express results followed similar results and commentary from the likes of JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC, and others.

The economic read-through from these bank results is reassuring and positive, notwithstanding worries about non-bank lenders following a few bankruptcies. Consumer spending and household financials remain stable on the back of a labor market that remains very strong. There are signs of improving credit demand, and delinquencies are off their highs, references to ‘cockroaches’ notwithstanding.

Importantly, the capital markets business has finally started showing results, after many quarters of management teams describing improving deal pipelines. We are still at low levels relative to history. But given the favorable regulatory and monetary policy backdrop, it is reasonable to get excited about the sector’s Wall Street business.

For the 54.5% of the sector’s market capitalization that have reported Q3 results, total earnings and revenues are up +23.0% and +12.0%, respectively, and 97.0% are beating EPS estimates and 87.9% are beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these Finance sector companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 87.9%.

The comparison charts below show the Q3 revenue growth rates and blended beats percentages for these companies.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

For the Zacks Finance sector as a whole, Q3 earnings are expected to increase by +23.4% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The Earnings Big Picture

Positive Q3 results and reassuring management commentary from these banks are helping sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place lately.

For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +7.3% on +6.7% revenue gains. We have consistently shown in this space how Q3 estimates have steadily increased since the quarter began.

The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q3 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.

The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis.

JPM,"Volvo Cars' Q3 profit edges up as cost cuts offset tariffs, price competition","By Marie Mannes

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Volvo Cars reported on Thursday a small rise in adjusted profit for the third quarter despite tariffs and tough competition as a drastic cost-cutting programme delivered faster than expected.

The group, which is based in Sweden but majority-owned by China’s Geely Holding, said operating profit before restructuring costs totalled 5.9 billion crowns ($627 million) in July-September against a year-earlier 5.8 billion despite a 7% sales drop with fully electric cars still accounting for less than a quarter of sales.

Profitability, however, improved from the second quarter, and analysts at JPM said in a note to clients that profits were above market expectations.

Hakan Samuelsson, a former CEO, was brought back this year as chief executive to help revive Volvo Cars’ low share price. He has since launched a cost-cutting programme slashing 3,000 jobs, pulled earnings guidance and slowed down investments.

The carmaker’s gross margin widened to 24.4% from the previous quarter’s 17.7%. Samuelsson told Reuters that was due to the best-selling XC60 model getting a facelift as well as big savings thanks to increased cooperation with Geely’s supply chain and the cost-cutting programme.

“What we’re now seeing is really, wow okay, this is delivering faster than we thought and faster than we planned,” Samuelsson said of the programme.

LOWER US TARIFFS

Volvo Cars is one of the European carmakers most exposed to U.S. tariffs as most of its U.S.-bound cars are exported from Europe. However, it has recently taken steps to move production of some hybrids to America in the coming years.

Recent trade negotiations between the European Union and the U.S. resulted in a reduction of U.S. tariffs on European cars to 15% from August 1 retroactively, from 27.5% previously.

“We still face several challenges, including continued price competition and the effects of U.S. import tariffs,” Samuelsson said in a statement.

“However, the recent tariff agreement between the U.S. and EU offers much-needed clarity and also lowers tariffs for imports to the EU.”

JPM,"Tom Lee Says Bearish Sentiment Mirrors 2008, But Performance Is A 'V-Shaped Rally' With S&P 500 Possibly Breaching 7,000 By Year End - Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS)","Tom Lee, the chief investment officer of Fundstrat Capital, has labeled the 2025 market “the most hated V-shaped rally,” arguing that investors are gripped by a level of pessimism typically seen only during severe bear markets, despite hopes of the S&P 500 hitting the 7,000 mark by year-end.

Investor Pessimism In 2025 Mirrors Previous Bear Markets

Lee pointed to persistent negative investor sentiment as a key anomaly in an update published on Fundstrat’s YouTube channel on Oct. 21. He highlighted recent AAII survey data showing bears outnumbering bulls, a trend that has defined the year.

“The last three times we had negative sentiment [this low] was 1990, 2008 and 2022. Those were all bear market years,” Lee said.

He contrasted this deep-seated fear with the market’s actual performance. “Investors are acting like we’re in a bear market, yet the market’s up 13% year to date,” Lee stated. “So, I would call that the most hated V-shaped rally.”

Resilient Corporate Earnings Drive Markets

Lee is building his bullish case on a foundation of resilient corporate earnings. He noted that 84% of S&P 500 companies have beaten estimates so far this season, driven by “solidly” positive results from major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS).

This combination of widespread fear and strong fundamentals, Lee argues, provides fuel for the market to move significantly higher.

S&P 500 To Breach 7,000 By Year End

In a subsequent appearance on CNBC’s Closing Bell on Oct. 22, Lee expanded on his outlook, predicting a “setup for a chase into year end” as under-invested players are forced to capitulate.

He reaffirmed his S&P 500 target, stating, “I think all of this means that the S&P can close at least at 7,000,” adding, “I actually think that’s a low number.”

Looking ahead, Lee cited “plenty [of] catalyst[s]” for the next 12 months, including an anticipated Federal Reserve easing cycle, improving “AI visibility” driving mega-cap earnings, and an eventual recovery in the ISM manufacturing index, which has been in contraction for 32 months.

On Thursday, the futures of the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 indices were trading in a mixed manner

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the S&P 500 index ended 0.53% lower at 6,699.40, whereas the Nasdaq 100 index fell 0.99% to 24,879.01. On the other hand, Dow Jones declined 0.71% to end at 46,590.41.

JPM,Finance Sector Provides Flying Start To Q3 Earnings Season,"Image Source: Unsplash

For the 99 S&P 500 members that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +13.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 86.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 99 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 75.8%.

For the Finance sector, we now have Q3 results from 54.5% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +23.0% from the same period last year on +12.0% higher revenues, with 97.0% beating EPS estimates and 87.9% beating revenue estimates.

The Finance sector’s Q3 earnings performance is tracking significantly above what we have seen from the sector in other recent periods, both in terms of the earnings and revenue growth pace as well as the beats percentages. In fact, the sector’s Q3 revenue beats percentage of 87.9% is the highest for this group of companies over the preceding 20-quarter period.

The above-average beats percentages at this stage of the Q3 reporting cycle are notable in light of the favorable revisions trend that was in place ahead of the start of this earnings season. In other words, actual Finance sector results came in ahead of expectations that had already moved up before these results came in.

Strong Start to the Q3 Earnings Season

American Express (AXP - Free Report) became the latest Finance player to beat Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, also offering positive, reassuring commentary on the health of the consumer and the broader economy. The American Express results followed similar results and commentary from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM - Free Report), Citigroup (C - Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC - Free Report), and others.

The economic read-through from these bank results is reassuring and positive, notwithstanding worries about non-bank lenders following a few bankruptcies. Consumer spending and household financials remain stable on the back of a labor market that remains very strong. There are signs of improving credit demand, and delinquencies are off their highs, references to ‘cockroaches’ notwithstanding.

Importantly, the capital markets business has finally started showing results, after many quarters of management teams describing improving deal pipelines. We are still at low levels relative to history. But given the favorable regulatory and monetary policy backdrop, it is reasonable to get excited about the sector’s Wall Street business.

For the 54.5% of the sector’s market capitalization that have reported Q3 results, total earnings and revenues are up +23.0% and +12.0%, respectively, and 97.0% are beating EPS estimates and 87.9% are beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these Finance sector companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 87.9%.

The comparison charts below show the Q3 revenue growth rates and blended beats percentages for these companies.

For the Zacks Finance sector as a whole, Q3 earnings are expected to increase by +23.4% from the same period last year on +7.8% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.

The Earnings Big Picture

Positive Q3 results and reassuring management commentary from these banks are helping sustain the favorable revisions trend that has been in place lately.

For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +7.3% on +6.7% revenue gains. We have consistently shown in this space how Q3 estimates have steadily increased since the quarter began.

The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q3 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.

The aforementioned favorable revisions trend validates the market’s rebound from the April lows. However, the trend can only be sustained if Q3 earnings results and management guidance for Q4 and beyond confirm it.

The largest U.S. health insurer's stock has climbed by 5.09% in the past month, exceeding the Medical sector's gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.13%.

Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of UnitedHealth Group in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on October 28, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.84, showcasing a 60.28% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $113.38 billion, indicating a 12.46% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

UNH's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $16.16 per share and revenue of $448.48 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -41.58% and +12.04%, respectively.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for UnitedHealth Group. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.

Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

The firm has a 1.5% quarterly-paid dividend yield, underpinned with robust free cash flow generation and a conservative 0.73 debt/equity ratio, indicating potential for both growth investment and further buybacks.

UnitedHealth Tops on Earnings

UnitedHealth Group’s Q2 2025 earnings were a decisive move toward winning back investor confidence. The group published adjusted EPS of $16, beating the Street, with revenues for the year between $445.5 billion and $448.0 billion. Though overall growth is tepid, the revised guidance from the management indicated stabilization of the trend for medical costs and early efficiency gains from technology-based initiatives.

“UnitedHealth Group has taken an ambitious journey back to being a high-performing organization serving the full health needs of people and society at large,” said CEO Stephen Hemsley. The company’s initiatives to “enforce stronger operating disciplines” are likely to form the template for future growth, 2026 and onwards.

One of the central components of that strategy is the increasing role for Optum as an intelligence-enabled engine for predictive care and population health. Through the use of data analytics to automate the processing of claims and advance clinical results, UnitedHealth is unwinding administrative friction and increasing profitability for its Medicare and commercial lines. The technology shift is also helping to balance higher utilization rates, especially for outpatient care.

The company suspended 2025 guidance first this year but reaffirmed it following Q2, indicating optimism regarding its direction. The firm predicts net earnings for the year of at least $14.65 per share and $16.00 adjusted EPS, indicating a return to year-over-year earnings next fiscal year.

UNH,Popular Republican Takes EARLY LEAD with Surprise Bid to FLIP Key U.S. Senate Seat - Conservative Angle,"A former Republican Senator just upturned the election landscape for one particular seat in the U.S. Senate.

And he did so in more ways than one — possibly with the direction and support of President Trump.

I say possibly, because that endorsement hasn’t been publicly announced yet. Though White House meetings have taken place which reportedly included President Trump. (More on that as we get into this.)

Former US Senator John E. Sununu just launched a re-election bid after more than 16 years since he last held office.

And he is instantly favored to win the Republican primary in New Hampshire for a key US Senate seat.

According to polling, he also stands a greater chance of flipping that Senate seat to the GOP than does his nearest Republican rival.

Rumors have been swirling for some time as calls went up, first to John’s brother to join the Republican fight and then to John, to help regain Democrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen’s seat following her retirement.

Chris Sununu wasn’t interested.

But then the White House got involved, with President Trump reportedly eyeing John Sununu as the most likely path to a GOP victory in the race — despite the checkered past between the two.

That brings us to today, with John Sununu making his splash into the NH Senate election with this campaign video shared online earlier today:

Here’s a full screen version of his campaign video from YouTube for easier viewing:

Sununu may be angling for changing the temperature in DC and doing his best to pull the Senate back towards fiscal responsibility, as he claims in that video.

But the splash he made today isn’t a sure path to victory in either the Primary or the General Election.

His first hurdle will be overcoming his nearest Republican rival in the Primary, as reported by Fox News:

Former Republican Sen. John E. Sununu of New Hampshire wants his old job back.

And on Wednesday, Sununu took a big first step towards returning to Capitol Hill as he announced his candidacy in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New England’s only swing state.

Now, after nearly two decades in the private sector, Sununu is ready to return to the Senate campaign trail in New England’s only swing state.

“Maybe you’re surprised that I’m running for the Senate again,” Sununu says to the camera in his video. “I’m a bit surprised myself. Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now. Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”

Sununu is a brand name in New Hampshire politics. The former senator’s father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor who later served as chief of staff in then-President George H.W. Bush’s White House. And one of his younger brothers is former Gov. Chris Sununu, who won election and re-election to four two-year terms steering the Granite State.

But Sununu won’t have a glide path to the GOP nomination.

Former ambassador and former Sen. Scott Brown, who was elected and served three years in the Senate in neighboring Massachusetts, and who, as the 2014 GOP Senate nominee in New Hampshire, narrowly lost to Shaheen during her first re-election, jumped into the race in late June.

One set of polling numbers published last week showed that in a matchup against Chris Pappas, Sununu would fair far better at closing the gap against the Democrat than Republican Scott Brown in a General Election:

It’s not everything, but polling matters.

And it would be foolish to ignore the recent polling that suggests Sununu already has a large lead over Scott Brown in the Republican Primary.

Check out this article for a breakdown of the fight brewing between Sununu and his Republican rival in the Primary, and those polls.

As well as what appears to be some very shrewd political angling by President Trump, as covered by a local CBS News affiliate:

Former Senator John Sununu entered the race Wednesday. That means former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown won’t have the Republican primary to himself. In fact, recent polling suggests Sununu could be Brown’s worst nightmare.

A UNH Survey Center/Granite State poll shows Sununu crushing Brown by 23 points among likely primary voters. Perhaps it’s more recognition of the famous family name than anything else, but Sununu, brother of former governor Chris Sununu, has a solid 50 percent favorable rating among Republicans, while Brown, the state party’s 2014 senatorial nominee, draws a measly 30 percent.

And expert observers say Sununu’s emergence reflects how electability may be trumping loyalty in Trump world these days.

“Trump, on the one hand, may hold in his heart some grudges against Sununu,” said UNH Political Science Professor Dante Scala. “But there’s also the, I think he knows: Don’t back no losers.”

Even a few years ago, the type of criticism of Trump levied by Brown and Sununu might have been enough to get you exiled. (Emphasis added.)

That article came out just prior to John Sununu’s announcement this morning.

Here’s a video report from the same CBS affiliate for those who prefer a little deeper dive into the fight between Brown and Sununu:

As I said, polling isn’t everything.

The success or failure of a campaign like this is likely to hinge on who you have in your corner.

Though the President reportedly met with Sununu at the White House prior to his announcement, President Trump hasn’t yet given a public endorsement.

But several others have, including South Carolina’s Tim Scott:

And as Danielle included in her report yesterday, a memo has started circulating among Republicans arguing in favor of Sununu as the best candidate to flip the seat in favor of Republicans:

Former Republican Senator Expected To Launch Comeback Bid

Rep. Michael Granger of New Hampshire’s State House also weighed in favoring Sununu over Brown.

Granger is part of the Liberty Caucus in NH, but was clear in his endorsement that he doesn’t speak for the Caucus:

Here’s the full text of Granger’s explanation as to why he is supporting John Sununu for the Senate Seat instead of Brown:

Hello, NH. I’m endorsing John Sununu for Senate. Let me explain my reasoning.

John Sununu is a known quantity. We can look at the way John Sununu voted when he was in the Senate, compare that to the way another candidate voted when he was in the senate, and make a fairly objective judgement on the matter. Having done so, I came to the following conclusion:

I like John Sununu’s voting record.

An anecdote: Both John Sununu and another candidate were put in positions where they boldly opposed the rest of their caucus in a major vote. I’ve been there. It’s a lot of pressure at the state level, I imagine it’s even more pressure at the federal level. Sometimes you just have to do what you think is best, though, and be that one guy that goes, “No.”

John Sununu was that guy when he boldly voted against the PATRIOT act. There is another candidate who was that guy when he boldly voted in favor of an assault weapons ban. John Sununu broke with his party to protect liberty. This other candidate broke with his party to infringe upon liberty.

I haven’t just looked at these two votes, but they are indicative of the overall trend of what we can expect. It seems to me that John Sununu appears to be a better candiate for the cause of liberty than other candidates are. I respect anyone in my caucus who disagrees with me, and in the event that someone else wins the primary I’ll be more than happy to support their efforts because they are probably infinitely superior to Chris Pappas.

PS: I shouldn’t have to point this out but I will anyway: I am not speaking on behalf of the Liberty Caucus here. The Liberty Caucus has not endorsed in this race. I, personally, am. Thank you for abiding by this detail.

I included that explanation because it did such a good job summarizing some of the key aspects that sets Sununu and Brown apart on the Republican side of the race.

Just the fact that he voted AGAINST the PATRIOT Act while he was Senator back in the day tells me a lot.

Brown’s record voting IN FAVOR of an ‘assault weapon’ ban… tells me just as much.

Nevertheless, a lot hinges on whether President Trump is ready to go all-in with Sununu.

After his support of Kasich and Nikki Haley — as well as some not so nice articles about President Trump…

The endorsement of the President isn’t something John Sununu should take for granted, as Brown emphasized in this response to Sununu’s candidacy:

Still, President Trump isn’t one to back a losing hand.

Particularly when it comes to a Senate seat that very well could mean the difference between getting his agenda passed through Congress… and having it stall out over the next few years.

And John Sununu wouldn’t be the first person who started out resisting President Trump as a candidate, only to change his tune somewhere along the way. (Yours truly, included.)

He DID come out swinging for President Trump in the leadup to last year’s election, squarely in the President’s corner.

And that’s something.

It seems apparent that everything rides on President Trump’s willingness to throw his weight behind Sununu’s Senate campaign.

And for that… we’ll keep our eyes peeled. And bring you all the details if and when that plays out.",Brigitte Gabriel,2025-10-23T03:08:10Z,https://conservativeangle.com/popular-republican-takes-early-lead-with-surprise-bid-to-flip-key-u-s-senate-seat/,0.8,2025-10-23 17:22:25.596096,,0.2156862745098038
UNH,Editor's Notebook: Swarming Windham defense second to none,"A quick notebook check as the autumn high school seasons enter make-or-break time ...
• No Division I football team has allowed fewer points in NHIAA play than Windham High. The Jaguars lost their league opener at Pinkerton Academy, 28-0, and since then have allowed 13 points in five league games, all wins.
The relentless nature of their defenders showed this past Friday night when the Jags posted their third shutout, 28-0, against Manchester Central at Gill Stadium. Senior defensive end Rob Durkin started the party by returning a fumble 32 yards for a touchdown on the game’s first play. For the game, the Little Green were limited to 157 total yards from scrimmage.
When asked what makes Windham’s defense so good, Central coach Ryan Ray had a quick answer.
“No. 1, speed. No. 2, speed. No. 3, speed.”
Durkin had his own take.
“Everyone on our team plays through the whistle on every play,” he said. “Any time anyone (an opposing player) is in the open field, we’re swarming him, driving him back. We have 11 guys who play hard every single play.”
Windham’s new head coach, Matt Lee, who came over from Alvirne, told his players postgame that the offense and special teams need to match the efficiency of the defense “if we want to do anything in November.”
Defensively, though, nothing needs to change, it seems.
“In high school football, sometimes you have a couple of weak links (on defense),” he said. “But I feel like we have a really solid group throughout. Our defensive line — Sam Raidoulis is a basketball kid who decided to come out and play football and he’s playing really well at defensive end ... Durkin ... our D line is the engine of our defense. Parker Francis, an inside linebacker, is doing a really good job.
“So I think we do a solid enough job at all three levels. We have 11 good football players on the field.”
Elsewhere from the notebook ...
• Back in the summer, when Drake Maye was playing catch with little kids at Londonderry High, Patriots fans were hoping for something close to a .500 season. A playoff spot seemed doubtful. I heard it everywhere. Clearly, Pats fans have changed their tune — thanks in large part to Maye.
• George Springer’s home run on Monday night, while it wasn’t a walk-off, has to be one of most clutch hits in baseball history. And it happened on Oct. 20 — 49 years and 364 days after Bernie Carbo and Carlton Fisk hit memorable homers in the same postseason game you may remember.
• Perhaps I’ve asked this question before, but is there anyone out there (not from the Toronto area) pulling for the Blue Jays because you grew to like the ones who stopped in Manchester for some professional growth? Not just now, in the World Series against the Dodgers.
What I mean is, do you root for the former Fisher Cats during the regular season against the Red Sox and Yankees?
That group of ex-Fishers includes manager John Schneider, whose lone season (2018) here resulted in an Eastern League championship. Those who dealt with Schneider say he was — and still is — the real thing.
• On to hockey. Boston College hosts Denver on Friday in a rematch of the 2025 NCAA regional final played at the SNHU Arena. You know, the last-ever (?) hockey game, not counting charity games or high schoolers, played at the arena? UNH transfer Ryan Conmy has two goals thus far for the Eagles (2-1-1). The school has announced that Friday’s game is sold out.
• Speaking of UNH, the view from the seats last Saturday night at Merrimack College revealed an offense-challenged hockey team.
The Wildcats generated 21 shots and one early goal. Their O-zone time was limited, with one notable exception being a third-period stretch of 2 minutes, 20 seconds of constant pressure before the gassed Warriors finally got a whistle.
It can be expected, though, that offensive cohesion for UNH will take time as all those junior hockey products and transfers get acclimated to Mike Souza’s system. Look for a better showing this coming weekend as the home season opens at the Whittemore Center with Long Island University and Quinnipiac coming in. LIU is no pushover — the Sharks played No. 5 Penn State tough last weekend — and the sixth-ranked Bobcats under Bedford native Rand Pecknold are the ECAC favorites and are always in the NCAA tournament conversation.

UNH,Freshman soccer player from midcoast picked right time for 1st UMaine goal,"Rockport’s Britta Denny will be the answer to a University of Maine sports trivia question: Who scored the Black Bears’ first-ever game-winning goal at their new New Balance Track and Field and Soccer Complex?

It was also the freshman right wing’s first collegiate goal. She scored it off a beautiful diagonal pass from Emma Nicholson to give the Black Bears a 1-0 lead over the University of Maryland Baltimore County with 22:34 remaining in the game on Sunday afternoon. The Black Bears went on to win 2-0.

It was UMaine’s first victory on its new field following a 1-1 tie with Bryant University and a 1-0 loss to the University of Vermont.

Denny ran on to the ball down the left wing side and calmly guided it past UMBC goalkeeper Kalli Willilams with the inside of her right foot from eight yards out.

“Emma did all the hard work. She made an amazing run and beat two defenders,” Denny said. “All I had to do was tap it into the goal.”

Nicholson had sprinted down the field to track down a long pass from Luise Reinwald before cleverly beating a defender with an outside-inside move, taking a few strides toward the penalty area and sliding the ball across to the far side to Denny.

“It felt so good,” Denny added. “My goal this year was to score and I’m glad I accomplished it.”

UMaine head coach Scott Atherley said Denny has been a “great story” on the Black Bears team.

“She gets better every day. She competes every day and shows she belongs at this level,” Atherley said.

In her first seven appearances, Denny averaged 13.4 minutes of playing time per game.

Over the last four, she has doubled her playing time, averaging 27.5 minutes per game.

That is a testament to her improvement, said Atherley.

He pointed out that when they break down the video after each game, he and his assistants Alexis Smith and Tiana Bucknor have noticed that Denny “gets on the ball a lot” and is “always in good position.”

The former All-American midfielder at Camden Hills High School in Rockport has “terrific potential,” according to Atherley.

“She has a real knack around the goal. She’s going to be a real goal scorer for us at this level,” he said about the freshman who turns 19 in November.

Denny isn’t a newcomer to the right wing position. She explained that she plays right wing for her club team, Seacoast United.

“I’ve gotten to know the position pretty well,” said the daughter of Eric and Andrea Denny.

“I feel like wing is where I can flourish and be creative and stuff. It takes a lot of experience to play midfield at the college level,” Denny said. “Wing is a better spot for me right now.”

Denny, who scored 31 goals as a sophomore at Camden Hills and was a three-time Maine Soccer Coaches Association North Regional All-Star, said it has been a big adjustment from high school to college soccer.

“It’s more rigorous and time-consuming. You have to put in a lot more work,” Denny said. “But I came prepared. I just love to play soccer and I’m glad to be able to do it every day. Going to practice is my favorite time of the day.”

She is getting more comfortable every week.

“I’m glad I’m getting the opportunity in games to show off my potential,” Denny said.

She loves her teammates, saying they were “so welcoming” when she and other newcomers arrived.

“Getting to know them the past couple of months has been so much fun,” Denny said.

And playing on the new field has been a memorable experience.

“It’s so nice. We’re so lucky to have it,” Denny said.

The youthful defending two-time America East tournament champion Black Bears, who graduated players who scored 21 of their 32 goals last season, are currently 2-2-2 in the conference and 3-6-3 overall. They are tied for fifth with UMass Lowell with eight points. But they are just one point out of third place, which is shared by Bryant and New Hampshire.

They will travel to play New Jersey Institute of Technology (0-3-3, 5-5-6) on Saturday at 6 p.m. before hosting UNH (2-1-3, 4-4-6) in the regular season finale next Thursday at 6 p.m.

UMaine’s win over UMBC was impressive, as the Black Bears were without starting center backs Rebecca Grisdale and Lea Schroder, who have been lost for the season due to lower body injuries sustained the week before the UMBC game.

They have been replaced by Olivia Grisdale, Rebecca’s sister who had been playing in the midfield, and Campbell University transfer Meghan Bernetti.

“The whole team stepped up. It was probably our best performance of the year,” Atherley said about the UMBC win. “That says a lot about our team.”",Bangor Daily News,2025-10-22T19:31:10Z,https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/10/22/sports/college-soccer/britta-denny-1st-umaine-soccer-goal/,0.4,2025-10-23 17:22:43.051533,,0.1372549019607843
AMZN,Amazon (AMZN) Introduces New Warehouse Robot Designed to Perform Several Tasks at Once,"E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has introduced a new warehouse robot system called Blue Jay, which is designed to do several tasks at once. Interestingly, the system uses robotic arms with suction cups that can pick up, sort, and group different types of items in one place. This combines what used to be three separate stations into one. Amazon says that Blue Jay is meant to help workers by reducing physical strain and by saving space. Moreover, it’s currently being tested in a South Carolina warehouse and can handle about 75% of the items stored there.

However, the use of automation has led many to question how jobs will be impacted. Indeed, a recent New York Times (NYT) report said that the company could avoid hiring over 160,000 U.S. workers by 2027, while saving around $0.30 per item packed and delivered. Nevertheless, Amazon responded by saying that the report gave an incomplete view and only reflected one team’s plans, not the company’s full hiring strategy.

Outside the warehouse, Amazon is also adding new tech for its delivery drivers. More precisely, the company introduced smart glasses with AI, cameras, and sensors that help drivers scan packages, get directions, and even alert them to dogs on a property. In addition, the glasses include a vest-attached controller with an emergency button and were tested with hundreds of drivers during development.

What Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on Amazon stock based on 42 Buys assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average AMZN stock price target of $268.08 per share implies 23.3% upside potential from current levels.

AMZN,The smartest ASX ETFs for beginner investors to buy,"Starting your investing journey can feel intimidating. With thousands of shares to choose from and endless opinions about where the market is headed, it is easy to feel stuck before you even begin.

That's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come in.

They allow you to invest in hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of shares at once, giving you instant diversification and a stress-free way to build wealth over time.

If you're a beginner investor looking to start small and build a strong foundation, the three ASX ETFs listed below stand out right now. Here's why they could be smart picks:

BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ)

If you want exposure to the world's best stocks, it is hard to look past the BetaShares Nasdaq 100 ETF. This fund tracks the performance of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the United States, which is home to some of the world's best-known brands.

Its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These are companies driving global technological change and long-term economic growth.

For beginners, this means that this ASX ETF offers a simple way to own a slice of the innovation shaping the future, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to e-commerce and digital advertising.

BetaShares Australian Quality ETF (ASX: AQLT)

While it is great to have global exposure, it is also smart to own a piece of Australia's strongest shares. The BetaShares Australian Quality ETF focuses on homegrown businesses with high returns on equity, low debt, and consistent earnings growth.

The fund's holdings include some of Australia's most respected names such as Wesfarmers Ltd (ASX: WES), CSL Ltd (ASX: CSL), Pro Medicus Ltd (ASX: PME), Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG), and ResMed Inc. (ASX: RMD). These are companies that have built long-term competitive advantages and continue to generate solid profits year after year.

For new investors, the BetaShares Australian Quality ETF offers an easy way to own a basket of high-quality Australian shares without the need to pick individual winners. This provides a great foundation for the domestic portion of a beginner's portfolio.

BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF (ASX: ASIA)

Finally, the BetaShares Asia Technology Tigers ETF could be a powerful way for beginners to tap into the growth story unfolding across Asia.

It invests in the region's biggest and most innovative tech companies, providing exposure to a market many Australian investors often overlook.

Its top holdings include Tencent Holdings (SEHK: 700), Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD), and Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU).

These companies are shaping the future of digital life across Asia, from e-commerce and entertainment to cloud services and artificial intelligence. And with a rapidly growing middle class and rising technology adoption, the region is expected to remain one of the world's fastest-growing markets for years to come.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-23T07:18:55Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/23/the-smartest-asx-etfs-for-beginner-investors-to-buy/,0.5,2025-10-23 17:22:45.783437,,0.3254901960784313
AMZN,"CoreWeave Is 'Frightening... It's Unbelievable,' Says Expert, Expecting Its Revenue To Multiply Nearly 5x By 2028 - CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV)","Specialist AI cloud provider CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is on a “frightening” growth trajectory, with revenue projected to scale to “mid-$20s billion” by 2028, according to a leading digital infrastructure analyst. This forecast suggests its revenue could multiply “nearly 5x” from its 2025 projection of $5.3 billion.

Check out CRWV’s stock price here.

CoreWeave Could Scale Mid-$20 Billion In Revenue By 2028

The “unbelievable” forecast was shared by Nick Del Deo, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, on a recent episode of “The Real Eisman Playbook” podcast. The discussion highlighted CoreWeave’s explosive emergence as a critical infrastructure player in the artificial intelligence boom.

To put the company’s meteoric rise in context, Del Deo noted that CoreWeave’s total revenue in 2022 was approximately “$16 million.” The leap from that figure to a projected $5.3 billion in 2025, and then to a potential “mid-20s billion” by 2028, underscores the unprecedented demand for its services.

“It’s frightening. It’s unbelievable,” remarked the experts on the show.

From ‘Crypto Miner’ To AI Powerhouse: In The Same League As AT&T, Walmart

Del Deo noted that CRWV began as a crypto miner around 2017, and it has since pivoted to become a key partner for major AI players.

It has “exclusively leased its facilities” and fills them with specialized GPU equipment, attracting massive customers like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which currently accounts for 70% of its business, and OpenAI.

The scale of this build-out requires a level of spending Del Deo called “astronomical,” with a projected capital expenditure of “$21 to $23 billion” this year alone.

“In just a handful of years, their capital budget is in the same league as AT&T, Walmart, Exxon Mobil,” Del Deo stated, emphasizing the sheer scale of the operation. “There’s nothing else like CoreWeave out there.”

Big Tech’s Proprietary Businesses Could Wrestle CRWV

Despite the massive opportunity, Del Deo cautioned that CoreWeave faces future competition from the “big battleship businesses” of cloud computing, such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOOGL) Google, and Microsoft itself.

He suggested that as chip constraints ease, these incumbents will become “more effective” in the space, which could eventually “put some pressure on CoreWeave’s returns over time.”

CRWV Logs Astronomical Returns Since Listing

Shares of CRWV have returned 203.83% since its listing in March. However, it was down 7.15% over the last month.

It maintains a stronger price trend over short and long terms, with a poor trend in the medium term. Additional performance details, as per Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings, are available here.

On Thursday, the futures of the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 indices were trading in a mixed manner

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the S&P 500 index ended 0.53% lower at 6,699.40, whereas the Nasdaq 100 index fell 0.99% to 24,879.01. On the other hand, Dow Jones declined 0.71% to end at 46,590.41.

AMZN,3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade | The Motley Fool,"What's a key downside of investing in a game-changing technology with fast-paced advances? One that immediately comes to mind is that there's no way to know for sure which stocks will be the biggest winners.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a great case in point. Some of the top AI names right now might not be at the top 10 years from now. Does this mean that buy-and-hold investing is futile with AI stocks? Not at all. Here are three AI stocks I think you can safely buy and hold for the next decade.

1. Alphabet

Once upon a time, some pundits predicted that generative AI would present an existential threat to Alphabet's (GOOG +0.47%) (GOOGL +0.46%) Google Search. You don't hear such dire warnings too much these days, though. Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Google Search continues to grow robustly.

Alphabet defied the expectations of some doomsayers by evolving its search engine to incorporate generative AI, introducing new features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode. The company also released one of the top-ranked large language models (LLMs) on the market, Google Gemini, which has an even more powerful version on the way soon.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in July, ""AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving

strong momentum."" He was right. His statement is especially true for Google Cloud. The unit's revenue soared 32% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining Google Cloud's position as the fastest-growing major cloud services provider.

I suspect we've only seen the beginning of how Alphabet will make money through AI. The company's Waymo business is a leader in the up-and-coming robotaxi market. Its Android XR operating system sets the stage for Alphabet to be a strong contender in the AI glasses market as well. I believe this company will be significantly larger 10 years from now, with AI serving as one of its biggest growth drivers.

2. Amazon

Amazon (AMZN 1.84%) recently made headlines with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that impacted many well-known businesses. I doubt many people will remember this public relations black eye a decade from now. Furthermore, I predict that AWS will rake in a lot more revenue than it does today.

Is AWS growing more slowly than its top rivals, such as Google Cloud? Yes. However, its revenue still jumped 17.5% year over year in Q2. And AWS continues to launch new capabilities, including agentic AI products, that should continue to attract new customers.

Meanwhile, Amazon is leveraging AI effectively to increase its overall profitability. For example, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model that controls over 1 million robots and is improving their travel efficiency. It's also using AI-powered demand forecasting to boost accuracy, optimize inventory placement, and reduce delivery times for millions of items purchased on its e-commerce platform.

Amazon is preparing to soon provide satellite internet service to customers using its Project Kuiper satellite network. I have no doubt the company will move into additional new markets over the next 10 years, some AI-related and others not.

3. Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT +0.56%) might have made the smartest deal in the age of AI so far with its partnership with OpenAI. As a result, the company has been able to integrate generative AI throughout its software products, making them more valuable than ever to users.

AI has also provided a huge tailwind for Microsoft Azure, which ranks as the second-largest cloud services provider after AWS. Business is booming for Azure, with Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment revenue jumping 27% year over year in its latest quarter.

Could Microsoft's momentum wane? Maybe, but I doubt it will. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the company's recent quarterly update, ""Cloud and AI is [sic] the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector."" The transformation he referred to is still in its early innings, in my view.

I think Microsoft's productivity products are ideal for agentic AI to show its value. I'm also glad to see the company expand its umbrella by offering Anthropic's Claude AI models as well as OpenAI's models in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Partnership With OneQode Highlighted

Safe & Green and its subsidiary, Olenox Corp., a unique energy provider, emphasized the importance of their Open Collaborative Framework partnership with OneQode on Tuesday, citing the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services outage that occurred on Monday, which disrupted websites and apps worldwide.

Michael McLaren, CEO of Safe & Green, said, ""It is critical to Olenox that data collection and two-way communication in the field are reliable, providing us with the ability to perform at maximum efficiency with little downtime while also meeting environmental commitments.""

Matt Shearing, CEO of OneQode, an Australian infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) company, said, “most people don’t realize that much of the technology AWS runs on is 25+ years old.”

The vertically integrated energy company aims to complete one drilling project in the fourth quarter of 2025, with an internal goal of producing 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2026, according to CEO Michael McLaren.

McLaren also said the company is refocusing its manufacturing efforts on container builds, anticipating ""a stellar 2026 for SGBX and its subsidiaries.""

Olenox is expanding its U.S. energy footprint through strategic acquisitions and field revitalization, in addition to its planned drilling program.

Stock Performance

Safe & Green Holdings is down 97.36% over the past year and 90.50% over the past six months.

The Texas-based company has traded between $2.03 and $122.88 in the past 52 weeks. The company has a market capitalization of $1.15 million and an average daily trading volume of 3.84 million shares.

Thoughtful Employer

As first reported by Bloomberg, Walmart has decided to pause job offers to candidates using H-1B visas, marking a major move for the retail sector and U.S. business in general. That’s because Walmart gave the green light to more than 2,000 H-1B visas in the first half of this year, more than any other retailer.

A Walmart spokesperson said it is “committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”

The H-1B allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to work in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. Jobs in fields such as mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical sciences often qualify.

However, concerned that replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign workers poses a threat to national security, President Trump signed an executive order last month imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B applicants.

That’s up from an average cost of between $4,535 and $17,885.

Tech Impact

It had been expected that the biggest impact of the changes would be on the U.S. tech sector. Amazon (AMZN) had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025, with rivals such as Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) securing more than 4,000 visas.

Business groups have objected to Trump’s decision, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently filing a lawsuit against the administration. It believes that the increased fee harms American businesses and forces them to either increase labor costs or lose access to skilled overseas talent.

Trump, whose tariff policy has the creation and protection of American jobs at its heart, believes the opposite. It is why political decisions are such a key risk for companies, including Walmart, and their investors.

For Walmart, which is increasingly diversifying its business away from bananas and back-to-school clothes to technology, it could potentially stymie some of those moves. That includes new AI shopping assistants and partnerships with major tech names such as OpenAI.

WMT,Fortescue share price rises on record-breaking quarter,"The Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG) share price is edging higher on Thursday morning.

At the time of writing, the iron ore giant's shares are up 1% to $20.60.

This follows the release of the miner's first quarter update before the market open.

Fortescue share price edge higher on quarterly update

Investors have been buying the company's shares after it reported record shipments during the three months.

According to the release, total iron ore shipments came in at a record-breaking 49.7 million tonnes (Mt) in the first quarter of FY 2026. This is 4% higher than the prior corresponding period thanks largely to a 2.1Mt contribution from the Iron Bridge operation.

One negative, though, was a sharp increase in Fortescue's hematite C1 unit cost. It came in at US$18.17 per wet metric tonne (wmt) for the three months, which is up 12% from US$16.29 per wmt in the fourth quarter of FY 2025. However, it is down 10% year on year.

Fortescue commanded a hematite average price of US$89 per dry metric tonne (dmt) for the quarter. This means it realised 87% of the average Platts 62% CFR Index.

Over at Iron Bridge, its concentrate pulled in US$121 per dmt for the three months. This represents 103% of the average Platts 65% CFR Index and 118% of the average Platts 62% CFR Index.

In light of this, the company ended the period with cash of US$4.6 billion and net debt of US$1.9 billion. This includes the payment of the FY 2025 final dividend of US$1.2 billion and capital expenditure of US$908 million in the quarter.

Commenting on the quarter, Fortescue Metals and Operations CEO, Dino Otranto, said:

Fortescue has delivered a strong start to FY26, achieving record first quarter shipments of 49.7Mt, up four per cent on the prior year. We reached important milestones this quarter, including the successful syndication of a Renminbi-denominated term loan and the establishment of new global partnerships that will help drive our profitable decarbonisation. We're continuing to see delivery of this on the ground, with 10 electric excavators in operation and construction of our 190MW solar farm at Cloudbreak now more than one third complete.

We've also started to implement our revised Hematite life of mine plan, underpinned by the inclusion of the recently acquired Blacksmith Project. The plan optimises material movement and orebody use, ensuring Fortescue remains positioned as a low-cost, capital-efficient operator, maximising value across our operations.

Outlook

Thanks to its strong start to the financial year, management has been able to reaffirm its guidance for FY 2026.

It continues to forecast iron ore shipments of 195Mt to 205Mt and C1 unit costs for hematite of US$17.50 to US$18.50 per wmt.

The company also expects to spend US$3.3 billion to US$4 billion on metals capital expenditure and US$400 million on energy capital expenditure.",Motley Fool Australia,2025-10-23T00:07:07Z,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/10/23/fortescue-share-price-rises-on-record-breaking-quarter/,1.0,2025-10-23 17:23:10.942667,,0.1529411764705881
WMT,Walmart makes a controversial move affecting job seekers,"Finding a job in today's economy is already challenging, with fewer openings available compared to recent years.

Now, job seekers face another setback after Walmart, one of the nation's largest employers, has made a controversial decision that could affect thousands of potential workers.

Walmart has paused all job offers to candidates requiring H-1B visas following the Trump administration's newly imposed $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applicants. This decision primarily impacts the retailer's corporate positions, rather than its in-store-level workforce.

With approximately 1.6 million U.S. employees, Walmart is among the country's largest private employers and has historically relied on the H-1B program. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the company employs around 2,390 H-1B visa holders.

""Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers, while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach,"" said a Walmart spokesperson to Bloomberg.

The H-1B visa program, introduced through the Immigration Act of 1990, allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign professionals in specialized fields requiring at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent.

According to Homeland Security, the program is designed to help U.S. businesses meet their critical workforce needs and remain competitive.

Walmart navigated uncertainty and higher costs

Given Walmart's (WMT) immense size and profitability, its decision to halt H-1B hiring may seem surprising.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company's revenue grew 4.8% year over year to $177.4 billion, with U.S. sales climbing 4.8% to $121.6 billion.

However, even the strongest corporations are navigating uncertainty. During an Investment Community Meeting on April 9, Walmart withdrew its earnings guidance for fiscal 2026, citing global market instability resulting from the recent tariff changes.

""As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week,"" said Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon in an earnings call.

""While these costs put pressure on operating income growth for the quarter and for the year-to-date period, they don't change our annual or long-term outlook, nor our conviction in our profit growth trajectory,"" he added.

Related: Walmart announces unexpected store closure

Walmart has also invested heavily in expansion. In January 2024, it launched its Investing in America plan, a multi-million-dollar effort to modernize stores, expand operations, and create more domestic jobs.

These strategic investments were partly responsible for an 8.2% decrease in the company's operating income to $0.7 billion in its latest reported quarter.

Walmart backs away from H-1B hiring amid tough U.S. job market

The labor market weakens as inflation, rising costs, and economic uncertainty make job hunting increasingly difficult. For many, prolonged unemployment is no longer sustainable, which only adds to their financial pressures.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Situation update, 911,000 fewer jobs than expected were added in the 12 months through March 2025, signaling a significant slowdown.

August brought only 22,000 new nonfarm payrolls, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest level in nearly four years.

""The job market continues to soften. Although we are not seeing extensive layoffs, the hiring rate is quite low, so those who lose jobs or new entrants to the job market are having quite a tough time finding new positions. This will result in a higher unemployment rate over the course of the next year,"" said The Mortgage Bankers Association Chief Economist Mike Fratantoni in a statement.

As companies like Walmart adapt to rising costs and new visa regulations, both domestic and international job seekers may find it even harder to secure suitable employment in the coming months.

WMT,Meme Stock Madness: Will Beyond Meat's 388% Pop End in Tears?,"Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has experienced a meteoric rise in its stock price over the past two days. After closing around $0.64 per share on Friday, BYND stock jumped to $1.53 per share by the end of Monday and was up to as much as $2.48 per share today, a 388% gain.

This spike has caught the attention of retail investors and meme stock enthusiasts, driving massive trading volume -- over 476 million shares today alone and far exceeding the daily average of 37.7 million.

Key factors behind the surge include BYND's addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (NYSEARCA:MEME), which targets volatile names popular among online traders. The plant-based meat company also announced an expanded partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), rolling out a new Beyond Burger 6-pack and increasing product availability to over 2,000 stores. Bank of America also recently highlighted BYND on its list of Reddit meme stocks to watch, echoing a similar call from 2021 that preceded volatility.

Yet the biggest catalyst is a short squeeze: with high short interest, rising stock prices have forced sellers to buy back shares, amplifying the rally.

But are these enough for BYND to hold onto its gains, or will it crash again?

The Illusion of Short-Term Catalysts

While BYND's stock can certainly skyrocket further in the near term -- potentially doubling or tripling again amid frenzied meme stock trading -- these drivers lack substance for long-term value. The risk of substantial losses escalates with each buy at higher prices, as the rally is built on speculation rather than business improvements.

Take the meme ETF addition: Roundhill's MEME fund includes BYND alongside other high-volatility plays, but this is more about capitalizing on trader hype than signaling operational strength. It's a passive inclusion based on social media buzz, not earnings growth.

Similarly, BAC's watchlist nod revives old meme stock narratives from 2021, when BYND soared then plunged 47% by year-end. These endorsements fuel temporary momentum but evaporate quickly once attention shifts.

Even the Walmart partnership, which sounds promising, falls short as a fundamental driver. Expanding distribution to more stores and launching a value pack aims to boost accessibility, but it doesn't address core demand issues. Plant-based meat alternatives aren't a broad trend set to dominate grocery aisles; they're a narrow niche appealing to a small segment of health-conscious or environmentally aware consumers.

Sales data tells the story: BYND reported a 20% year-over-year revenue decline in the second quarter, missing guidance by 9%. Net revenues continue to fall, with the company remaining deeply unprofitable -- it post losses quarter after quarter.",Yahoo! Finance,2025-10-23T06:35:38Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-madness-beyond-meat-073153555.html,0.6,2025-10-23 17:22:58.227010,,0.1294117647058823
WMT,"What's going on with Beyond Meat stock and why is it up 1,200% this week? | FXStreet","A short squeeze rally fueled its meteoric rise.

It has been quite a week for Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), a penny stock which has soared roughly 1,200% this week, at its peak.

The company, which makes plant-based meat alternatives, was trading at about 67 cents per share at the close of the market last Friday. By Wednesday morning, October 22, it had skyrocketed to roughly $8.70 per share – a gain of almost 1,200%.

After that, the selloff began, and the stock dropped all the way back down to about $3.35 per share as of Wednesday afternoon, down about 8% for the day. But it was still up roughly 400% this week.

Short squeeze in effect

The wild ride for Beyond Meat stock has many of the characteristics of a meme stock rally, driven by a short squeeze.

Prior to the runup this week, Beyond Meat had dropped to an all-time low, falling to a low of 55 cents per share last week after a debt restructuring deal was announced. The exchange offer led to the issuance of 316 million new shares, which resulted in shareholder dilution. After that, Beyond Meat got several analyst downgrades and was heavily shorted by investors, betting that the stock would fall.

But things started to change this week when Beyond Meat announced that it had expanded its relationship with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer its , Beyond Chicken Pieces, and Beyond Steak Korean BBQ-Style at more than 2,000 Walmart stores.

Also, this week, Beyond Meat stock was added to the Roundhill MEME Stock ETF (NYSEARCA: MEME). These two catalysts led to a rally, and ultimately a short squeeze, where investors started buying, which caused the short sellers to buy back in. This led to Beyond Meat stock skyrocketing.

“These things kind of take on a life of their own – whether it’s short covering or people jumping on board, the effect is the same,” Joseph Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading, told MarketWatch. “Everybody is looking for the next momentum move, and this happens to be the flavor of the day. I wouldn’t be shocked if a few others start to pop.”

Proceed with caution

As with any meme stock, investors should be very cautious. While the Walmart deal is a positive catalyst, Beyond Meat is not profitable and it has struggled to generate revenue. In the second quarter, it generated just $75 million in revenue, down 20% year over year. It had a net loss of $29 million, or 38 cents per share.

It is a leader in plant-based meats, with distribution deals with several restaurant chains, including McDonald’s, Denny’s, and TGI Friday’s, along with major grocery chains.",FXStreet,2025-10-23T05:33:29Z,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/whats-going-on-with-beyond-meat-stock-and-why-is-it-up-1-200-this-week-202510230533,0.6,2025-10-23 17:23:02.797403,,0.0980392156862746

Short Squeeze Rally

Shares surged 127% on Monday and 146.26% on Tuesday following the stock's addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (NYSE:MEME).

The company has made changes to its leadership team to help get back on track.

10 stocks we like better than Target ›

Shares of Target (NYSE: TGT) have declined a massive 65% since hitting a peak in 2021. That's a painful decline, but not actually all that unusual. The stock has lost 50% or more of its value three times in the last 30 years.

If you have a long-term investment horizon, and a strong stomach, now could be a once-in-a-decade opportunity to buy this iconic retailer.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

You don't become a Dividend King by accident

When looking at Target today there is one achievement that stands out. It has increased its dividend annually for more than five decades, making it a Dividend King. That's no small achievement; the only other retailers to have similarly impressive records are Genuine Parts, Lowe's, and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Target is No. 3 on the list, with Walmart showing up at No. 4. And only a portion of Genuine Parts' business is retail focused, as the core of its operation is making replacement auto parts.

All in, Target is an elite retailer. The key comparison point among these four companies, however, is very clearly Walmart, which has the most similar business. Genuine Parts and hardware store Lowe's are both specialty retailers. But Target and Walmart have a material difference in the way they operate their stores. Walmart focuses on ""everyday low prices"" and Target tries to provide a more premium experience and product assortment.

That basically means that Walmart doesn't delve into trends and fashion styles nearly as deeply as Target. Walmart is more of a basics business, while Target can, and has, made merchandising missteps that have left it out of favor with consumers. Target also tends to feel the pinch a bit more during periods of economic concern, like recessions, when consumers trade down to the cheapest possible retail options.

In some ways, the fact that Target is a Dividend King at all is a huge statement about the company's enduring strength as a business. In fact, what's interesting right now is that the trailing-12-month dividend payout ratio is currently around 50%. That suggests that the dividend is probably safe despite the massive stock price decline.

What's going on right now?

And yet Target's stock has indeed fallen massively, pushing the dividend yield up to a historically high 5%. If the company pulls off another business turnaround, as it has several times before over the past 50 years, you could not only end up collecting a huge income stream, but also be in line for material capital appreciation. This is very possibly a once-in-a-decade opportunity for dividend investors to get into Target.

Remember, dividends are paid at the discretion of the board of directors. So a cut is always possible. But the board raised the dividend in mid-2025, well aware of the problems the retailer has been facing. Sure, it was a token 1.8% increase, but the statement is very clear: The board of directors believes Target's future remains bright.

The board also brought in a new CEO to shake things up and help push for change. Another change that's taken place is in Target's approach to overseeing the company, from a one-person strategy to a team. It's unlikely that there's going to be a sudden turnaround in the business, but given the history it seems highly likely that Target will get back on track.

Target's story will take some time to play out

To be fair, risk-averse investors might want to avoid Target. It is still dealing with difficult consumer trends that favor Walmart's everyday low price model. But if you think in decades and not days, and love dividends, you should do a deep dive on Target right now. This could be a huge opportunity for you to lock in a great yield with what has long been an elite retailer.

The ‘safety net’ mentality

Most organisations today still view quality assurance as the last step before going live. It's treated as a safety net, something you do right at the end to catch whatever falls through the cracks.

This outdated perspective turns testing into reactive firefighting. By the time testers discover defects, it's too late – you're looking at costly rework and missed deadlines.

Quality isn’t a phase. It’s a mindset – continuously encouraged, embedded from day one and owned by everyone.

Instead of seeing testing as a checkbox exercise at the end of delivery, we need to recognise what it actually is by that stage: damage control. You're not improving quality; you're just measuring how bad things have become.

A real-world example

We often meet organisations that feel their QA team, once seen as a safety net, has become the biggest blocker in their business.

Recently, we spent time with a number of key clients, interviewing people across various roles – architects, business analysts, developers, testers, tech leads and product owners. What we discovered was revealing.

Their issues didn't start with QA at all. From the very beginning, requirements were unclear, collaboration was poor and teams weren't allowed to talk to each other directly.

Here's how their typical process worked: BAs would receive a one-liner requirement from a product owner, then spend weeks getting approval for their documentation. Meanwhile, developers needed to start building the features without clear specifications.

By the time the requirement landed with the testers, they had no context. What should I test? How does this integrate with other systems? What's the expected behaviour?

Because testing happened at the last step before go-live, it was perceived as the blocker. Nobody looked at the BA component or the development phase, only at testing, because that's where the delays became visible.

Testing vs quality assurance: Understanding the difference

Here's the fundamental distinction that many organisations miss: testing is just one task. It's the act of executing tests to find defects and ensure functionality works before release.

Quality assurance is something entirely different. It's a holistic process of preventing bugs and defects, improving collaboration and embedding quality at every step from the very start.

This is where the ""shift left"" approach comes in. Shift left is a mindset that modern, mature Agile teams need to adopt.

It means involving QA early, from design discussions and requirements analysis. It means spotting potential issues before they become actual problems.

When testers are involved in requirement sessions and know the system well enough, they can identify what might not work. Catching defects at this stage is exponentially cheaper and faster than finding them in production.

The benefits extend beyond cost savings. You get continuous feedback loops, much better collaboration and genuine shared accountability across the team.

The speed vs quality trap

Speed and quality are consistently the top two challenges I hear about. Developers are operating at the speed of light, with no time for unit testing anymore.

All the testing burden falls on testers, who need to test everything end-to-end. But here's the cruel irony: when deadlines get missed or scope changes, organisations always cut back on testing time, never on development.

Testing cycles get shorter and shorter. Coverage gets smaller and smaller.

If you involve testers from the very start – working with BAs and developers throughout – by the time the requirement hits the formal testing phase, 70% of your testing has already been done. Testers know exactly what to look for and what to test.

This is a proactive quality approach, not reactive damage control.

Four steps to transform to quality

So how do you actually make this shift? Based on conversations with clients across industries, here are four practical steps:

1. Eliminate silos

Make sure your roles work much closer together from the initial planning sessions and requirements gathering. Break down the walls between BAs, developers and testers.

2. Foster Agile principles

I'm a strong believer in Agile principles for creating collaborative environments. Encourage people to talk and communicate regularly, not just log tickets in a tool.

If team members aren't allowed to speak to each other, you have a serious problem. Direct communication eliminates assumptions and ambiguity.

3. Get leadership buy-in

True transformation only happens when it comes from the top. Leaders need to promote a quality-first approach and lead by example.

Start small: involve QA in sprint planning, backlog refinement and design sessions. Build from there.

4. Adopt shift left

Make shift left your default mindset. Bring testers into conversations earlier and earlier until it becomes second nature.

Back to basics

Here's what strikes me most about all these conversations: the solution isn't complex. It's actually about going back to basics.

Too often, organisations operating at pace start taking shortcuts. Documentation isn't done properly, tools aren't used effectively, communication drops, ceremonies get skipped.

These basics exist for a reason. If you keep them intact, they're time-savers, not time-wasters.

It comes down to management – leaders who empower their teams, provide frameworks to operate from and let teams own the quality aspect with genuine accountability and responsibility. Most importantly, they don't rely on testing to be their quality control.

Think of it like construction. If your foundation isn't laid properly and you end up with skewed walls, you can't paint those walls straight – it simply won't work.

Requirements gathering from a BA perspective is your foundation. Development is your build. Quality assurance should be present in every single phase.

Testing then becomes the finishing touches, making sure everything operates according to plan and functions as intended. Not the last-ditch attempt to catch what everyone else missed.

The organisations that thrive are those that see BAs, developers and testers not as separate functions, but as one unified team with a shared goal. That's when quality stops being a phase and becomes imbedded everywhere.",ITWeb,2025-10-23T08:39:27Z,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/quality-assurance-vs-testing-why-your-software-projects-keep-failing/LPp6VMrBKXyMDKQz,0.8,2025-10-23 17:23:21.343472,,0.05098039215686279
BA,"Mumbai: Major Fire Erupts At Jogeshwari High-Rise; 24 Rescued, No Injuries Reported (Video)","Mumbai: Several people are stranded in a commercial high-rise in Jogeshwari West, and firefighters are carrying out rescue operations. Twenty-four trapped people have been rescued from various floors through the staircase. A massive fire erupted at the JNS Business Center, located on SV Road near Gandhi School.

BA,'Hostility to independent scholarship': Congress condemns deportation of Francesca Orsini,"The deportation of London-based scholar Francesca Orsini has drawn sharp criticism from Congress, which described the government’s move as a clear sign of hostility toward independent scholarship.
“The decision to bar her from the country is not a matter of immigration formality but a symptom of the Modi government's hostility towards independent, serious-thinking, professional scholarship,” Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said.
Orsini, professor emerita at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, was sent back from IGI Airport on Monday, shortly after arriving from Hong Kong.
According to sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs, she had been on a ‘Black List’ since March 2025 for alleged violation of visa conditions, reported PTI. “This is a standard global practice that if a person is found violating visa conditions, he/she can be black listed,” the source said.
Ramesh stressed that the scholar held a valid five-year visa.
Her work on Hindi and Urdu literary cultures, he noted, has “enriched our collective understanding of India's composite cultural heritage—to which the 'bhakt brigade' is allergic.”
He also highlighted her contributions: “Her classic 'The Hindi Public Sphere 1920-1940: Language and Literature in the Age of Nationalism' was first published in 2002 and its Hindi edition came out in 2010.”
Not everyone agreed with the accolades.
Author Amish Tripathi commented on X, “I have no views on this scholar Francesca Orsini. Had never heard of her. But those of us from a rooted background, who speak Hindi at home, read Hindi books as well, can only roll our eyes at this rather bizarre claim that 'few have shaped our understanding' of Hindi literary culture like a British SOAS Prof!” while replying to a tweet.
The story of her deportation was first reported by The Wire. Its editor, Siddharth Varadarajan, cited unnamed government sources justifying the move, but he criticised the rationale.
""Think about this for a second. Orsini is a professor of Hindi, her most celebrated work is on the Hindi public sphere. So what these officials are suggesting is that if she comes to India on a tourist visa, she cannot speak to people in Hindi, cannot meet friends who are Hindi scholars, cannot watch a Hindi play or attend a mushaira or Kavi sammelan as all this would be considered 'research'!"" Varadarajan wrote.
Orsini, an Italian scholar, specialises in South Asian literature, particularly Hindi and Urdu. She completed her BA in Hindi from Venice University, studied further at the Central Institute of Hindi and Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, and later earned her PhD at SOAS, where she focused on the Hindi literary public sphere of the 1920s and 1930s.
She taught at Cambridge University before joining SOAS in 2006 and retired as Professor Emerita of Hindi and South Asian Literature.
The deportation has also drawn criticism from historians.
Earlier, Ramachandra Guha called Orsini a scholar “whose work has richly illuminated our understanding of our own cultural heritage” and said, “To deport her without reason is the mark of a government that is insecure, paranoid, and even stupid.”
Mukul Kesavan added that the episode reflects the “visceral hostility” of the NDA government toward scholars and scholarship.",The Telegraph,2025-10-23T08:31:25Z,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/hostility-to-independent-scholarship-congress-condemns-deportation-of-francesca-orsini/cid/2129162,0.4,2025-10-23 17:23:24.876234,,-0.5137254901960784
BA,Aryan Khan's Next Directorial Project To Be A Superhero Saga After Ba***ds of Bollywood?,"Aryan Khan to direct a Bollywood superhero universe based on Raj Comics, starting with Super Commando Dhruva and Doga, after acclaim for The Ba***ds of Bollywood.

After making a splash with his directorial debut The Ba**ds of Bollywood, Aryan Khan is gearing up for a much bigger adventure and this time, it is in the world of superheroes! The young filmmaker is reportedly all set to kick off a Bollywood superhero universe inspired by Raj Comics, bringing some of India’s most iconic comic book characters to the big screen. Fans are already buzzing about what Aryan has in store, with Super Commando Dhruva rumored to headline the first film and Doga slated for the second. An official announcement is expected in January 2026, and filming is planned to begin shortly after.

Aryan Khan received widespread acclaim for The Ba**ds of Bollywood, which premiered on Netflix on September 18, 2025, and was backed by Gauri Khan. The film featured a star-studded cast including Lakshya, Bobby Deol, Sahher Bambba, Raghav Juyal, Mona Singh, and Anya Singh. Aryan’s work on the project earned him praise from industry veterans, including Salman Khan, who commended his directorial efforts at the Joy Forum in Riyadh.

Aryan is now set to explore the superhero genre, aiming to adapt iconic characters from Raj Comics for Indian audiences. The universe is expected to include characters such as Super Commando Dhruva, Nagraj, Doga, and others.

According to reports circulating on social media, Aryan has secured a collaboration with Raj Comics, including its owners, the Gupta brothers.

BA,Aryan Khan's Acting Plans Revealed; Rajat Bedi Says SRK's Son May Face Camera 'Thode Waqt Baad',"Last Updated:October 23, 2025, 14:14 IST

Rajat Bedi reveals Aryan Khan’s acting plans, saying Shah Rukh Khan’s son wants to wait before stepping in front of the camera. “Papa jahan pohonch chuke hain…”

When a star kid steps into Bollywood, it’s almost taken for granted that they’ll follow in their parents’ footsteps and become an actor. But Aryan Khan, son of superstar Shah Rukh Khan, chose a different path — one that led him behind the camera. Earlier this year, Aryan made his debut as a writer and director with his hit Netflix series The Ba***ds of Bollywood, which has earned rave reviews for its sharp writing and bold storytelling.

However, before the show premiered, it was Aryan’s screen presence in the announcement teaser that stole hearts. Many fans couldn’t stop gushing over his charisma and smile, wondering if he would ever appear on screen like his legendary father. Now, actor Rajat Bedi, who played Jaraj Saxena in Aryan’s directorial debut, has shed light on the young filmmaker’s acting aspirations.

“The World Is Waiting for You to Face the Camera""

In an interview with Instant Bollywood, Rajat recalled his first meeting with Aryan and shared how impressed he was by the 27-year-old’s clarity and confidence.

“On the very first day, he told me, ‘Sir, I’ve written something, and I’m going to direct it,’"" Rajat said. “I asked him, ‘You’re going to direct?’ I told him, ‘Beta, the whole world is waiting for you to face the camera! What are you doing behind it?’""

To this, Aryan had a calm and grounded response. “He said, ‘No sir, the level my father has reached — the comparisons, expectations, and all of that… But maybe later, I’ll think about acting. Not now.’""

Rajat Bedi Was Moved by Aryan’s Conviction

Rajat further revealed that Aryan was deeply involved in the creative process and personally approached him for the role. “He told me, ‘Sir, I’m making something, and I want you to play this character. If you don’t do it, I’ll remove this character altogether. I genuinely want you to be part of it.’ I was really touched by his sincerity.""

Rajat’s performance as Jaraj Saxena in The Ba***ds of Bollywood became one of the show’s highlights, earning praise for both his dialogue delivery and the way his character was written.

Will Aryan Khan Ever Act?

While Aryan has made it clear that he’s in no rush to step in front of the camera, fans continue to hope that he will one day make his acting debut. With his effortless charm and deep understanding of filmmaking, it’s only a matter of time before the young Khan brings his artistry full circle.

For now, audiences are eagerly awaiting Season 2 of The Ba***ds of Bollywood — and perhaps, someday soon, Aryan’s long-awaited entry as an actor.

XOM,Stocks Retreat on Chipmaker Weakness and Renewed China Tensions,"The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed down -0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.71%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -0.99%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -0.52%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -0.96%.

Stock indexes settled lower on Wednesday as the broader market was under pressure throughout the session, with chipmakers selling off after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that fell below expectations. Also, Netflix closed down more than -9% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS. Other corporate earnings results on Wednesday were supportive for stocks. Intuitive Surgical rose more than +13% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial rose more than +1% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS.

Stock losses accelerated Wednesday afternoon after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering broad restrictions on exports to China made with US software in retaliation for China’s latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.84%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.4 bp to 3.949%. T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled slightly higher. Wednesday’s slump in stocks, sparked by renewed China trade tensions, triggered short covering in T-notes and pushed prices higher. T-notes maintained modest gain on Wednesday due to strong demand for the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields were mixed on Wednesday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +1.1 bp to 2.563%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and finished down -6.0 bp to 4.417%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, “The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive,” and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

Texas Instruments (TXN) closed down more than -5% to lead chipmakers lower after forecasting Q4 revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus of $4.50 billion. Also, ON Semiconductor (ON) closed down more than -5%, and Microchip Technology (MCHP) closed down more than -4%.

Finally, Analog Devices (ADI), KLA Corp (KLAC), ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), GlobalFoundries (GFS), Lam Research (LRCX), Micron Technology (MU), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) all closed down by more than 2%.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks retreated on Wednesday as the price of Bitcoin fell more than -2%. As a result, Coinbase Global (COIN), Galaxy Digital (GLXY), MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Strategy (MSTR) closed down more than -4%.

Lennox International (LII) closed down by more than -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after cutting its full-year EPS forecast to $22.75-$23.25 from a previous estimate of $23.25-$24.25.

Netflix (NFLX) is down more than -10% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q3 EPS of $5.87, well below the consensus of $6.94.

Avery Dennison (AVY) closed up more than +9% after reporting Q3 adjusted EPS of $2.37, better than the consensus of $2.33, and announcing a pact with Walmart where Walmart will use Avery’s sensor technology that brings RFID-enabled labels to Walmart’s fresh-food departments.

Energy producers and energy service providers rallied on Wednesday after the price of WTI crude oil rose more than +2% to a 1-week high. Halliburton (HAL) closed up more than +4% and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) closed up more than +3%. Also, Phillips 66 (PSX), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Valero Energy (VLO) closed up more than +2%.

XOM,Stocks Retreat on Chipmaker Weakness and Renewed China Tensions,"The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed down -0.53%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.71%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -0.99%. December E-mini S&P futures (ESZ25) fell -0.52%, and December E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQZ25) fell -0.96%.

Stock indexes settled lower on Wednesday as the broader market was under pressure throughout the session, with chipmakers selling off after Texas Instruments forecasted Q4 revenue that fell below expectations. Also, Netflix closed down more than -9% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 EPS. Other corporate earnings results on Wednesday were supportive for stocks. Intuitive Surgical rose more than +13% after boosting its worldwide Da Vinci procedure growth forecast for the whole year. Also, Capital One Financial rose more than +1% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS.

Stock losses accelerated Wednesday afternoon after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering broad restrictions on exports to China made with US software in retaliation for China’s latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

The markets are focusing on progress in US-China trade talks, as President Trump reiterated his threat on Monday to boost tariffs on Chinese goods “if there isn’t a deal” by November 1. President Trump is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in South Korea.

US MBA mortgage applications fell -0.3% in the week ended October 17, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -5.2% and the refinancing sub-index up +4.0%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.37% from 6.42% in the prior week.

The shutdown of the US government continues into its fourth week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports. The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including the last three weeks of weekly initial unemployment claims and the September payroll report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the September consumer price report, which was initially scheduled to be released last Wednesday, will be released this Friday. The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingers, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don’t align with President Trump’s priorities. Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during the shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%.

The markets this week will focus on earnings results as the Q3 earnings season continues. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 85% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021. Also, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 that have provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results are expected to beat analysts’ expectations, the highest in a year. However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2% y/y, the smallest increase in two years. Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to +5.9% y/y from 6.4% in Q2.

The markets are pricing in a 97% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.

Overseas stock markets settled lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.84%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.07%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.02%.

Interest Rates

December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +1.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -1.4 bp to 3.949%. T-notes recovered from early losses on Wednesday and settled slightly higher. Wednesday’s slump in stocks, sparked by renewed China trade tensions, triggered short covering in T-notes and pushed prices higher. T-notes maintained modest gain on Wednesday due to strong demand for the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.73, better than the 10-auction average of 2.63.

T-notes have ongoing support due to the ongoing US government shutdown, which could lead to additional job losses, reduced consumer spending, and a weakened US economy, potentially allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.

European government bond yields were mixed on Wednesday. The 10-year German bund yield rose +1.1 bp to 2.563%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 6.5-month low of 4.369% and finished down -6.0 bp to 4.417%.

UK Sep CPI rose +3.8% y/y, unchanged from Aug and weaker than expectations of +4.0% y/y. Sep core CPI unexpectedly eased to +3.5% y/y from +3.6% y/y in Aug, weaker than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

ECB Vice President Guindos said, “The current ECB interest-rate level is adequate as the path forward for inflation looks positive,” and risks to the outlook for consumer-price growth are balanced.

Swaps are discounting a 2% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30.

US Stock Movers

Texas Instruments (TXN) closed down more than -5% to lead chipmakers lower after forecasting Q4 revenue of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus of $4.50 billion.

Cryptocurrency-exposed stocks retreated on Wednesday as the price of Bitcoin fell more than -2%. As a result, Coinbase Global (COIN), Galaxy Digital (GLXY), MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Strategy (MSTR) closed down more than -4%.

Lennox International (LII) closed down by more than -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after cutting its full-year EPS forecast to $22.75-$23.25 from a previous estimate of $23.25-$24.25.

XOM,"Nvidia will someday be a distant memory -- and that's a good thing, say Nobel laureates","Research conducted by the recent Nobel laureates in economics suggests that Nvidia will not remain the largest publicly traded corporation for long.

None of the Nobel Prize winners —Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University, Philippe Aghion of the Collège de France and INSEAD in Paris, and Peter Howitt of Brown University — focused their research on Nvidia NVDA specifically. But much of their work has looked at the crucial role played by “creative destruction” in promoting long-term economic growth — and it is that which will inevitably cause Nvidia to someday be little more than a distant memory to stock-market historians.

‘We have been married for 10 years’: My children will get my estate — not my husband, who has $1.3 million. Is that fair?

After gold’s big plunge, here’s what history shows could happen next

“Creative destruction” refers to what happens “when a new and better product enters the market, [which causes] the companies selling the older products [to] lose out,” to quote from the Nobel Prize committee’s press release. “The innovation represents something new and is thus creative. However, it is also destructive, as the company whose technology becomes passé is outcompeted.”

Many investors in the losing corporations find this a hard pill to swallow. But a quick walk down memory lane is all that’s needed to remind us that, on average, investors are better off because of creative destruction. In the first half of the 19th century, the largest U.S. corporation was the Vermont Central Railroad, but you would be hard pressed to find one investor in a thousand who today has even heard of that company.

But you don’t have to go back 200 years to appreciate how much better your portfolio has performed because of creative destruction. Consider a hypothetical portfolio that, each year beginning in 1981, invested in the company that had the largest market cap as of the end of the previous year. If creative destruction were not the powerful force it is, this portfolio would have been an outstanding performer. But it hasn’t, as you can see from the accompanying chart. One hundred dollars invested in this portfolio at the beginning of 1981 would today be worth $2,640 — versus $11,729 if that $100 had instead been invested in the S&P 500 SPX.

Over the last five decades this portfolio has owned a series of Nvidias. In the 1980s, IBM IBM was at the top of the market-cap rankings, for example; in the 1990s, it was General Electric GE. Exxon Mobil XOM held that ranking in the aughts but, beginning about 10 years ago, Apple AAPL rose to the top. Now it’s Nvidia’s turn.

‘Dark clouds’

The Nobel prize winners’ research also sheds light on some of the politics involved in creative destruction, to which investors need to pay attention. On the one hand, since no one likes to be on the receiving end of the “destruction” half of creative destruction, the largest corporations and their shareholders will inevitably exert enormous pressure on our politicians for protection. On the other hand, however, as Aghion put it in his remarks after receiving his prize, “anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstruction to growth.”

Investors more often than not fail to appreciate Aghion’s insight, since the diminution in future economic growth that results from protectionism only manifests itself over the longer term. To the extent investors care only about short-term returns, they therefore think that protecting the largest corporations is a free lunch.

But it isn’t free, either for our retirement standard of living or for our children’s and grandchildren’s. Right now the Nobel laureates are concerned about a “protectionist wave in the U.S.”

A looming trade war is only one aspect of this protectionist wave. Another is the growing willingness of the federal government to acquire ownership stakes in various corporations, which will at least partially protect those companies from competition-wrought destruction. Recent examples include Intel INTC, in which the government recently acquired a 10% stake; MP Materials MP (15% stake); Lithium Americas LAC (10% stake); Trilogy Metals TMQ (10% stake); and U.S. Steel, which earlier this year was acquired by Nippon Steel but in which the government owns a so-called “golden share.”

For these and other reasons, Aghion senses “dark clouds” on the horizon, saying the protectionist wave in the U.S. is “not good for world growth and innovation.”

XOM,Why This Texas-Based Company's Stock Could Reward Long-Term Investors,"Key Points

Exxon is one of the best companies in the global oil industry.

The energy company has a plan to deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next several years.

It should have plenty of fuel to continue returning cash to investors.

10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil ›

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the undisputed leader of the global oil industry. Last quarter, its $7.1 billion of earnings and $11.5 billion of cash flow from operations led all international oil companies (IOCs). Exxon also has an industry-leading balance sheet, returned more cash to shareholders than anyone in the oil patch last quarter, and has delivered peer-leading total shareholder returns over the past five years.

The Texas-based oil giant -- Exxon's global headquarters is just north of Houston -- is in a strong position to continue rewarding its shareholders in the coming years. Here's a look at what fuels that optimistic view.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Exxon's bold plan to 2030

ExxonMobil operates under multi-year plans. Late last year, the global oil giant unveiled its plan to 2030. The company's long-term investment strategy aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in annual earnings and $30 billion in incremental cash flow by 2030. This outlook implies the company will deliver 10% compound annual earnings growth and 8% compound annual cash flow growth over the next five years. Those are solid growth rates for such a large company, especially in the volatile energy sector.

The energy company isn't banking on higher oil prices to fuel its earnings growth plan. Exxon can achieve its earnings growth target at an average Brent oil price (the global oil market benchmark) of $65 a barrel in 2030. While that's higher than the current price near $60 a barrel, Brent was over $70 a barrel at the time Exxon published its long-term outlook, and was just at its 2030 target price point a few weeks ago.

Instead, the main fuel source is Exxon's plans to invest $140 billion into high-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Notable focus areas include expanding its world-class operations in Guyana, continuing to build out its global liquefied natural gas (LNG) capabilities, and growing its leading products solutions business by developing new petrochemical and refining projects worldwide. It's also investing in several low-carbon energy businesses, including plans to build a leading lithium business in the coming years. Exxon expects to earn returns in excess of 30% over the life of these investments.

Additionally, Exxon plans to continue executing its industry-leading structural cost savings initiative. Since 2019, Exxon has delivered $13.5 billion in structural cost savings, surpassing the total of all other IOCs combined. The company expects to achieve $18 billion in cumulative structural cost savings by 2030, further boosting its bottom line.

Returning its growing cash flow gusher to shareholders

Exxon estimates that its strategic plan can generate $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash through the end of 2030 after funding its massive capital investment target. The company has the flexibility to return most, if not all, this money to shareholders.

Exxon currently has the top balance sheet in the oil patch. The company finished the second quarter with an industry-leading net debt-to-capital ratio of 8%, bolstered by a cash balance of $15.7 billion. This provides the company with tremendous financial flexibility to continue investing in its business and returning cash to shareholders, even during periods of lower oil prices.

As a result, it will undoubtedly continue increasing its dividend, something it has done for 42 straight years. That leads the oil sector. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of consecutive annual dividend increases. This growth will add to Exxon's already attractive dividend, which currently yields 3.5%, nearly triple the S&P 500's level of less than 1.2%.

Additionally, Exxon will also continue to repurchase a meaningful amount of its shares each year. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion of its stock this year and a similar amount in 2026, assuming favorable market conditions. It could buy back even more shares in 2027 and beyond, especially if oil prices improve.

A potentially very enriching plan

Exxon has delivered leading total shareholder returns over the past five years by expanding its global energy business and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Looking forward, the company's clear commitment to delivering healthy earnings growth and robust capital returns puts it in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. This high return potential makes Exxon a compelling long-term investment.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

Chevron produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, lubricants, petrochemicals, and renewable fuels across global markets.

The company operates an integrated business model, generating revenue through upstream exploration and production as well as downstream refining, chemical manufacturing, and energy marketing.

Chevron serves a diverse customer base, including industrial, commercial, and retail clients worldwide.

Chevron Corporation is one of the world’s largest integrated energy companies, with a diversified portfolio spanning upstream and downstream operations.

Foolish take

I wouldn’t look at Fourpath Capital Management’s sale of Chevron as a sign the fund is pessimistic about the Energy Sector. The fund only reduced its stake in the integreated oil company by about half.

Fourpath Capital Management made 18 new additions in the third quarter and Haliburton was one of the stocks it added. The fund completely exited two dozen positions during the third quarter, none of which were oil related.

Chevron completed its acquisition of Hess Corporation in July. When the company reports third quarter results on Oct. 31, 2025, investors will be looking for signs the increased capacity will improve profit margins.

Income seeking investors appreciate Chevron for steadily growing dividend. Over the past five years the company’s raised its quarterly payout by 32.6%. and it’s well positioned to continue its streak. It’s assets produce oil at a lower cost than any of its competitors, according to Wood Mackenzie.

XOM,Nvidia Stock at 8% of the S&P 500 Index Is a Big Problem for Investors. Let's Do the Math.,"Some More Math to Demonstrate the Point

NVDA was off 4.4% during the daily trading session on Tuesday, Oct. 14. It is about 8% of the S&P 500 index. Multiply those together, and that means NVDA alone had a negative impact of 0.36% on the S&P 500 that day alone. The whole index was down 0.12%. In other words an S&P 500 without NVDA would have actually been up 0.24%.

Yes, this is just fleeting math calculations. But the point remains: a single stock that makes up 8% of the most followed index in stock market history is a red flag.

It is about more than numbers. It also relates to the potential for investors to make decisions without adequate information. Yes, the information exists, and it is easy to find. But it may not be obvious.

The initiative is part of a broader plan to update all Taiwan dollar denominations and enhance security and sustainability features.

The Central Bank said Taiwan’s current notes have been in use for about 24 years, making it necessary to upgrade anti-counterfeiting features, per CNA. The new notes will incorporate advanced security measures that are more intuitive and noticeable, including rapid color-changing effects.

The redesign will also follow international trends toward “green banknotes,” using environmentally friendly materials and sustainable production processes to align with ESG goals. Regarding coins, the Central Bank explained that redesigning them is not cost-effective due to their low value and large quantity, so no changes are planned.

During a Legislative Yuan session, KMT Legislator Lin Szu-ming (林思銘) asked whether the NT$500 note redesign would relate to baseball. Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long (楊金龍) responded that the NT$500 note “must be changed.”

Yang explained that the back of the bill features the Formosan sika deer, which was previously a protected species. As for whether the new theme will feature baseball, Yang said the banknote theme advisory committee will make the decision.

DPP Legislator Lee Kuen-cheng (李坤城) asked whether all five denominations of Taiwan dollar notes will be redesigned. Yang replied that this can be expected.",Taiwan News,2025-10-23T09:15:19Z,https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6226629,0.4,2025-10-23 17:24:04.249883,,0.1450980392156862
LIN,Displaced Families in Ywangan Struggle With Disease and Food Shortages - Shan Herald Agency for News,"Internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Ywangan Township, southern Shan State, are suffering from widespread skin infections and remain in urgent need of medical aid, local sources said.

The Danu State National Defense Army (DSNDA) reported in a statement on September 26 that junta troops launched an offensive on September 13 into the Ya Ne village tract, setting fire to 23 civilian homes and rice granaries.

Nearly 800 residents from Kyauk Taw village, part of the Ya Ne tract, fled to nearby forests and mountains following the military’s arson attacks. Continuous heavy rain, lack of proper shelter, and food shortages have worsened living conditions, leading to outbreaks of itchy skin diseases, particularly among children and the elderly.

“Since we are fleeing the war, we are not staying in one place. We have to keep moving. Because of the rain and poor living conditions, people are developing itchy sores. There is no medicine, so we search for medicinal roots as advised by the elders. One tin of rice must feed five people,” a DSNDA information officer said.

Locals said the infections are spreading among displaced families due to the lack of proper treatment, affecting people of all ages, from toddlers to the elderly.

Junta troops are reportedly advancing into villages just six miles from Ywangan town. Residents said only one person per household is allowed to visit farms to harvest crops such as beans and betel nuts, and they must carry a recommendation letter for permission.

“If we go to the farms, only one person per family can go. We must carry a recommendation letter. The military is advancing near the betel nut farms, and we are afraid of being arrested,” a woman from Ywangan said.

She added that junta troops patrol almost daily in Tha Hpan Pin, Pei Kin, and Lin Way villages, forcing locals to live in constant fear.

“When a military column comes, there are more than five vehicles. We don’t know where to hide. We are terrified of both the military and the PDFs. The situation is so bad that we don’t even dare to move,” another woman, in her 30s, said.

Whenever the junta and Pa-O National Organization (PNO) forces launch offensives in Ywangan Township, locals report arrests, beatings, and, in some cases, men being used as human shields.

On September 14, junta troops raided Ah Lel Chaung village, detaining two women and eight men. A week later, on September 21, they attacked the Tae Pin Pyaw tract and arrested ten more residents.

Although Ywangan is not included in the first phase of the military council’s planned election in December, residents said junta troops continue to conduct daily “area clearance” operations.",Shan Herald Agency for News,2025-10-23T09:14:47Z,https://english.shannews.org/archives/28751,0.4,2025-10-23 17:24:12.977202,,-0.388235294117647

Breaking away from the usual talk-show mold, each episode begins with a friendly pickleball match between Sania and her guest, setting the tone for the conversation that follows. The format ensures that the episodes are not just talk-based but visually engaging, giving listeners and viewers a chance to see Sania in her element — athletic, witty, and authentic.

Explaining her inspiration for the show, Sania said, “Sport has always been my way of connecting with people; it breaks barriers, builds stories, and reveals character. With my new podcast, I wanted to create a space that's fun and real, where we can talk about everything from ambition to burnout, from balance to joy, without filters.”

Through Serving Up with Sania, she aims to bridge the gap between the court and the personal, discussing not just victories but vulnerabilities, struggles, and the mindset behind resilience.

Each episode will feature guests from sports, entertainment, entrepreneurship, and pop culture.

According to Amit Doshi, Head of IVM Podcasts-Pratilipi, “Serving It Up with Sania captures where podcasting in India is headed — personal, visual, and deeply relatable. Sania's voice and perspective make these conversations unmissable.”

Adding to this, Kavita Rajwade, Co-founder of IVM Podcasts-Pratilipi, said, “Everyone has got a podcast, and it is always fun to see athletes behind the mic. Happy to see Sania leading this moment for India.”

LIN,"Pooja Bedi reveals why she quit films after marriage to Farhan Furniturewala; says, 'A sex-symbol bahu was...'","Pooja Bedi has opened up about a defining moment in her life when she walked away from her flourishing film career after marriage. In a recent interview, she reflected on how marrying into a conservative Muslim family influenced her decision. There were cultural expectations and she waned to maintain harmony within her new home.

Pooja, who married businessman Farhan Furniturewala in the 1990s, shared that stepping away from films was a conscious choice rooted in mutual respect. “I got married to Farhan who came from a conservative Muslim family and there was no way on earth his family was going to accept a bahu (daughter-in-law) going to the set,” she said.

She also pointed out that during that era, actresses were often subjected to gossip and baseless link-ups, making it even harder for families to accept them. “In those days, there was a lot of gossip about the film industry, and every time a film was released, they would link you (the actress) up with the heroes… I don’t think there was any way they were going to accept a bahu still working in films,” she explained.

Calling herself “a sex-symbol bahu,” Pooja said such an image was difficult for her husband’s family to digest. “Back then, once you got married, you stopped doing films. You were off the shelf, unlike today. Also, a ‘sexy bahu‘ or a ‘sex-symbol bahu‘ would have been a lot for them to handle,” she added.

Pooja revealed that her decision to step away from films wasn’t easy. She returned all her signing amounts for several pending projects, including a renewal of her famous Kamasutra ad campaign. “I thought about it, and I was like, ‘If I’m going to do something, I want to do it well and with full respect… So, either don’t get married because it’s going to create chaos, or let yourself fit into that world and see what it’s all about,’” she recalled.

“I then returned all the signing amounts for all the films that I’d committed to; there were quite a few. My Kamasutra ad campaign had come up for renewal, and I had to reject that as well, even though I was offered about eight times the amount that they paid me originally.”

Despite parting ways with Farhan over two decades ago, Pooja shared that they continue to maintain a strong friendship while co-parenting their children, Alaya and Omar. Calling him her “best friend,” she said she was genuinely happy when he remarried to a woman she had known since childhood.",MoneyControl,2025-10-23T09:03:25Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/entertainment/bollywood/pooja-bedi-reveals-why-she-quit-films-after-marriage-to-farhan-furniturewala-says-a-sex-symbol-bahu-was-article-13629004.html,0.4,2025-10-23 17:24:17.140126,,0.1764705882352942
LIN,TV host Lee Teng scolded by wife on social media for putting their baby at risk of suffocation,"SINGAPORE – Local TV host Lee Teng’s wife has put him on blast on social media for using an unsafe method to coax their three-month-old baby to sleep, saying it made her furious.

Lee, 42, and Ms Gina Lin, 33, welcomed their son Ellison in July and announced the happy news on social media in August. She had miscarried in 2020 when she was more than six months pregnant.

On Instagram Stories on Oct 21, she disclosed that she had spent the past week caring for the boy after their confinement nanny left.

She wrote wryly that as a result, she had “successfully developed back pain, successfully lost another kilogram and successfully experienced sleep deprivation”.

She added that she was even covered in faeces after the baby suffered from constipation for three days.

“I’m not crying... but my milk supply keeps dropping,” wrote Ms Lin, who is not from the entertainment industry.

She also shared CCTV footage from the baby’s room and accused Lee of dangerous behaviour. The Taiwan-born personality was believed to have placed a small pillow on his son’s hand to avoid startling him, which should have been placed on the baby’s belly instead.

The video clip showed the pillow almost covering the baby’s face after he moved his hand, posing a risk of suffocation.

“Don’t cover the baby’s hands with either the blanket or small pillow,” she wrote in Chinese. “I don’t know how many million times I have repeated this statement to my husband. I don’t know which part he doesn’t understand? My son was gasping for breath when I walked into the room. I was so furious, I could have exploded.”

Tagging Lee in the post, she wrote: “Even you sleeping on a durian shell won’t pacify me.”

She then reiterated: “This pillow is used to cover his tummy, not to scare him. It is not used to cover his hands.”

In a subsequent post on Instagram Stories, Ms Lin said Lee did what he did after watching online videos on how to coax babies to sleep.

However, she said such methods pose risks for babies who are strong enough to move their arms. She urged new fathers not to follow online videos blindly or add their own input, which could endanger their babies.",The Straits Times,2025-10-23T08:45:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/tv-host-lee-teng-scolded-by-wife-on-social-media-for-putting-their-baby-at-risk-of-suffocation,0.4,2025-10-23 17:24:18.280054,,0.02745098039215677

NEE,Sissili: Nando's Mobile Clinic Screens for Women's Cancers,"Sissili: An awareness campaign and free screening for breast and cervical cancer was launched this Thursday, October 16 in Leo, at the initiative of the Nando Regional Health Directorate. This activity, which continues until October 17, is part of the celebration of the month of Pink October.

According to Burkina Information Agency, the event was organized in collaboration with the Leo Medical Center with Surgical Unit (CMA), and the Nando mobile clinic welcomed several dozen women into the health facility. The aim is to raise awareness among women about the risk factors and means of prevention against these pathologies, while screening for precancerous lesions.

“We came to raise awareness among women so that they can really get screened early because these are pathologies when they are screened early, the chances of survival are high so we encourage women to do self-examination and refer to health centers,” said the head of the mobile clinic, Dr. Aziz Lankoande.

On site, participants were informed about the importance of early detection. The medical team also demonstrated best practices for breast self-examination. The campaign was also a boon for pregnant women, who were able to benefit from ultrasound examinations at the mobile clinic.

All women received free screening for precancerous cervical lesions, while those aged 40 and over received an additional mammogram. “I just finished my mammogram and I am reassured that I have no breast problems; I thank the first authorities in our country who had the initiative of these mobile clinics to save us women,” testified Awa Dabire nee Yago.

For the organizers, this action will help reduce the mortality rate linked to female cancers, which are often overlooked in rural areas.

Summary

PLD remains a top holding among REITs, but the value proposition for new investors is less compelling.

PLD's stock has experienced volatility, still trading below its 5-year high after interest rate hikes impacted REIT valuations.

Since my previous ""strong buy"" rating, PLD has gained ~19%, driven by robust Q2 and Q3 2025 results.

While Q3 2025 performance was strong, new investors may face lower total return potential compared to earlier opportunities.

In light of the struggling market, geopolitical risks, and less attractive entry point, I'm turning to a hold with PLD.

Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) has always been one of my favorite REITs to invest in. One of the largest REITs globally and the largest industrial REIT has offered (and potentially still does) meaningful upside potential resulting from not only the continuous expansion of

PLD,Full court plea untenable without proof bench not competent: Justice Aminuddin,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) Constitutional Bench was requested on Monday to constitute a full court comprising all 24 judges to hear multiple petitions challenging the validity of 26th Constitutional Amendment.

An eight-member Constitutional Bench of the SC, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the petitions filed against 26th Constitutional Amendment. Other bench members included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Ayesha A Malik, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musarat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.

Around three dozen petitioners including Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), Lahore High Court Bar Association, Lahore Bar Association, Karachi Bar Association as well as former seven presidents of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and various individuals in personal capacity had challenged the validity of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.

During the course of hearing, senior lawyer and counsel for the petitioners, Muhammad Akram Sheikh, appeared in-person and contended that a full court comprising all 24 judges of the apex court, should be constituted for hearing the identical petitions, challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment.

The counsel submitted that the Constitutional Bench was not a separate court like the Federal Shariat Court, adding that it is a ‘bench’ of the Supreme Court itself. He submitted that judges sitting on the bench were members of the Supreme Court as well as members of the Constitutional Bench.

“They are, in a way, wearing two hats – one in their capacity as judges of the Supreme Court, and the other in their capacity as members of the Constitutional Bench,” Akram Sheikh contended.

The counsel further contended that in their capacity as members of the Constitutional Bench, it is logically and legally impossible for the Bench to effectively declare that the 26th Amendment was void. He submitted that an effective declaration can be issued only by court of competent jurisdiction. “If the 26th Amendment is held to be void then the very foundation on which the bench has been raised will disappear,” Sheikh submitted adding that if the amendment is void, then the constitution of the bench pursuant to it is also legally ineffective.

In that case, Akram Sheikh submitted that the very source of the judicial power of the bench to issue any declaration would cease to exist. He further submitted that in legal terms, the Constitutional Bench would have no legitimate existence in the eyes of law.

The bench cannot possibly cut the very branch on which it is sitting,” Akram Sheikh added. Therefore, he submitted that the only hat that is available to the Court for issuing an effective declaration and provide a remedy is the hat of the Supreme Court judges, while the other hat would stand dissolved in thin air.

Citing cases where matters were referred to Full Court, Akram Sheikh submitted that in previous instances involving the constitutional validity of constitutional amendments and in landmark cases, the Supreme Court constituted a larger or full bench to adjudicate upon such grave constitutional questions.

He contended that the present matter also pertains to the validity of a constitutional amendment, namely the 26th Amendment. He stressed that in the interest of justice, this case should also be placed before a full bench of the Supreme Court.

Akram Sheikh cited past judgments delivered by the Supreme Court including District Bar Association, Rawalpindi (PLD 2015 SC 401, PLD 1998 SC 161, Malik Asad Ali, PLD 2010 SC 61, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. PLD 2009 SC 879, Sindh High Court Bar. PLD 2010 SC 265 and Mubashir Hassan, PLD 2010 SC 1165, Nadeem Ahmad.)

At the outset of hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan asked the counsel to tell any constitutional way to form a full court, as they are bound by their oath. “So far, no lawyer has presented arguments in accordance with the Constitution — one even went so far as to say that we should set aside the Constitution,” Justice Aminuddin Khan added.

Akram Sheikh responded that the SC full bench, comprising all 24 judges, should be formed, and maintained that the current Constitutional Bench is not competent to hear this case, as the 26th Amendment itself is controversial.

“Even dictators had never caused such a deep dent in the Constitution as the 26th Amendment,” Sheikh contended, adding that since this eight-member bench was itself constituted under the 26th Amendment, it cannot declare that amendment null and void.

Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, however, observed that this is a new matter, adding that a Constitutional Bench has now been constituted. Justice Mazhar advised Akram Sheikh to present his arguments in light of the new situation. “You say this bench cannot annul the 26th Amendment due to conflict of interest, yet you also suggest forming a full court of twenty-four judges,” Justice Mazhar told the counsel.

“Wouldn’t there also be a conflict of interest there,” he questioned. Justice Aminuddin Khan reiterated that unless the petitioners prove this bench is not competent to hear the case, their request cannot be accepted.

Akram Sheikh responded that he wants to settle the issue once and for all and that’s why he stresses constituting a full court comprising all 24 judges of the apex court. “This is my personal view that a full court including all 24 judges should hear the instant petitions,” Sheikh added.

Similarly, he submitted that his position was that if a judge’s conscience is disturbed then he should not hear the case. “But I have not asked for the recusal of any judge as well,” Akram Sheikh clarified.

Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, addressing the counsel, said: “You have expressed a desire that all twenty-four judges of the Supreme Court hear this case, but you haven’t explained how that wish can be fulfilled.

“Your wish is like a spoiled child asking for the moon,” the judge added. Akram Sheikh further submitted that lots have been done and lots have been faced with. Let us make this institution envisioned by father of the nation Quaid-e-Azam and envisioned by the Constitution.

Justice Jamal Mandokhail remarked that Father of the Nation Quaid-e-Azam was also the founding father of the Parliament and his portrait was also present in the Parliament House and the Parliament is also following the Quaid as well.

At this, Akram Sheikh responded and asked as to whether the Parliament can destroy one organ of the State, adding that can the Parliament go beyond the salient features of the Constitution and can the Parliament go beyond the basic structure of the Constitution.

Akram Sheikh concluded his arguments with a verse of poet Mirza Ghalib. Meanwhile, Shabbar Raza Rizvi, counsel for another petitioner, came to the rostrum and argued that the case should be heard by the Supreme Court as constituted under Articles 176 and 191(A) of the Constitution. He submitted that like any other bench, this bench can refer the matter to the Chief Justice or to the three-member committee responsible for bench formation.

Justice Jamal Mandokhail asked him: “If the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Committee orders for formation of a full court, then what would become of Article 191(A)(3), which states that no other bench is authorised to hear constitutional matters.”

In response, the lawyer said this is a matter concerning the independence of the judiciary, and that this bench must bear some pain. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that the Constitution already provides sufficient clarity — only the Constitutional Bench can hear constitutional matters. Later, the court adjourned the hearing for Tuesday (today) while Advocate Shabbar Raza Rizvi will continue his arguments.",The News International,2025-10-21T02:25:12Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1352459-full-court-plea-untenable-without-proof-bench-not-competent-justice-aminuddin,1.0,2025-10-23 17:25:40.041003,,0.5215686274509803
PLD,Schools Face Another Curriculum Crisis,"The President of The New Zealand Principals' Federation (NZPF), Leanne Otene, is calling for urgent changes to the implementation timeline for the New Zealand English/Mathematics and Statistics Curriculum Years 0-10, released late Sunday evening, by the Ministry of Education.

Otene says schools have wasted hours of work this past year, preparing for changes to the English and Maths curricula and at the last minute, the whole curriculum framework and delivery mode has been altered without explanation or consultation.

""With just seven weeks of the most demanding term of the school year remaining, the Minister now expects schools to undertake significant PLD and preparation for substantial changes to curriculum content and reframe the way it is delivered - all of which she expects to be implemented in February. This is an unprofessional and unachievable expectation,"" she said.

""Schools have already invested heavily in time to acquire professional development based on the February 2025 mandated Mathematics/ Statistics and English Curriculum. We were told to get on with it. With the current radical and unexpected changes to both Mathematics/ Statistics and English, Principals are now losing trust in the Minister and the system,""

Principals report that they are expected to rewrite different planning formats, make different resource selections and completely revise teaching sequences and phases of learning. Principals say they are shocked at the extent of the changes.

""What the Minister wants now, is a simple age-based year by year sequence of learning, irrespective of whether a child is well ahead of the curriculum year level or well below it,"" said Otene. The reality is that our classrooms have never delivered a one year level curriculum since the 1950s.

""We have repeatedly told the Minister for the last two years that learning must occur in a framework of broader phases of learning - not year levels - so that we can accommodate learners who, for many different reasons, are either well ahead or struggling to keep up,"" she said."" ""It was our understanding that the Minister supported children learning at the level they were at, rather than at an arbitrary year level,"" said Otene.

NZPF is calling on the Minister to rethink the latest ‘learning by year-level’ approach; to provide further PLD funding and dedicated teacher only days for the relearning required to meet the latest curriculum framework and expectations; to scrap the February 2026 implementation date and to impose a moratorium on further curriculum releases until the new English and maths curricula are fully and successfully embedded.

""Our students deserve better than a curriculum implemented on the run,"" said Otene.",Scoop,2025-10-21T02:25:51Z,https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ED2510/S00026/schools-face-another-curriculum-crisis.htm,0.8,2025-10-23 17:25:40.763302,,-0.09019607843137256

But this week, the company reported a quarter that made people forget the tougher times, and it married that with a report of a very positive outlook.”

“I love Moghadam. He’s terrific. I am not as keen on the warehouse market right now. I think that there’s, I think you have too much space in it, and I don’t think they need that, they’re going to put up as many as before. But if I got a price break, if I got it down to here, I would take action. But right now, I’m not. I’ve got other stocks I like more. I don’t feel that I need to take a position in Prologis. Great company, I just don’t feel I need that position.”

Impact of COVID-19

COVID-19 positively impacted the market. At that time, people were compelled to stay at home, and business organizations were compelled to provide an entirely remote workplace in anticipation of the mandate of Work from Home (WFH) from the respective governments. Also, schools were encouraged to follow smart education and learning by accessing the Professional Learning and Development (PLD) programs to work remotely with the students. The adoption of distance education and learning due to this outbreak is expected to favorably impact the industry’s growth. Organizations can seek it as an excellent opportunity to deal with their distance learning policy by getting the right tools in place and being prepared for a similar situation in the future. They also made sure that teachers and students working remotely had the tools they required, such as VPN collaboration and videoconferencing solutions and access to critical documents. Besides, governments worldwide are recommending smart education and learning solutions and are providing portals for online tutorials.

Regional Insights

The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This is because of the increase in demand for quality education and skills development, coupled with the rapid expansion of internet connectivity and mobile device adoption in the region. Additionally, there are developing economies like those in China, Japan, and India. The market is expected to grow as a result of government-driven initiatives, such as programs funded by the government that aim to improve literacy in rural areas. One example of an online library offering academic content for various levels of smart education and learning is the National Digital Library of India, which was established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
